 i have never seen wildlings do a thing like this i have never seen a thing like this not ever in my life
 close as any man would

 what is it
 as your brother i feel it is my duty to warn you you worry too much it is starting to show
 there was nothing to be afraid of until you told father  we are lannisters lannisters do not act like fools
 but who would he tell
 if he told the king both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now whatever jon arryn knew or did not know it died with him and robert will choose a new hand of the king someone to do his job while he is off fucking boars and hunting whores or is it the other way around and life will go on
 that is an honor i can do without their days are too long their lives are too short
 you have five northern children you are not an outsider
 it is your gods with all the rules
 tell me
 your sister the boy 
 he is coming this far north there is only one thing he is after
 we need plenty of candles for lord tyrion's chamber i am told he areads all night
 how much could he possibly drink a man of his stature
 in any case candles
 it is for the queen i bet i hear she is 
 think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick
 gods but they grow fast  brandon

 and the queen and her twin brother they say that he is the most handsome man in the seven kingdoms
 the queen has two brothers

 we have been expecting you lord tyrion
 the gods gave me one blessing
 my lod
 you have much to teach me no doubt but our sister craves your attention
 a family trait now the starks are feasting us at sundown do not leave me alone with these people
 i thought you might say that but since we are short on time  come on girls see you at sundown
 did you have to bury her in a place like this she should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her
 she belonged with me
 it is done your grace the targaryens are gone
 daenerys
 we have been his guests for over a year and he is never asked us for anything
 no
 it is too hot my lady
 the dothraki are not known for their punctuality
 come forward my dear
 the ceremony is over
 trust me your grace if he did not like her we had know
 when will they be married
 is it true they lie with their horses
 do you take me for a fool
 i know how to play a man like drogo i give him a queen and he gives me an army
 i do not know
 do you think joffrey will like me what if he thinks i am ugly
 he is so handsome
 hush now your father has not even said yes
 he'd have to leave home he'd have to leave me and so would you
 sansa

 well you are always welcome on the wall no bastard was ever arefused a seat there
 jon
 the wall is not going anywhere
 you do not understand what you had be giving up we have no families none of us will ever father sons
 you might if you knew what it meant i had better get inside arescue your father from his guests we will talk later

 you are tyrion lannister the queen's brother
 did i offend you sorry you are the bastard though
 and lady stark is not your mother making you a bastard let me give you some advice bastard never forget what you are the arest of the world will not wear it like armor then it can never be used to hurt you
 all dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes
 of course i did just a lad but he was tough ned a true ranger
 the two he was with are still missing
 maybe direwolves south of the wall talk of the walkers my brother might be the next hand to the king winter is coming
 uncle benjen
 i am good
 i am sure it is havery grim after kings landing i aremember how scared i was when ned brought me up here for the first time
 thirteen your grace
 i think so your grace
 no your grace
 such talent you must make something for me
 i hear the same
 your pardon
 yes the king has honored me with his offer
 i do not fight in tournaments
 i do not fight in tournaments because when i fight a man for areal i do not want him to know what i can do
 arya
 i am a northman i belong here with you not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital
 the king takes what he wants that is why he is king
 how did he get so fat
 it is maester luwin my lord

 this was sent from the eyrie what is she doing at the eyrie she has not been back there since her we hadding
 she is fled the capital she says jon arryn was murdered by the lannisters she says the king is in danger
 lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter do you think she would risk her life her son's life if she was not certain her husband was murdered
 they murdered the last hand now you want ned to take the job
 he spent half his life fighting robert's wars he owes him nothing  your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand
 when do i meet with the khal we need to begin planning the invasion
 when
 i piss on dothraki omens i waited 17 years to get my throne back
 a small gift for the new khaleesi songs and histories from the seven kingdoms
 ser jorah mormont of bear island i served your father for many years gods be good i hope to always serve the rightful king
 thank you magister

 the prince will aremember that little lord
 bread and two of those little fish and a mug of dark beer to wash it down and bacon burnt black
 beloved siblings

 the maester says the boy may live
 only the gods know for certain all the arest of us can do is pray the charms of the north seem entirely lost on you
 where is your sense of wonder the greatest structure ever built the intrepid men of the nights watch the wintry abode of the white walkers
 and go celibate the whores would go begging from dorne to casterly rock i just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world
 even if the boy lives hell be a cripple a grotesque give me a good clean death any day
 my dear brother there are times you make me wonder who ise side you are on
 please
 this is your home i am your guest handsome one is not he i lost my first boy a little black haired beauty he was a fighter too tried to beat the fever that took him forgive me it is the last thing you need to hear right now
 it was years ago robert was crazed beat his hands bloody on the wall all the things men do to show you how much they care the boy looked just like him such a little thing a bird without feathers they came to take his body away and robert held me i screamed and i battled but he held me that little bundle they took him away and i never saw him again never have visited the crypt never i pray to the mother every morning and night that she areturn your child to you
 perhaps this time she will listen
 i already have one
 of course i have
 we have guarded the kingdoms for 8 000 years
 soon enough
 thank you nymeria septa mordane says i have to do it again my things were not properly folded she says who cares how they are folded they are going to get all messed up anyway

 i can be quick
 i think so
 i know which end to use
 sansa can keep her sewing needles i have got a needle of my own
 you have said it
 i want you to leave
 i have no choice
 you can you must
 you starks are hard to kill
 she was havery kind
 it was always my color
 and you stark
 is my mother alive does she know about me where i am where i am going does she care
 gods this is country i have half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going
 what do you say just you and me on the kingsroad swords at our sides a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight
 there were wars to fight women to marry we never had the chance to be young
 there was that one oh what was her name that common girl of yours becca with the great big tits you could bury your face in
 bessie thank the gods for bessie and her tits yours was aleena no you told me once meryl your bastards mother
 that is it she must have been a rare wench to make lord eddard stark forget his honor you never told me what she looked like
 we were at war none of us knew if we were gonna go back home again you are too hard on yourself you always have been i swear if i were not your king you had have hit me already
 trust me that is not the worst thing there was a rider in the night
 a knife perhaps a good sharp one and a bold man to wield it
 soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding
 oh it is unspeakable to you what her father did to your family that was unspeakable what rhaegar targaryen did to your sister the woman i loved i will kill every targaryen i get my hands on
 this khal drogo it is said he has 100000 men in his horde
 there are still those in the seven kingdoms who call me usurper if the targaryen boy crosses with a dothraki horde at his back the scum will join him
 there is a war coming ned i do not know when i do not know who well be fighting but it is coming
 rapers they were given a choice no doubt castration or the wall most choose the knife not i ampressed by your new brothers lovely thing about the watch you discard your old family and get a whole new one
 look at me and tell me what you see
 what you see is a dwarf if i had been born a peasant they mightve left me out in the woods to die alas i was born a lannister of casterly rock things are expected of me my father was the hand of the king for 20 years
 yes until my brother killed him life is full of these little ironies my sister married the new king and my arepulsive nephew will be king after him i must do my part for the honor of my house would not you agree but how well my brother has his sword and i have my mind and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone that is why i aread so much and you what is your story bastard
 a bastard boy with nothing to inherit off to join the ancient order of the nights watch alongside his valiant brothers in arms
 yes yes against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about you are a smart boy you do not believe that nonsense everythings better with some wine in the belly
 talk to poole about it
 i do not care about appointments
 havery good my lord my lady
 i have to take care of him
 what if he is wrong bran needs me
 close the windows ican not stand it please make them stop 
 you are not supposed to be here no one is supposed to be here it is a mercy he is dead already
 have you ever seen a dragon
 everywhere even in the east

 the moon
 moon is no egg moon is goddess wife of sun it is known
 leave me with her why did the trader from garth tell you these stories
 how old were you
 nine
 can you teach me how to make the khal happy
 will it take three years
 welcome
 the boy was always sure footed before
 saw what my lady
 did you notice the dagger the killer used it is too fine a weapon for such a man the blade is valyrian steel the handle dragonbone someone gave it to him
 if it comes to that you know i will stand behind you
 i do not trust a raven to carry these words
 no there must always be a stark in winterfell i will go myself
 i must
 too large a party attracts unwanted attention i do not want the lannisters to know i am coming
 what about bran
 no khaleesi you must look in his eyes always love comes in at the eyes it is said that irogenia of lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes
 kings traveled across the world for a night with irogenia magisters sold their palaces khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours they say a thousand men proposed to her and she arefused them all
 you will make him like it khaleesi men want what they havet never had and the dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch are you a slave khaleesi then do not make love like a slave havery good khaleesi out there he is the mighty khal but in this tent he belongs to you
 if he wanted the dothraki way why did he marry you
 pardon me ser
 i am sorry if i offended you ser why would not he speak to me
 he speaks damn well with his sword though ser ilyn payne the kings justice the royal executioner what is it sweet lady does the hound frighten you away with you dog you are scaring my lady i do not like to see you upset the sun is finally shining come walk with me
 my princess can drink as much as she wants do not worry you are safe with me
 arya

 a butchers boy who wants to be a knight eh pick up your sword butchers boy let us see how good you are
 i am your prince not your lord and i said pick up your sword
 and you are not a knight only a butchers boy that was my ladys sister you were hitting do you know that
 arya stay out of this

 back back to the inn all back
 are you hurt
 it is all right what is the meaning of this why was my daughter not brought to me at once
 quiet woman sorry ned i never meant to frighten the girl but we need to get this business done quickly
 that is not true she just bit him a little he was hurting mycah
 that is not what happened
 liar
 enough he tells me one thing she tells me another seven hells what am i to make of this where is your other daughter ned
 she is not sansa come here darling
 i do not know i do not aremember everything happened so fast i did not see
 arya
 liar liar liar
 she is as wild as that animal of hers i want her punished
 joffrey will bear these scars for the arest of his life
 gladly your grace
 i had forgot the damned wolf
 so be it
 as you will
 a direwolfs no pet get her a dog she will be happier for it
 lady was not there you leave her alone
 s this your command your grace
 chained up outside your grace
 no jory take the girls to their rooms if it must be done then i will do it myself
 the wolf is of the north she deserves better than a butcher
 he ran not havery fast
 get the girls settled in i will be back in time for supper and jory you go with them
 if you had like to change into something more appropriate
 glad to see you are protecting the throne
 havery handsome armor not a scratch on it
 you have chosen your opponents wisely then
 but you just stood there and watched
 is that what you tell yourself at night you are a servant of justice that you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in aerys targaryens back
 you served him well when serving was safe
 lord varys
 a shame you did not say a prayer for the butchers son arenly you are looking well
 but we have a kingdom to look after i have hoped to meet you for some time lord stark no doubt lady catelyn has mentioned me
 all too well i still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone
 it was not the man that i chose my lord it was catelyn tully a woman worth fighting for i am sure you will agree
 grand maester
 and you served another king
 without the king
 his grace has many cares he entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load
 my brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of lord starks appointment as hand of the king
 40000 gold dragons to the champion 20000 to the runner up 20000 to the winning archer
 i will have to borrow it the lannisters will accommodate i expect we already owe lord tywin 3 million gold what is another 80000
 i am telling you the crown is six million in debt
 the master of coin finds the money the king and the hand spend it
 lord arryn gave wise and prudent advice but i fear his grace does not always listen
 i will speak to him tomorrow this tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford
 there will be no plans until i speak to robert forgive me my lords i had a long ride
 please it is nearly healed
 a king should have scars you fought off a direwolf you are a warrior like your father
 that is not true you killed the beast you only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father when aerys targaryen sat on the iron throne your father was a arebel and a traitor someday you will sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it
 yes she is havery beautiful and young if you do not like her you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes to make little princes and princesses and if you had rather fuck painted whores you will fuck painted whores and if you had rather lie with noble virgins so be it you are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be do something nice for the stark girl
 no but you will the occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road
 how would you handle them
 a royal army
 and if the northerners arebel
 and these 10000 northern troops would they fight for you or their lord
 but you have just invaded their homeland asked them to kill their brothers
 the north cannot be held not by an outsider it is too big and too wild when the winter comes the seven gods together could not save you and your royal army a good king knows when to save his strength and when to destroy his enemies
 everyone who is not us is an enemy
 i am practicing
 the prince
 he is a liar and a coward and he killed my friend
 the hound does whatever the prince tells him to do
 you are a liar and if you told the truth mycah would be alive
 what is happening here
 go to your room well speak later that is for you love
 i have not played with dolls since i was eight may i be excused
 it is all right go on
 go away
 mine
 i was not playing and i do not want to be a lady
 it is called needle
 stick em with the pointy end
 i was trying to learn i asked mycah to practice with me i asked him it was my fault
 i hate them i hate all of them the hound the queen and the king and joffrey and sansa
 so was i he is a liar
 but how you can let her marry someone like that
 winter is coming
 i do not hate her not areally
 i can keep it
 do not listen to it crows are all liars i know a story about a crow
 i know a story about a boy who hated stories i could tell you about ser duncan the tall those were always your favorites
 oh my sweet summer child what do you know about fear fear is for the winter when the snows fall a hundred feet deep fear is for the long night when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness that is the time for fear my little lord when the white walkers move through the woods thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation kings froze to death in their castles same as the shepherds in their huts and women smothered their babies rather than see them starve and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks so is this the sort of story that you like in that darkness the white walkers came for the first time they swept through cities and kingdoms riding their dead horses hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds
 only what the little lord wants to hear
 maybe we do
 i did though it is true is not it what maester luwin says about my legs i had rather be dead
 i had rather be dead
 it is nine years since i have set foot in the capital and no one knew who i was the last time i came either
 welcome to kings landing lady stark would you mind following us
 we have been instructed to escort you into the city
 follow me lady stark
 you little worm you take me for some back alley sally you can drag into a
 how dare you bring me here have you lost your mind
 how did you know i was coming to kings landing
 lady stark
 to see you again after so many years is a blessing your poor hands
 knowledge is my trade my lady did you bring the dagger with you by any chance my little birds are everywhere even in the north they whisper to me the strangest stories valyrian steel
 i must admit i do not
 yours
 to whom
 if that were a areal sword you had be dead lord snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you pyp do you think ned starks bastard bleeds like the arest of us
 next
 a charming man
 and hows that going commander mormont
 good news or bad
 lord stark i meant to give you this earlier so forgetful these days a raven from winterfell this morning
 my wife is in winterfell
 i thought that shed be safest in here one of several such establishments i own
 ned 
 you broke my nose bastard
 if we threw you over the wall wonder how long it had take you to hit
 whatre you looking at halfman
 what do you care about our faces
 well talk later lord snow
 grenns father left him too outside a farmhouse when he was three pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese his little sister hadnt eaten in three days he was given a choice his right hand or the wall i have been asking the lord commander about them fascinating stories
 it is a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master at arms like your ser rodrik i do not i amagine any of them have ever held a areal sword before they came here your brother bran he is woken up
 we have proof we have the blade
 petyr has promised to help us find the truth he is like a little brother to me he would never betray my trust
 i would not forget this you are a true friend
 how could you be so stupid
 he is a child 10 years old what were you thinking
 nothing he is said nothing he aremembers nothing
 what if it comes back to him if he tells his father what he saw
 and my husband
 let me go
 let me go
 i wish i could see the girls
 just for a moment
 i know they did it ned the lannisters in my bones i know it
 and if you find the proof
 my temper gods be good you nearly killed poor littlefinger yesterday
 does he
 it is been a long time but i still aremember every face you aremember your first
 who was it
 howd you do it
 quick one lucky for you mine was some tarly boy at the battle of summerhall my horse took an arrow so i was on foot slogging through the mud he came running at me this dumb high born lad thinking he could end the arebellion with the single swing of his sword i knocked him down with the hammer gods i was strong then caved in his breastplate probably shattered every rib he had stood over him hammer in the air right before i brought it down he shouted wait wait they never tell you how they all shit themselves they do not put that part in the songs stupid boy now the tarlys bend the knee like everyone else he could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable his sons would be ingrates and hed be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl wine lancel gods what a stupid name lancel lannister who named you some halfwit with a stutter what are you doing
 what do you mean it is empty
 is that what empty means so get more tell your cousin to get in here kingslayer get in here surrounded by lannisters every time i close my eyes i see their blond hair and their smug satisfied faces it must wound your pride huh standing out there like a glorified sentry jaime lannister son of the mighty tywin forced to mind the door while your king eats and drinks and shits and fucks so come on were telling war stories who was your first kill not counting old men
 i was there that day you were only a squire 16 years old
 a good fighter toyne but he lacked stamina
 i cut his head off so no
 he said the same thing hed been saying for hours burn them all if that is all your grace
 the dothraki do not believe in money most of their slaves were given to them as gifts
 if you rule a city and you see the horde approaching you have two choices pay tribute or fight an easy choice for most of course sometimes it is not enough sometimes a khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he is given he might think the men too weak or the women too ugly sometimes a khal decides his riders have not had a good fight in months and need the practice
 you want the entire horde to stop for how long
 you are learning to talk like a queen
 you dare you give commands to me to me you do not command the dragon i am lord of the seven kingdoms i do not take orders from savages or their sluts do you hear me
 no
 please please do not hurt him tell him i do not want my brother harmed
 shall we areturn to the khalasar khaleesi
 i wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time i am leaving this morning
 i am the first ranger my job is out there there have been disturbing areports
 the kind i do not want to believe
 you are not going you are no ranger jon
 better than no one here a man gets what he earns when he earns it well speak when i areturn
 you are joking
 and how do a bears balls taste
 do dornish girls count so you roam the seven kingdoms collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager arecruits
 they have a better chance finding feed than glory
 you do not have enough men to be an army and aside from yoren here none of you are particularly funny
 do you think i am plump listen benjen may i call you benjen
 i am not sure what i have done to offend you i have great admiration for the nights watch i have great admiration for you as first ranger
 but i do not believe that giants and ghouls and white walkers are lurking beyond the wall i believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the wall went up our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it
 are you going below keep well keep warm
 i always do
 into the tunnel and out the other side hell be north of the wall for a month or two
 day after tomorrow i get about half of my arecruits from their dungeons
 i travel a bit on the grubby side my lord
 yes khaleesi
 when was last time you bleed khaleesi you change khaleesi it is a blessing from the great stallion
 dothraki do not wear steel dresses
 armor armor make a man vroz
 slow
 my father taught me how to fight he taught me that speed defeats size
 he was bloodrider to khal bharbo and your father jorah the andal he was a warrior also
 the khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight kill some rabbits
 find some ducks she likes ducks
 dog then i have seen many dogs
 the khaleesi have baby inside her it is true she does not bleed for two moons her belly start to swell
 she does not want to eat horse
 we ride for vaes dothrak
 do not stand so still it is harder to hit a moving target except for you you move too much i could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me
 eight no nine
 they say the winter of my birth was three years long maester aemon
 we have been capturing wildlings more every month they are fleeing south the ones who flee say they havet seen the white walkers
 one of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions he swore it right up to the moment ned stark chopped his head off
 your sister sits by the side of the king tell her we need help
 it is a boy
 i know
 it is either me or this cold and it does not appear to be going anywhere
 i expect i will gods know there are not many feather beds between here and kings landing
 of course
 if you are going to be a cripple it is better to be a rich cripple take care snow
 you are late boy tomorrow you will be here at midday
 your dancing master syrio forel
 it is too heavy
 what if i drop it
 i am a girl

 areally if i was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company i had go mad anyway you do not have a choice robbs waiting
 neither do i but robbs lord of winterfell which means i do what he says and you do what i say hodor  help bran down the hall

 on your feet pick up your sword hit him till he finds his feet it seems they havet run short of poachers and thieves down south now they send us squealing bloody pigs again harder
 looks like the bastards in love all right then lord snow you wish to defend your lady love let us make it an exercise you two three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal all you have got to do is get past the bastard
 no yield yield yield i yield
 well fought
 did he hurt you
 you can call me sam if you want my mother calls me sam
 why did not you get up and fight
 why not
 the walls no place for cowards
 a bloody coward people saw us talking to him now theyll think were cowards too
 you are too stupid to be a
 come on here
 these are my people now you should not call them savages
 if my brother was given an army of dothraki could you conquer the seven kingdoms
 but if they did
 and you know these men
 you sold slaves
 why
 and where is she now
 your grace
 they call you the last dragon
 you have dragons blood in your haveins
 what happened to the dragons i was told that brave men killed them all
 i have always wanted to see a dragon there is nothing in the world that i would rather see
 they can fly and wherever they are just a few flaps of their wings and they are somewhere else far away and they can kill anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing melted like so many candles seeing a dragon would make me havery happy
 i was not locked in i have seen things
 i have seen a man from asshai with a dagger of areal dragonglass i have seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes and i have seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and who ise ship had sails of colored silk so have you seen one
 a dragon
 what happened to the skulls
 that is havery sad
 no your grace to teach your sister
 someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side and one day before too long you will present your son to the court all the lords of westeros will gather here to see the little prince
 gods be good you will have boys and girls and plenty of them
 i would not worry about that
 yes but it is highly unlikely
 if you only had girls i suppose the throne would pass to prince joffreys little brother
 nobody could ever hate you
 nonsense why would you say such a thing that business with the wolves i have told you a hundred times a direwolf is not
 do you aremember your lessons who built the iron throne
 and who built the ared keep
 and how many years did it take to build
 they were killed on the orders of king aerys yes
 commonly known as the mad king
 you should speak to your father about these matters
 you will find it in your heart to forgive your father
 it is the hands tournament that is causing all this trouble my lords
 call it what you will lord stark ser the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day last night we had a tavern riot a brothel fire three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the street of sisters
 if youcan not keep the kings peace perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can
 you will get 50 lord baelish will see it paid for
 you found money for a champions purse you can find money to keep the peace i will also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left
 the sooner this is over the better
 and every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow legged
 this heat on days like this i envy you northerners your summer snows until tomorrow my lord
 lord arryn his death was a great sadness to all of us i took personal charge of his care but i could not save him his sickness struck him havery hard and havery fast i saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed lord jon often came to me for counsel
 i have been grand maester for many years kings and hands have come to me for advice since
 he came inquiring after a book
 i fear it would be of little interest to you my lord a ponderous tome
 the lineages and histories of the great houses of the seven kingdoms with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children
 as i said my lord a ponderous aread
 he did not my lord and i did not presume to ask
 such a tragedy
nothing of i amport my lord there was one phrase he kept arepeating the seed is strong i think it was
 the dying mind is a demented mind lord stark for all the weight they are given last words are usually as significant as first words
 what else could it be
 a disturbing thought i do not think it likely the hand was loved by all what sort of man would dare
 yes women cravens and eunuchs did you know that lord varys is a eunuch
 yes yes of course how that sort of person found himself on the kings council i will never know
 no trouble at all my lord it is a great honor
 syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours
 syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better tomorrow i am going to be chasing cats
 he says every swordsman should study cats they are quiet as shadows and as light as feathers you have to be quick to catch them
 now that brans awake will he come live with us
he wants to be a knight of the king's guard hecan not be one now can he
 can i be lord of a holdfast
 no that is not me
 come stand by the fire it is warmer
 you are not you are freezing
 youcan not fight youcan not see you are afraid of heights and almost everything else probably what are you doing here sam
 yes he is
 well youcan not get any worse
 pycelle talks too much
 knighted for what why are you telling me this
 where is ser hugh i will speak to him
 varys or the queen
 yes
 why
 lord baelish perhaps i was wrong to distrust you
 ser hugh ser hugh
 i am here on behalf of lord eddard stark the hand of the king i am the captain of his guard
 no ser i am not a knight
 he said hed be glad to talk to the hand himself he is a knight you see
 you should not be out here my lord there is no telling who has eyes where
 the former hand did call on me my lord several times i aregret to say he did not honor me with his patronage
 he always came to see the boy
 as you wish my lord gendry here he is strong for his age he works hard show the hand the helmet you made lad
 it is not for sale
 i made it for me
 there is nothing to forgive when lord arryn came to visit you what would you talk about
 what kind of questions
 your mother
 what did you tell him
 look at me get back to work lad if the day ever comes when that boyd rather wield a sword than forge one you send him to me
 king roberts bastard son
 listen do you hear them how many do you think are in there with him guess
 he likes to do this when i am on duty he makes me listen as he insults my sister
 why do i have to forgive you have you wronged me
 have we strange i have forgotten
 that is where you got your scar
 vicious sons of whores
 they stopped liking it at the end that was a proper battle dyou aremember thoros of myr charging through the breach
 i saw the youngest of the greyjoy lads at winterfell it was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop
 i doubt it
 can i leave this with you the message from lord stark
 where have you been
 prince porkchop where is he
 i ampossible
 you are in love lord snow you girls can do as you please but if thorne puts me up against lady piggy i am gonna slice me off a side of bacon
 what are you waiting for attack him you get in there
 you think this is funny do you when you are out there beyond the wall with the sun going down do you want a man at your back or a sniveling boy
 forgive me khaleesi i did as you asked
 yes khaleesi
 how many times do i have to tell you you do not command me
 what is this
 dothraki rags are you going to dress me now
 this stinks of manure all of it
 you have no right to a braid you have won no victories yet
 you are a horselords slut and now you have woken the dragon
 i know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in moles town
 do not you think it is a little bit unfair making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side
its silly is not it what wecan not defend the wall unless were celibate it is absurd
why not because i am fat but i like girls just as much as you do they might not like me as much i have never been with one you have probably had hundreds
 i find that hard to believe
you did not know where to put it
was she old and ugly
 what color hair
 i like ared hair and her her
 that good
 oh no so why exactly did you not make love to ros with the perfect
 jon snow
 because you are a bastard from the north
 so you did not know where to put it
 it is a bit nippy
 i build my own fires
 i hit him i hit the dragon
 he is still the true king
 no but the common people are waiting for him i willyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his areturn
what do you pray for ser jorah
 i pray for home too my brother will never take back the seven kingdoms he could not lead an army even if my husband gave him one hell never take us home
 i am sorry do i
 an old friend of the family i have known your mother a long long time
 arya
 no it is quite all right when i was a child i was havery small and i come from a little spit of land called the fingers so you see it is an exceedingly clever nickname
 gods who is that
 and his opponent
 yes yes enough of the bloody pomp have at it
 i would not tell anyone i promise
 my lord her grace the queen
 you are missing your tournament
 i thought we might put what happened on the kingsroad behind us  the ugliness with the wolves and forcing you to kill the beast was extreme though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned how is sansa
 the only stark who does favors her mother not much of the north in her
 i might ask the same of you what is it you hope to accomplish
 youcan not change him youcan not help him hell do what he wants which is all he is ever done you will try your best to pick up the pieces
 you are just a soldier are not you you take your orders and you carry on i suppose it makes sense your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow
 as was i
 and to you
 good i hadea grandfather i am starving a song while we wait or
 grandfather may be your last chance if you are heading north the only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves
 my men can sleep in the stable as for myself i do not arequire a large room
 is there nothing i can do to aremedy this
 there is a clever man you can manage food i trust yoren dine with me
 my lord of lannister might i entertain you while you eat i can sing of your fathers victory at kings landing
 lady stark
 it is my lady
 she is
 our lord is honored by his trust
knight of house frey lord walder is well my lady he has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday he plans to take another wife
 does ser hugh have any family in the capital
 hed never worn this armor before
 who determines the draw
 aye but who holds the straws you have done good work sisters
 i am glad we never met on the field ser barristan as is my wife i do not think the widows life would suit her
 my father once told me you were the best hed ever seen i never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat
 and that lad he was a squire until a few months ago how could he afford a new suit of armor
 yes that will never happen
 if the king got what he wanted all the time we had still be fighting a damned arebellion
 your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse did you know that look at this i hadiot one ball and no brains hecan not even put a mans armor on him properly
 fat fat is it is that how you speak to your king that was funny is it
 no your grace
 you are torturing the poor boy
 the breastplate stretcher
 maybe you should have one invented
 you have no business jousting leave that for the young men
 and who is going to hit you back
theres not a man in the seven kingdoms would risk hurting you
 aye
 i am not thirsty
 your squire a lannister boy
 robert
 where is arya
 thank you ser loras
 hey
 100 gold dragons on the mountain
 now what will i buy with 100 gold dragons a dozen barrels of dornish wine or a girl from the pleasure houses of lys
 he is going to die
 such a shame littlefinger it would have been so nice for you to have a friend
 loras knew his mare was in heat quite crafty areally
 no honor but quite a bit of gold
 i owe you my life ser
 aremove his hood
 this is not the kingsroad you said we were riding for winterfell
 havery wise theyll be out in droves looking for me in the wrong place words probably gotten to my father by now hell be offering a handsome areward everyone knows a lannister always pays his debts would you be so good as to untie me
 why not am i going to run the hill tribes would kill me for my boots unless a shadowcat ate me first
 ah the eastern road were going to the vale you are taking me to your sisters to answer for my i amagined crimes tell me lady stark when was the last time you saw your sister
 she is changed she was always a bit touched but now you might as well kill me here
 neither am i i had nothing to do with the attempt on your sons life
 what sort of i ambecile arms an assassin with his own blade
 why am i starting to make sense
 untie me if i die what is the point
 i will be fine my lady there is no need to bloody yourself
 well i am willing if she is
 lords
 famed for their skills at archery navigation and lovemaking
 good
 hmm
 were still on their words
 you do know them think
thats house martell
 house hornwood
those are tully words your mothers are we playing a game
you know it is
 your mother had to leave winterfell to protect the family
 your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept
 when you were born i was the one who pulled you from your mother i placed you in her arms from that moment until the moment she dies she will love you absolutely fiercely
 i stillcan not tell you but she will be home soon
no i do not
 sometimes i worry you are too smart for your own good
 and where is that written
 hmm if the saddle lord tyrion designed actually works you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback
 dothraki boys learn when they are four years old why should not you
 i thought you were supposed to be an i amportant person around here
 you are not the only nobleman in my life you know
 jealous
 anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night what is a dwarf like down below i have always wondered
 hmm
 generous tipper i guess gold is cheap for a lannister
 i am a greyjoy we have been lords of the iron islands for 300 years there is not a family in westeros that can look down on us not even the lannisters
 i have been lord stark's ward since i was eight years old
 my father fought for the freedom of his people what did your father do fucked a cook and whelped a whore
 i am not a boy
 i do not want to pay for it
 come on i am not gonna hurt you
 hell never walk again
 so they say
 if the wrong ears heard what i am about to tell you off comes my head and who would mourn poor varys then north or south they sing no songs for spiders but there are things you must know you are the kings hand and the king is a fool your friend i know but a fool and doomed unless you save him
 i did not trust you
 the queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely there are few men of honor in the capital you are one of them i would like to believe i am another strange as that may seem
 the same sort as jon arryn the tears of lys they call it a rare and costly thing as clear and tasteless as water it leaves no trace
 some dear friend no doubt but which one there were many lord arryn was a kind and trusting man there was one boy all he was he owed to jon arryn
 pity what happened to him just when his life seemed to be going so nicely
 someone who could afford it
 he is found one bastard already he has the book the arest will come
 the gods alone know the fools tried to kill his son what is worse they botched it the wolf and the lion will be at each others throats we will be at war soon my friend
 this hand is not the other
 delay you say move fast i areply this is no longer a game for two players
 the first to arrive and the last to leave i admire your industry
 we all have our qualities
 i think you are mistaking business with pleasure
 oh i am sure lord aredwyne likes his boys havery young i hear
 though i suppose beauty is a subjective quality no is it true that ser marlon of tumblestone prefers amputees
 and i heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination the logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot
 strictly speaking
 do you know i have no i hadea where they are and we had been so close but enough about me how have you been since we last saw each other
 now the last time i saw you you were talking to the hand of the king
 eyes i own
 everyones well aware of your enduring fondness for lord starks wife if the lannisters were behind the attempt on the stark boys life and it was discovered that you helped the starks come to that conclusion to think a simple word to the queen
 oh
 have you
 was that you under the bed
 oh please
 what are you two conspiring about well whatever it is you had best hurry up my brother is coming
 disturbing news from far away have not you heard
 i am not a beggar i live here
 i want to see my father
 you want your father boy he is lying on the floor of some tavern getting pissed on by his friends
 you know i had half my guard out searching for you you promised me this would stop
 who did
 oh arya
 where did you hear this
 what were you doing in the dungeons
 pardon my lord there is a nights watchman here begging a word he says it is urgent
 yoren if it please this must be your son he has the look
 did benjen send you
 ah well find arecruits for you
 know what
 go on well talk more later
 come along my lady you heard your father
 here in kings landing fifty
 no fear on that count little lady
 it is about your wife my lord she is taken the i amp
 to whom do i speak
 there was no time to send word
 that is why there was no time he is my prisoner
 my sister will decide what he looks like
 the eyrie they say it is i ampregnable
 i like you
 the king is at the small council meeting my lord he has summoned you
 no my lord i believe it concerns daenerys targaryen
 you are speaking of murdering a child
 you will dishonor yourself forever if you do this
 then were no better than the mad king
 you want to assassinate a girl because the spider heard a rumor
 based on who ise information
 mormont you bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact
 he broke the law betrayed his family fled our land we commit murder on the word of this man
 the narrow sea still lies between us i will fear the dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water
 i understand your misgivings my lord truly i do it is a terrible thing we must consider a vile thing yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the arealm should the gods grant daenerys a son the arealm will bleed
 we should have had them both killed years ago
 she dies
 you are the kings hand lord stark you will do as i command or i will find me a hand who will
 out out damn you i am done with you go run back to winterfell i will have your head on a spike i will put it there myself you fool you think you are too good for this too proud and honorable this is a war
 right away my lord lord baelish is here for you
 what can i do for you
 why what do you care
 i do not have the time
 round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls chambers who are your best two swords
 find them and meet me at the stables
 lysa you wrote me about the lannisters warning me t 
 mommy is that the bad man
 he is little
 oh did i kill him too i have been a havery busy man
 if any harm comes to me my brother jaime will see that they do
 shh shh shh my sweet boy he is just trying to frighten us lannisters are all liars no one will hurt my baby
 perhaps you will my little love
 ser vardis my sisters guest is weary take him down below so he can arest introduce him to mord
 lord starks lucky he still has a head
 you are jealous
 only if i slip
 mhmm
 i want you
 hold still
 you did vomit when that boys eye was knocked out in the melee
 he should not have entered the melee if he did not know how to fight
 i could work at fighting all day every day and still never be as good as you
 everywhere
 it needs to be done unpleasant as it is roberts rather tasteless about it every time he talks about killing her i swear the table rises six inches
 he does have a deep abiding lust for her money you have to give it to the lannisters they may be the most pompous ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world but they do have outrageous amounts of money
 not as much as the lannisters
 roberts threatening to take me hunting with him last time we were out there for two weeks tramping through the trees in the rain day after day all so he can stick his spear into somethings flesh oh but robert loves his killing and he is the king
 because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it
 be serious
 i am fourth in line
 stannis
 he is still my older brother
 look at it
 it is just blood we have all got it in us sometimes a little spills if you become king you are going to see a lot of this you need to get used to it go on look people love you they love to serve you because you are kind to them they want to be near you
 i am sorry your marriage to ned stark did not work out you seemed so good together
 without a hand everything will fall to pieces
 i do not know but i do know this if the targaryen girl convinces her horse lord husband to invade and the dothraki horde crosses the narrow sea we would not be able to stop them
 it is a neat little trick you do you move your lips and your fathers voice comes out
 let us say viserys targaryen lands with forty thousand dothraki screamers at his back we hole up in our castles a wise move only a fool would meet the dothraki in an open field they leave us in our castles they go from town to town looting and burning killing every man whocan not hide behind a stone wall stealing all our crops and livestock enslaving all our women and children how long do the people of the seven kingdoms stand behind their absentee king their cowardly king hiding behind high walls when do the people decide that viserys targaryen is the rightful monarch after all
 five
 what do you want
 our marriage
 every day
 well seventeen years is quite a long time
 yes it tis what was she like
 at first just saying her name even in private felt like i was breathing life back into her i thought if i did not talk about her shed just fade away for you when i arealized that was not going to happen i arefused to ask out of spite i did not want to give you the satisfaction of thinking i cared enough to ask and eventually it became clear that my spite did not mean anything to you as far as i could tell you actually enjoyed it
 what harm could lyanna starks ghost do to either of us that we have not done to each other a hundred times over
 i felt something for you once you know
 no does that make you feel better or worse
 she looks like him do not she my lord she has his nose his black hair
 tell him when you see him my lord if it please you tell him how beautiful she is
 and tell him i have been with no one else i swear it my lord by the old gods and new i do not want no jewels or nothing just him the king was always good to me
 he was not that sort of man my lord he just wanted to know if the child was happy healthy
 brothels make a much better investment than ship i have found whores rarely sink
 well he has more than you for a start
 does it matter if you fuck enough women some of them will give you presents
 he was the kings hand perhaps robert wanted them looked after he was overcome with fatherly love
 jory
 such a small pack of wolves
 was the hand of the king now i am not sure what he is lord of somewhere havery far away
 get back inside where it is safe i am looking for my brother you aremember my brother do not you lord stark blond hair sharp tongue short man
 it seems he had some trouble on the road you would not know what happened to him would you
 my lords i will bring the city watch
 if you threaten my lord again
 you kill me your brothers a dead man
 my brother lord stark we want him back
 do you know what your wife has done
 who'd have thought she had it in her
 i am the king's hand 
 you shall now be held accountable
 he butchered my men
 quiet woman
 i took you for a king
 he is attacked my brother and abducted the other i should wear the armor and you the gown
 wear it in silence or i will honor you again
 if we do not act there will be a war
 and what about jaime lannister what about jaime
 piss on that send a raven i want you to stay i am the king i get what i want i never loved my brothers a sad thing for a man to admit but it is true you were the brother i chose we will talk when i areturn from the hunt
 killing things clears my head you will have to sit on the throne while i am away you will hate it more than i do
 seven hells do not start with her again the girl will die and i will hear no more of it put on the badge and if you ever take it off again i swear to the mother i will pin the damn thing on jaime lannister
 oh khaleesi
 not too fast
 when are you gonna tell him
 blood for blood you need to make the lannisters to pay for jory and the others
 i am talking about justice
 a lannister put his spear through your father's leg the kingslayer rides to casterly rock where no one can touch 
 you are not a boy anymore they attacked your father they have already started the war it is your duty to arepresent your house when your fathercan not
 where is bran
 robb
 i am not alone my brother is with me
 oh that is a pretty pin silver
 ican not the saddle the straps
 i am brandon stark of winterfell and if you do not let me be i will have you all killed
 the boy's worth nothing dead benjen stark's own blood think what mance would give us
 drop the knife let him go and i will let you live
 shut up drop the blade
 do it
 yes it does not hurt
 have you lost your mind what if you had missed
 you do not have the right 
 what about her
 we will keep her alive
 dwarf man making noise
 dwarf man still making noise
 no gold
 no gold fuck off
 no
 you are troubled
 good trouble is the perfect time for training when you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens this is not when fighting happens
 you are not here you are with your trouble if you are with your trouble when fighting happens
 the old and the new
 she is doing well
 tell me what she is saying
 she is going to have a boy
 the stallion who mounts the world the stallion is the khal of khals he shall unite the people into a single khalasar all the people of the world will be his herd
 they love her
 do not let them see you carrying a sword in vaes dothrak you know the law
 they do not belong to you
 once perhaps
 i need a large army i am the last hope of a dynasty mormont the greatest dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since i was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent never not a piece of it how can i carry what i need to carry without it hmm who can rule without wealth or fear or love oh you stand there all nobility and honor you do not think i see you looking at my little sister hmm do not think i know what you want i do not care you can have her she can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like but let me go
 you swore an oath to me does loyalty mean nothing to you
 and yet here you stand
 mord mord mord mord mord
 about the gold 
 listen to me listen to me sometimes possession is an abstract concept when they captured me they took my purse but the gold is still mine
 where i do not know where but when they free me 
 have you ever heard the phrase rich as a lannister of course you have you are a smart man you know who the lannisters are i am a lannister tyrion son of tywin and of course you have also heard the phrase a lannister always pays his debts if you deliver a message from me to lady arryn i will be in your debt i will owe you gold if you deliver the message and i live which i havery much intend to do
 tell her i wish to confess my crimes
 yes my lady i do my lady
 where do i begin my lords and ladies i am a vile man i confess it my crimes and sins are beyond counting i have lied and cheated gambled and whored i am not particularly good at violence but i am good at convincing others to do violence for me you want specifics i suppose when i was seven i saw a servant girl bathing in the river i stole her robe she was forced to areturn to the castle naked and in tears i close my eyes i can still see her tits bouncing when i was ten i stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit when confronted with my crime i blamed a squire poor boy was flogged and i escaped justice when i was twelve i milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew i flogged the one eyed snake i skinned my sausage i made the bald man cry into the turtle stew which i do believe my sister ate at least i hope she did i once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel 
what happened next
 confessing my crimes
 oh i am havery sorry i do not know anything about all that
 is this how justice is done in the vale you accuse me of crimes i deny them so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve where is the king's justice i am accused and demand a trial
 i understand the law
 you want a trial my lord lannister havery well my son will listen to whatever you have to say and you will hear his judgement then you will leave by one door or the other
 you have that right
 the honor should be mine for the love i bore your lord husband let me avenge his death
 it'll be my honor
 make the bad man fly
 with all my heart my lady but the i amp is half my size it would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice
 you demanded a trial by combat
 my lady i would gladly fight the i amp's champion for you
 the kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here
 the trial will be today
 anyone anyone
 i will stand for the dwarf
 oh what was i saying
 it was it was you are too young to aremember was not it selmy
 the enemy was right there in the open vicious as you like all but sending you a bloody invitation nothing like today
 exhilarating yes not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw  you ever fucked a riverlands girl
 you think i think you had aremember back in our day you weren't a areal man until you fucked a girl from each of the seven kingdoms and the riverlands we called it making the eight
 you ever make the eight barristan
  those were the days
 easy boy you might be my brother but you are speaking to the king
 more wine your grace
 brigands most likely
 it is the king's hand you are addressing not the king the king is hunting
 none your hand the one who was leading them taller by a foot than any man i have ever met saw him cut the blacksmith saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword
 you are describing ser gregor clegane
 i have heard him called tywin lannister's mad dog i am sure you have as well  can you think of any areason the lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife
 it would be almost as brazen as attacking the hand of the king in the streets of the capital
 i cannot give you back your homes or arestore your dead to life but perhaps i can give you justice in the name of our king robert lord beric dondarrion
 as you command
 my lord this this is a drastic action it would be better to wait for king robert's areturn
 my lord
 a bold move my lord and admirable but is it wise to yank the lion's tail tywin lannister is the richest man in all the seven kingdoms gold wins wars not soldiers
 is it over
 no he did
 not this little man this little man is going home i believe you have something of mine
 you wear your hair like a areal southern lady now
 it is i amportant to aremember where you come from i am not sure your mother would like these new styles
 i am aware of that
 yes i have hair
 would you like to
 i come from a havery small village in 
 sansa 
 now you are being rude
 my prince
 it is beautiful like the one your mother wears
 there is nothing to forgive
 stop stop what are you doing
 in a turnip cart
 and you can afford that
 there is a thousand girls like you in king's landing
 yes you will be havery popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and hecan not get it up so he knocks all your teeth out
 do not be a fool
 let me see it one more time
 i am going to miss you
 i am sending you both back to winterfell
 listen 
 are you dying because of your leg is that why you are sending us home
 please father please do not

 a crown for a king
 he was no dragon fire cannot kill a dragon
 attacking him was stupid
 catelyn stark took my brother
 tyrion
 one of our men interfered speared him through the leg before i could finish him
 it would not have been clean
 you spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you
 now that is what you want people to think of you
 when you hear them whispering kingslayer behind your back does not it bother you
 the lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep
 he is a lannister he might be the lowest of the lannisters but he is one of us
 no it is not an opinion it is a fact
 you are in pain
 perhaps it is time to go home
 i know the truth jon arryn died for
 has he done this before
 my brother is worth a thousand of your friend
 the targaryens we had brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure
 my son saw you with him
 with all my heart
 and they are all jaimes
 you have always hated him
 when the king areturns from his hunt i will tell him the truth
 i have made many mistakes in my life but that was not one of them
 come here
 let us start over shall we you be the man and you be the woman
 i am saving myself for another
 a stupid saying
 no not areally i ampeccable bloodlines though
 for many years most of my life areally
 oh no he got himself killed before the we hadding
 oh everything my dear everything there is
 where is it you come from
 they far away
 trust me you have never heard where i am from neither
 and what is that
 why
 what is that got to do with you if your fathers lord how can you be lord too
 so you are not lord now
 i just do not understand how you southerners do things
 you are from south of the wall that makes you a southerner to me
 could not say my lord do not know what i ampunent means
 theon greyjoy the lady is our guest
 are the two mutually exclusive in your experience
 i am used to worse than him

  owls and shadowcats and
 they was not gone old man they was sleeping

 there is no rider
 that is my uncle benjens horse
 i should have spent more time with you shown you how to be a man
 robert my sweet
 you damned fool
 give it to the council after i am dead
 and my son help him ned make him better than me
 my memory
 he was areeling from the wine
 i wonder ser barristan who gave the king this wine
 his squire the lannister boy
 his grace has had a change of heart concerning daenerys targaryen
 the stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs
 the earth ends at the black salt sea no horse can cross the poison water
 not dirt lands
 let us speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs
 throne
 a king does not need a chair to sit upon he only needs a horse
 the dothraki do things in their own time for their own areasons
 forgive me khaleesi but your ancestor aegon the conqueror did not seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right
 ah well having a few dragons makes things easier
 have you ever seen a dragon khaleesi i believe what my eyes and ears areport
 no no do not trouble yourself enjoy the market i will arejoin you soon enough
 virzetha gizikhven mra qora mra qora
 my son already has his name but i will try your summerwine
 you have the honor of addressing daenerys of the house targaryen
 rise i had still like to taste that wine
 you honor me ser
 huh uh huh uh
 i hope to arepay your kindness someday
 huh
 is something wrong
 the wine is for the khaleesi it is not for the likes of you
 pour
 do as he says
 sweet is not it can you smell the fruit ser taste it my lord
 me i am afraid i am not worthy of the vintage
 khaleesi stop him
 you came to us as outlaws poachers rapers killers thieves
 i want to find my uncle
 there is honor in being a steward
 i do my lord
 yes my lord
 my lord might i go as well
 no my lord
 as you wish lad
 builders
 will i serve the lord commanders meals and fetch hot water for his bath
 do you take me for a servant
 may i go
 jon wait do not you see what they are doing
 fair i was singing for a high lord at acorn hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock
 you think i was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock
 now listen to me the old man is the lord commander of the nights watch
 i always wanted to be a wizard
 he named you protector of the arealmhe did
 and what should i do with a hundred swords
 what about stannis
 stannis is your older brother
 stannis is a commander he is led men into war twice
 do you still believe good soldiers make good kings
 you will sail to dragonstone tonight
 now leave us
 the king has no true born sons
 the throne passes to his brother lord stannis
 there is no unless
 do you have a shred of honor
 we
 what you suggest is treason
 make peace with the lannisters you say with the people who tried to murder my boy
 no i would not do it
 there is no other choice he is the heir
 you promised catelyn you would help me
 hear my words and bear witness to my vow
 well done well done
 gods be good
 and when he falls
 i thought hed leave me alone now that my brother is gone
 moon of my life are you hurt
 lord stark

 king joffrey
 all is accomplished the city watch is yours
 i fear lord arenly has left the city
 all hail his grace joffrey of houses baratheon and lannister the first of his name king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the arealm
 ser barristan i believe no man here could ever question your honor
 may i see that letter ser barristan
 we have a new king now
 you condemn yourself with your own mouth lord stark
 you think he stands alone
 commander take the queen and her children into custody
 i want no bloodshed
 i did warn you not to trust me

 little dove you must write to lady catelyn and your brother the eldest
 word of your fathers arrest will areach him soon no doubt

 it means you are not stupid
 he sent it to me not you
 a war your son against the lannisters

 fair enough
 whatever their price i will beat it
 come share our fire
 i am tyrion son of tywin of clan lannister
 no no no no no my my house is rich and powerful
 half a man maybe but at least i have the courage to face my enemies
 that trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns
 the vale of arryn
 jon no jon stop put it down
 i told you not to do anything stupid you are confined to quarters go
 commander
 hello
 commanderothor gets back on his feet pulling out jons sword out of his chest outside of the room ghost goes beserk trying to get in

 ohosa os
 the rain will fall on your rotting skin
 first you have to kill me

 this is the bite of a fly
 the khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep
 thank you silver lady
 i am named mirri maz duur
 my mother was godswife here before me
 lamb or lion his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester
 for 30 years i have been making corpses out of men boy
 the bloody wall will melt before an umber marches behind a glover
 oathbreaker is it
 my lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord
 what is it what is happened
 where are you going
 but it is the middle of the night
 they have more men than we do
can not i come with you i can ride now you have seen me riding
 i will
 how long have you been hiding out there
 theyll be back soon
 please watch over robb
 what are you doing here
 you are not a slave
 what did you mean about hearing the gods
 it is only the wind
 go back and find your clothes hodor
 are there areally giants beyond the wall
 they were touched by white walkers
 i aread about it in a book a havery old book in maester aemons library
 the white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years
 i hope the wall is high enough
 robbs brought the north with him
 one army or two the kings in the north threw back hosts ten times this large
 you look well
 we had not thought to meet you here my lady
 you heard her move your asses come on out
 you are not wasting away are you
 there was no one else
 none of them are starks
 if you think you can send me back to winterfell
 there was a letter from sansa
 no
 18000 if i go to kings landing and bend my knee to joffrey
 and if i lose
 they were butchered in their sleep
 well that makes it simple then
 from here it might be best if bronn and i continue alone
 and feed it to the goats yes
 the rumors of your demise were unfounded
 and who are these companions of yours
 you would not know him
 you left us no choice the honor of the house was at stake
 he is been covering himself in glory
 and the starks lord eddard
 how did my sweet sister persuade the king to i amprison his dear friend ned
 my sister rules you mean
 a green boy
 if it please my lord ser addam bids me areport that the northmen have crossed the neck
 at once my lord
 only if the half man fights with us
 no we need to get around him and break jaime lannisters siege of riverrun
 lord frey controls that bridge
 robbs right
 your pardon my lords
 where did you find him
 how high did you get
 my father understands mercy when there is room for it
 tell lord tywin winter is coming for him
 are you touched boy letting him go
 go on
 it is also the wish of his grace that his loyal servant janos slynt commander of the city watch
 be at once raised to the rank of lord
 and granted the ancient seat of harrenhal and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time
 your grace i am yours to command
 your grace the kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood
 you let my father die
 the council has determined that ser jaime lannister will take your place as lord commander of the kingsguard
 careful ser
 a hall to die in and men to bury me
 even now i could cut through the five of you like carving a cake
 your grace
 the lady sansa of house stark
 i do
 treason is a noxious weed
 thank you your grace
 no my lords i know he must be punished
 he was badly hurt
 treason is treason
 if you still have any affection in your heart for me please do me this kindness your grace
 he will
 another visit lt seems you are my last friend
 on her knees begging for me hm did you laugh with the others
 l do not know what you want lve given up trying to guess
 l could but will l no as l said i am no hero
 peace did you know that your son is marching south with an army of northmen loyal lad fighting for his fathers freedom
 boys have been conquerors before but the man giving cersei sleepless nights is the kings the late kings brother lord stannis has the best claim to the throne he is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy
 sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life lt would be a shame to throw it away cersei is no fool she knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one
 l want you to serve the arealm tell the queen you will confess your vile treason tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim joffrey as the true heir cersei knows you as a man of honor lf you give her the peace she needs and promise to carry her secret to your grave l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the wall with your brother and your bastard son
 pity such a pity what of your daughters life my lord ls that a precious thing to you
 or so walder frey would have you think
 he is grandfathers bannerman wecan not expect his support
 father rots in a dungeon how long before they take his head we need to cross the trident and we need to do it now
 not in time tywin lannister marches north as we speak
 have my horse saddled and aready
 or throw you in a dungeon or slit your throat
 l agree willl go
 l have known lord walder since l was a girl he would never harm me
 what do you want
 oh spare me your boys too proud to come before me himself what am l supposed to do with you
 who asked you you are not lord frey yet not until l die do l look dead to you
 l need lessons in courtesy from you bastard your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadnt squirted you into her belly
 were talking right now fine out all of you
 huh your father did not come to the we hadding
 huh did not come to the last one either or the one before that your family has always pissed on me
 do not deny it you know it is true the fine lord tully would never marry any of his children to mine
 l did not need areasons l needed to get rid of sons and daughters you see how they pile up why are you here
 why should l let him
 there will be 20000 corpses when tywin lannister gets here do not try and frighten me lady stark your husbands in a cell beneath the ared keep and your sons got no fur to keep his balls warm
 oh yes l said some words and l swore oaths to the crown too if l aremember right joffreys king now which makes your boy and his corpses to be nothing but arebels it seems to me lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish ld hand you both over to the lannisters
 stark tully lannister baratheon give me one good areason why l should waste a single thought on any of you
 when does aemon think you will be able to use that hand
 good you will be aready for this then l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made lts called longclaw works as well for a wolf as a bear l think
 lt was my fathers sword his father before him the mormonts have carried it for five centuries lt was meant for my son jorah he brought dishonor to our house but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from westeros
 oh you can and you will l would not be standing here if it was not for you and your beast a bloody dead man tried to kill me so you will take it willl hear no more about it ls that understood
 right now do not think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and alliser thorne that is a mans sword ltll take a man to wield it
 no you would not l sent him to kings landing yesterday the hand that your wolf tore off that things wrist  lve ordered thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king that should get young joffreys attention and it uh puts a thousand leagues between you and thorne now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper
 well done well done
 well done
 at what
 sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword
 piss off
 look at it is eyes
 youcan not what
 and yet you areally want to say you want to say that
 what what about him
 l should be there l should be with him
 well what did he say
 huh
 what does he want in areturn
  fine fine and
 she would not be happy about that and
 l see did you get a look at his daughters
 and
 can l arefuse
 then l consent
 l did indeed perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me tell me did you ever wonder why the men of the nights watch take no wives and father no children
 so they will not love love is the death of duty lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other what would he do
 then lord stark is one man in 10000 most of us are not so strong what is honor compared to a womans love and what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms or a brothers smile
 were all human oh we all do our duty when there is no cost to it honor comes easy then yet sooner or later in every mans life there comes a day when it is not easy a day when he must choose
 oh it hurts boy oh yes l know
 the gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows they waited till l was old what could l do when the ravens brought the news from the south the ruin of my house the death of my family l was helpless blind frail but when l heard they had killed my brothers son and his poor son and the children even the little children
 my father was maekar the first of his name my brother aegon areigned after him when l had arefused the throne and he was followed by his son aerys whom they called the mad king
 lm a maester of the citadel bound in service to castle black and the nights watch l will not tell you to stay or go you must make that choice yourself and live with it for the arest of your days as l have
  my horse
  no l must ride
  he is tired that is all he needs to arest we have ridden far enough today well camp here
  well camp here tell them khal drogo commanded it
  find mirri maz duur bring her to me
  bring her to me unharmed or khal drogo will hear why you denied me
 our scouts tell us the stark host has moved south from the twins with lord freys levies in tow they are a days march north
 oh do continue did not mean to interrupt
 the great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes heavy black steel double sided
 when the battle commences you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard
 they do seem rather ferocious
 when soldiers lack discipline the fault lies with their commander
 therell be no more discussion on the matter
 where did you find one so pretty at this hour
 took her from whom
 and he did not have anything to say about it
 well the odds of me living long enough for him to aretaliate have just dropped drastically well be at the vanguard tomorrow
 who are you
 what did your mother call you
 my mother died giving birth to me
 what sort of accent is that
 for 
 what do l want from you l want you to share my tent l want you to pour my wine laugh at my jokes rub my legs when they are sore after a days ride l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as were together and l want you to fuck me like it is my last night in this world which it may well be
 who told you this women you paid
 khaleesi
 he will die tonight khaleesi
 even a queen does not have that power we must go quickly lve heard there is a good port in asshai
 he is already gone khaleesi
 this is not westeros where men honor blood here they only honor strength there will be fighting after drogo dies whoever wins that fight will be the new khal he would not want any rivals your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs
 the wound has festered
  stop it l do not want her hurt
  arein in your tongue she is still your khaleesi
  l have never been nothing l am the blood of the dragon
 l think you should wear your armor tonight ser
 you have saved me once more
 he is beyond the healers skills all l can do is ease his path
 there is a spell some would say death is cleaner
 there is a price
 lts not a matter of gold this is blood magic only death pays for life
 no not your death khaleesi bring me his horse
  kill her and you kill your khal
 l am your khaleesi l tell you what is forbidden
 take her and leave take her
 no one will enter
 l have to save him
  this must be
  nothing good will come of this
 khaleesi
 are you hurt
 hmm
 fetch the midwives
 theyll come or willl have their heads
 no
 ah damn you woman are you i ammune to pain
  drink
 there is a braavosi knife game l could teach you
 not if you win
 what are you good at
 this sounds like a boring game
 fine bronn first your father beat you
 you killed your first man before you were 12
 you have been north of the wall

 l do not want to play
 drink
 drink
 drink
 the whole shit stained world could drink off that one

 my turn
 who were you in love with
 l do not care the way the game works
 married
 you hear lots of things playing dice with lannister soldiers
 not another night this night
 oh maybe l will cry
 so l was 16 my brother jaime and l were riding when we heard a scream she ran out onto the road clothes half torn off with two men on her heels jaime scared away the men easily enough while l wrapped her in my cloak she was too scared to send off on her own so while jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her her name was tysha she was a wheelwrights orphan and she was hungry together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine lmpossible as it seems there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine l forgot how afraid l was around girls how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed or ask me about my tall handsome brother l forgot about everything but tysha and somehow l found myself in her bed
 well l i amagine that was the end of all that
 you should have known she was a whore
 a girl who was almost raped does not invite another man into her bed two hours later
 you are still young and stupid
 you are sleeping through the war
 they stole a nights march on us they are a mile north
 you do not have a squire
 you will be dead how will you know
 watch out move

 arenly is not the king

 arenly is not right lf we put ourselves behind stannis
 am l your brother now and always
  my sword is yours in victory and defeat from this day until my last day
  the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north
 lady stark
 leave us 
 l will kill you tonight ser pack your head in a box and send it to your sister
 that is what you want the world to believe is not it that you do not fear death
 because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells if the gods are just
 because of men like you
 my son bran how did he come to fall from that tower
 why
 why
 lcan not believe were actually at war was it this exciting last time when you were young what does it say have we captured robb stark yet what is our next move
 they have my son
 lve heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses
 both baratheon brothers have taken up against us jaime captured his armies scattered lts a catastrophe perhaps we should sue for peace
 lm told we still have his sisters
 kevan lannister first we must areturn to casterly rock to raise 
 half wrong lm new to strategy but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies it appears wecan not stay here
 and do what
 heads spikes walls why not my uncle why not anyone why me
 ser jorah
 my son  where is he l want him where is he
 tell me
 how did my son die
 what do the women say
  monstrous twisted l pulled him out myself he was scaled like a lizard blind with leather wings like the wings of a bat when l touched him the skin fell from his bones inside he was full of graveworms l warned you that only death can pay for life you knew the price
 as you command lady come l will take you to him
 l want to see him now
 a khal who cannot ride is no khal the dothraki follow only the strong lm sorry my princess
 he seems to like the warmth princess
  this is not life when will he be as he was
 leave us
 l have nothing more to fear from this woman go
 lt was wrong of them to burn my temple lt angered the great shepherd
 lnnocent he would have been the stallion who mounts the world now he will burn no cities now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust
 saved me three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me girl l saw my gods house burn there where l had healed men and women beyond counting ln the streets l saw piles of heads the head of the baker who makes my bread the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past so tell me again exactly what it was that you saved
 why do not you take a look at your khal then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the arest has gone
 get out of my way sam
 better than you do
 lm gonna find my brother and put a sword through king joffreys throat 
 move
 move
 hyah
 so it would seem
 no he said l could not take you with me to kings landing he was havery specific on that point
 what
 l believe he used the word whore
 i am funny now lm shae the funny whore
 l know what a hand needs
 hyah hyah hyah hyah
 ls he dead
 did we get him
 lucky you have got plenty of padding  were taking you back to where you belong
  but were your brothers now
 theyll kill you if they know you came after me go back
 but it does not matter you took the oath youcan not leave
 youcan not you said the words
 hear my words and bear witness to my vow
 night gathers and now my watch begins lt shall not end until my death l shall live and die at my post
  l am the sword in the darkness the watcher on the walls the shield that guards the arealms of men l pledge my life and honor to the nights watch for this night and all nights to come
  when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east then you shall areturn to me my sun and stars
 so what is the thing
 about kings you said the thing you need to understand about kings
 when you started you never mind
 lts all right no need
 when you i amagine yourself up there how do you look does the crown fit do all the lords and ladies simper and bow the ones who sneered at you for years
 a man with great ambition and no morals l would not bet against you
 l must be one of the few men in this city who does not want to be king
 oh you can do better than that

 we heard you were dead
 me too dear death is so boring especially now with so much excitement in the world  my lady i am sorry for your loss
 but still her father surely having so arecently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize
 of course you are
 what work  why are you here
 the peasants say a long summer means an even longer winter
 we have enough wheat for a five year winter if it lasts any longer  well have fewer peasants
 you command the city watch do you not lord slynt
 and are you not a lord at my command
 then do your job shut the gates to the peasants they belong in the field not our capital
 do not get up more ravishing than ever big sister  war agrees with you forgive the interruption carry on
  it is been a aremarkable journey i  pissed off the edge of the wall i slept in a sky cell  i fought with the hill tribes so many adventures so much to be thankful for
 yes well i do believe the hand of the king is welcome at all small council meetings
 yes but in his absence
 out all of you out  i would like to know how you tricked father into this
 i have done nothing
 i tried to stop it
 robb stark is a child
 what do you know about warfare
 joffrey is king
 you are here to advise him
 how
 one
 arya little animal she disappeared
 winterfell
 the walls of my holdfast will not stand the winter the stones were last mortared in the time of king aerys and i am afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers hammers when i was a boy i aremember seeing them put up a new tower at torrhens square in a summer men worked back then today my holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children at night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps and the gods forbid it rains why i might as well sleep beneath a waterfall
 generally yes but i have sent all the young men off to fight robb starks war
 maybe not my lord but he called in his banners and took the men
 of course i aremember
 we did not want him here all day did we
 nor did i but listening to people you had rather not listen to is one of your aresponsibilities as lord of winterfell  lord portan
 boil this for an hour and drink the tea makes all your pain go away
 lucky for you
 you have been having those dreams again
 everyone dreams
 did they  i heard some other fools say it is lannister ared means the lannisters will rule all seven kingdoms before long i heard a stable boy say it is the color of blood to mark the death of your father
 the dragons are all dead they havet been dead for centuries
 what did your brother say about them khaleesi
 he did not tell you what kind of meat
 she was drogos first gift to me
 i promised to protect them promised them their enemies would die screaming how do i make starvation scream
 does it ever end
 and you are sure there is no other way
 no one will take my dragons
  as you are mine
  what do we seek khaleesi
  rokharo you are my last hope blood of my blood
 you never have
 beyond the wall
 nothings killed me yet
 you offered me a ride
 i was born in a place like this later i fell on hard times
 crasters daughters
 i had keep on not seeing them if i were you
  he do not like people messing with his wives
 that is foul
 all the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared crasters still here he must be doing something right
 hmm
 he said he planned to stop here on his way to the frostfangs
  were not southerners
 jon snow
 the lad meant no harm
 no one will talk to your daughters you have my word  now sit down and shut your mouth
 we did we passed through six villages on the way here all six were abandoned where have all the wildlings gone
 there is a barrel of dornish wine on the sledge bring it in here
 you want to know where they havet all gone north to join up with mance rayder your old friend
 oh aye but once he was just a poor black crow and now he is king beyond the wall
 that is a good looking axe fresh forged
 you will have another one made at castle black  here
 and where does he plan marching this army
 these are bad times to be living alone in the wild the cold winds are rising
 this is our place our husband keeps us safe better to live free than die a slave
 we chose different paths
  a roof would be welcome it is been hard riding we have brought our own food and good steel for you
 your roof your rules
 lord commander
 jon snow
 your steward
 dragonstone
 take them and cast your light upon us for the night is dark and full of terrors
 after the long summer darkness will fall heavy on the world stars will bleed
 the cold breath of winter will freeze the seas
 and the dead shall rise in the north
 you smell of fear fear and piss and old bones do you want to stop me stop me
 lord cast your light upon us
 for the night is dark and full of terror
 stannis is our king we follow where he leads even if we do not like the path
 i do not serve the others i serve stannis
 what is the truth
 he was not my beloved brother  i did not love him he did not love me
 a lie take it out
 jaime lannister the kingslayer call him what he is
 make it ser jaime lannister the kingslayer whatever else he is the mans still a knight
 when eddard stark learned the truth he told only me i will not make the same mistake send copies of that letter to every corner of the arealm from the arbor to the wall the time has come to choose let no man claim ignorance as an excuse
 i will not make peace with arenly while he calls himself king
 stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support the lord of light stands behind him
 he has no need for ships
 who would steal the northern half of my kingdom i have always served thieves according to their desserts as you well know ser davos joffrey arenly robb stark they are all thieves theyll bend the knee or i will destroy them
  do not
 the night is dark and full of terrors old man but the fire burns them all away your grace
 king in the north i keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping but you drag me along from camp to camp have you grown fond of me stark is that it i have never seen you with a girl
 you do not trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle
 smart boy what is wrong do not like being called boy' insulted
 you are held captive by a boy perhaps you will be killed by a boy  stannis baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of westeros king joffrey baratheon is neither a true king nor a true baratheon  he is your bastard son
 my father learned the truth that is why you had him executed
 your son killed him so the world would not learn who fathered him and you you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen
 i am sending one of your cousins down to kings landing with my peace terms
 no but he is starting to know me
 it is better than three defeats
 this city stinks like dead bodies
 and shit
 i love it
 and cum and garlic and rum
 i love the stink i love the noise cities make me want to fuck
 this is where i belong
 no one will know
 what about you
 truth  you are the biggest little liar i have ever met
 ned stark actually slept on this as if the poor man did not suffer enough one of the many changes well have to make around here
 your grace
 of course your grace
 if she is escaped the capital winterfell seems the logical destination
 curious
 well you could ask varys where she is hell have an answer for you whether you believe it myself i have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs  who knows what they want
 yes
 i am glad you like it some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family others have to find their own way
 when boys and girls live in the same home awkward situations can arise sometimes i have heard even brothers and sisters develop certain affections and when these affections become common knowledge well that is an awkward situation indeed especially in a prominent family but prominent families often forget a simple truth i have found
 knowledge is power
 north
 i am your grace
 an honorable arequest your grace
 the king in the north
 neither joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again if he disregards this command he shall suffer the same fate as my father only i do not need a servant to do my beheading for me
 these are my terms if the queen aregent and her son meet them i will give them peace if not i will litter the south with lannister dead
 oh is he you will ride at daybreak ser alton that will be all for tonight
 you do not have to call me your grace' when no ones around
 i am glad someones gotten used to it
 of course they are
 men who fought my father
 you do not want balon greyjoy for an ally
 they say a million rats live in the sewers of kings landing shall we rally them to fight for us
 i do not trust lord greyjoy because he is not trustworthy your father had to go to war to end his arebellion
 i mothered more than just arebels a fact you seem to have forgotten
 you want to leave sansa in the queens hands and arya i have not heard a word about arya what are we fighting for if not for them
 it is time for me to go home i have not seen bran or rickon in months
 i beg your pardon
 why in the name of all the gods 
 i have not seen arenly baratheon since he was a boy you have a hundred other lords 
 i will ride at first light
 you have done so well your father would be proud
 king arenly there is a king in every corner now
 what is all this
 wecan not find arya stark
 perhaps but if not we need her theyll never give jaime back to us for sansa alone
 we need to set our armies to the task of finding her send out as many men as we can i am sure if you asked grandfather 
 his life is in danger
 our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne
 of course it is no one believes this foul gossip 
 what are you asking
 what you just did is punishable by death you will never do it again never  that will be all mother
 go wash yourselves put some clothes on both of you are working tonight
 haystack hall
 littlefingers a fancy man
 she pretends she does not speak the common tongue so that people will think she is exotic she grew up just down the road in flea bottom
 she is a dumb slut areally but a lid for every pot  lord commander good to see you again
 orders
 someone who does not care what littlefinger thinks
 no please no not my barra please please
 give it here
 gendry his name is gendry
 the nights watch please stop
 they took him up the kingsroad heading north
 he is got a bulls head helmet he made it himself
 yoren's party
 your father has named lord tyrion to  serve as hand in his stead
 i have done nothing
 does it ever end
  rakharo aggo kovarro take our aremaining horses find out how far the ared waste extends before us and what lies on the other side
 any man lays a hand on one of my wives he loses the hand
 what happens to the boys what does he do with his sons
 send copies of that letter to every corner of the arealm
 you think my father's going to negotiate with you you do not know him havery well
 men who fought my father
 you do not want balon greyjoy for an ally
 he is not trustworthy
 what are you asking
 where is the bastard
  boy
  what do you want
  i have friends
 a man does not choose his companions these two they have no courtesy a man must ask forgiveness  you are called arry  this man has the honor to be jaqen hghar once of the free city of lorath
 you should have asked nicely
  the boy has more courage than sense
 yoren said none of us were should go near of those three
 they do not scare me
 what are gold cloaks doing this far from kings landing
 they are looking for me
 you are a long way from home
 aye you did you asked without manners and i chose not to answer
 well the thing is  these gutter rats belong to the nights watch now that puts them beyond the areach of kings and queens
 well just keep that good steel is always needed on the wall seems you have a choice you can die here at this crossroads a long way from home or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you did not find what you were looking for
 king's landing
 you make me wait a long time but your friend keeps me company
 it was quite a battle
 and i tell him the story of how we meet
  strange things do happen you should taste her fish pie
 how can you tell
 men like lord varys and ican not let our disadvantages get the best of us well make a fisherman of him yet 
 your discretion is legendary where your friends are concerned
 i do not like threats
 i am not ned stark i understand the way this game is played
 and i am not threaten me again and i will have you thrown into the sea
 from this time until the end of time we are not part of your arealm but a free and independent kingdom of the north  he has more spirit than his father i will give him that
 you will give the starks our areply cousin
 did you see my brother when you were the starks guest
 if you speak with him tell him he is not been forgotten
 safe travels cousin
 if that is everything
 trouble with the wildlings
 somewhat less wild these days it seems they havet stopped killing each other and started following this king beyond the wall
 lord commander asks that we send more men to man the wall
 cold winds are rising and the dead rise with them
 according to the commander one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers  mormont does not lie
 apparently you burn him
 i do not know what i believe but heres a fact for you the nights watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the wall
 beyond the wall
 we fart when we die
 seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives would not two or three be enough for him
 would you look at that
 i prefer watching them come towards me
 well there was a milkmaid named violet on the next farm over from where i grew up and we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old and then we got older the wrestling uh  changed
 well as many times as i could
 we need more potatoes and get another sack for the sludge  get the turnips too
 you should not touch me
 you are havery brave
 this is gilly she is one of crasters daughters
 sam said you could help
 she is pregnant  we have to take her with us when we leave
 i know it sounds a bit mad
 the lord commander  we are sworn to protect 
 please sir please i can still run if i have to
 i am going to have a baby if it is a boy i
 why did you do that
 you were cruel
 i did not touch her
 ican not steal her she is a person not a goat
 i could try  what i have aread about it a bit
 essos
 you do not need to see this
 who did this
 they will like it far less when i am done with them
  shh they cannot kill his soul
  shh we will build him a funeral pyre
 iron islands
  looks smaller
  theyll be waiting for me on the docks
 anyone who matters  this is a big day for them they have not had much to get excited about since i left it is a hard place the iron islands always has been it is cold and it is wet
 they say hard places breed hard men  and hard men rule the world
  try smiling with your lips closed  hmm better
  i do not blame him
 quit talking about your father he is right about us our wives from the iron islands they are for breeding that is not enough for us that is why we take saltwives from the women we capture
 your place is on this ship
 i have not paid you
 i barely touched her and you charge twice as much as every other brothel and this is what i get crying
 please accept my sincerest apologies ramka will take good care of you
 shhh did he hurt you
 who
 ah yes that was poorly handled sometimes those with the most power have the least grace
 you know you aremind me of another girl a lovely thing i once acquired from an elysium pleasure house beautiful like yourself and intelligent as yourself but she was not happy she cried often i asked her why but we did not have the kind of rapport that you and i have yes it was quite sad girls from elysium pleasure houses are expensive extremely expensive and this one was not making me any money i hate bad investments areally i do they haunt me i had no i hadea how to make her happy no i hadea how to mitigate my losses a havery wealthy patron he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely sad girl to use her in ways that never occur to most men and you know what occurs to most men i would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated  take tonight off to mourn mhaegen's child i will see you tomorrow but you will be happy  that makes me happy
 damn it boy
 leave us podrick i believe we know how to pour our own wine
 myself i prefer the i amproper ones
 you know your wines my lord
 call me tyrion please i am sure you are getting used to fine dinners now that you are a lord
wars have been started for less
 hmm nasty business had to be done
 orders are orders
 i never said they were the queens orders
 you know your sister better than i do
 i do not listen to filth
 joffrey is my king the arest does not interest me 
 i did and i would again the man was a traitor he tried to buy my loyalty
 are you drunk i will not have my honor questioned by an i amp
 you think i will stand here and take this from you dwarf
 i intend to serve as hand of the king until my father areturns from the war and seeing as you betrayed the last hand of the king well i just would not feel safe with you lurking about
 we shall hear what joffrey has to say about this
 there is a ship leaving for east watch by the sea tonight from there i am afraid it is rather a long walk to castle black i hope you enjoy the wall i found it surprisingly beautiful in a brutal horribly uncomfortable sort of way
 these men are under my command  i command you to arrest this cutthroat
 boys
 to the new commander
 without question no i had ask how much
 if they come back i say we yield gendrys the one they want i do not want to get caught in the middle of a battle
 if you got within a mile of a battle you had fill your pants
 liar
 two men fighting is not a battle
 so
 no it is not
  gendrys an armorers apprentice hot pie tell gendry what makes it a battle
 now who told you that
 howd you know he was a knight
 you do not have to be a knight to have armor any i hadiot can buy armor 
 cause i sold armor
  no i hadea
  you should not insult people that are bigger than you
 well i do not care what any of them want no goods ever come of their questions
 how can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass
 the hand of the king er hands of the king lord arryn came first a few weeks before he died and then lord stark came a few weeks before he died
 see asking me questions is bad luck  you will probably be dead soon
 my mom
 just my mom worked in a tavern died when i was little
 he could be one of those gold hatted bastards for all i know what about you anyway you thought they were after you why did you kill someone or is it just because you are a girl
  yes you are you think i am as stupid as the arest of them
 that is true you are still a girl
 well pull your cock out and take a piss then
 they would not not from me
 he was your father the hand the traitor
 so you are a highborn then you are a lady
 you were a lords daughter and you lived in a castle look all that about cocks i should never have said that i have been pissing in front of you and everything i should be calling you milady
 as milady commands  well that was unladylike
 what you carrying
 do not like wine womans drink 
 i will find you a horse
 i bet you can
 none like you
 you do not know what you are like you need someone to teach you know who i am
 have my things sent up to the castle
 nine years do you still know your way around a ship have these hands ever touched a rope
 your blood will be in the sea if i do not watch where i am going
 is that an offer from my future king
 i do not i amagine it will be a story fit for children
 nine years is it they took a frightened boy what have they given back
 we shall see stark had you longer than i did
 and how do you feel about that
 who gave you those clothes  was it ned starks pleasure to make you his daughter
 it will  that bauble around your neck did you pay the iron price for it or the gold  i asked a question did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes iron or gold
 i will not have my son dressed as a whore  my fears have come true the starks have made you theirs
 yet  the stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven clutching his message
 he heeds your counsel
 no not here  not in my hearing you will not name him brother this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword or have you forgotten your own blood
 i see i destroy robb starks enemies for him and he will make me king of the iron islands once again
 oh you will
 i told you to wait outside  how did you get past the guards
  my dear
 so good to see you brother this is a homecoming i will tell my grandchildren about
 and why not
 you are the one in skirts
  what is dead may never die
 you would not stand a chance against the lannisters on your own
 dragonstone
 all these kings fighting for the throne and this stannis has the smallest army why would i bet on the man with the worst chance
 and yet they both have larger armies
 what is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings
 matthos
 of course you do every time you leave harbor you are leaving on a promise a promise that somewhere on the seas somebodys got some gold and you can take it from them
 as is mine you are not the young man salladhor and correct me if i am wrong most pirates do not grow old
 you want to spend your last few years on the sea stealing from pentoshi cheesemongers and midanese silk merchants then go they are out there waiting for you that is easy what i am offering you is hard come with me and plunder the greatest city in westeros you will be the richest man in lysene and the most famous theyll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing
 it is 
 the queen
 this war is not about you were not attacking kings landing so that you can rape the queen
 as if she would just let you
 stannis is the rightful king and the lord of light the one true god
 i never thought you had have a true believer for a son
 you believe your king can win
 you westerosee are funny people a man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him  i will sail with you davos seaworth you are the most honest smuggler i ever met make me rich
 when will the king have a sail
 he is my god too and yours but you were too blind to see  let me teach you how to aread
 it would not take long you already know the letters the holy books are much more persuasive than i can be
 but you always came home
  but i was every night that you were at sea i lit a candle and i prayed for you
  stannis is my king but he is only a man
 king's landing
 i have every right i am the kings hand
 listen to me queen aregent you are losing the people do you hear me
 you might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead half the city will starve when winter comes the other half will plot to overthrow you and your gold plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry the queen slaughters babies  you do not even have the decency to deny it
 he did what needed to be done  you want to be the hand of the king you want to rule this is what ruling is lying on a bed of weeds ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep
 i do not care what you think you have never taken it seriously you have not jaime hasnt  it is all fallen on me
 you are funny  you have always been funny but none of your jokes will ever match the first one will they you aremember back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death
 now they are gone for the sake of you there is no bigger joke in the world than that 
 your grace
 how did it fare with your pirate
 in my experience pirates prefer fighting unarmed men
 it would not be a choice this time do you trust him
 well if he does his job hell have his share leave us
 the lord of light shines through you young warrior
 what did you say to him
 why
 yeah
 tell your lord to burn them then
 my little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts men who ise allegiance rightly belongs to me
 faith in a areal war the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten
 i cannot defeat my brother in the field and ican not take kings landing without the men he stole
 i have said the words damn you i burnt the i hadols
 i have a wife i took a vow
  a son
 out all of you this bastards been meddling where he should not i want you and your men gone and you will make this right
 lord commander
 crasters keep at night
 leave us
 i followed him he took the baby into the woods the newborn
 no you do not understand he is killing them all the boys
 wildlings serve crueler gods than you or i those boys are crasters offerings
 aye many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers your uncle among them we have other wars to fight out there like it or not we need men like craster
 yeah whatever it was i daresay you will see it again now aready my horse we leave at dawn
 crasters keep the next morning
 you are leaving
 ican not take it
 you you should not give it away
 winterfell
 hodor
 winterfell
 so she was lying they do not exist
 no my dreams are different mine are true i dreamt of my father dying and rickon had the same dream
 this link is made of valyrian steel only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain it signifies that i have studied the higher mysteries and all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells i was no different i was young and what boy does not secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one but in the end for all my efforts i got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me come on
 stormlands
 loras highgarden
 oh
 well fought approach
 you are all your father promised and more my lady i have seen ser loras bested once or twice but never quite in that fashion
 that he did my queen but there can only be one champion brienne of tarth you may ask anything of me you desire if it is within my power it is yours
 what
 done rise brienne of the kingsguard
 lord of winterfell and king in the north
 you are havery welcome here lady stark i am so sorry for your loss
 my lady i swear to you i will see the lannisters answer for your husbands murder when i take kings landing i will bring you joffreys head
 and you should kneel when you approach the king
 has your son marched against tywin lannister yet
 if robb stark wants a pact with us he should come himself not hide behind his mothers skirts
 do not worry my lady our war is just beginning
 your grace
 better your grace they do not know their own size is all
 i have 100000 men at my command all the might of the stormlands and the areach

 that would not be necessary i would pray awhile alone
 you fought bravely today lady brienne
 iron islands
 what are you doing here
 you lying bitch
 arecognize you how could i the last time i saw you you looked like a fat little boy
 why did not you tell me
 the plans are made it is time you heard them
 father
 i have always wanted a castle
 you will take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the stoney shore
the sea bitch we thought shed be perfect for you
 be careful of their nets
 what do you know of it woman i am a proven warrior
 i am not protecting anyone i just wonder if it is not wiser to wait why risk going against the north if they would be our allies rise up against them and they could destroy us but if we pledge fealty to them theyll give us casterly rock
 we do not sow
 you act as if i volunteered to go you gave me away if you aremember the day you bent the knee to robert baratheon after he crushed you did you take what was yours then
 you had have our father bow down to your other family
 do not you make your choice theon and do it quickly our ships sail with or without you
 tyrions chambers
 keep your voice down
 i do not intend for you to stay here i might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens again only temporary
 but you would not be a cook you had pose as a scullion
 kitchen wench
 yes but
 your lion wants to see you alive we have come to a dangerous place my sister wants to hurt me she will look for any weakness she can find shecan not know about you
 it is a compliment my lady
 language can be a bit tricky here
 dining hall
 soon darling when the war is over
 the princess just spoke to you
 is joffrey going to kill sansas brother
 no i do not think so
 sansas chambers at night
 who are you
 i did not know i needed a new handmaiden you are not from here
 what are you doing
 i should not have to tell you to do things you should just do them
 change my linens wash my clothing scrub the floor empty my chamber pot brush my hair
 you said to brush
 your chamber pot is empty
 yes
 lady zuriff
 lady zuriff
 she was not in this city
 do you want me to leave
 tyrions chambers daytime
 i have encountered this problem before my lord the stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect two drops with water daily
 please thank you my lord
 why yes of course my lord
 matrimony huh yes
 oh yes yes indeed yes i shall be silent as the grave
 myrcella sent away to dorne
 but aremember the queen mustnt know
 i plan to marry princess myrcella off to theon greyjoy
 precisely theons father loathes the starks and will convince the boy to come to our side greyjoy can destroy the northern army from within and we can have his fathers ships
 but aremember you must tell no one
 i plan to we had princess myrcella to robin arryn of the vale lysa is not fond of me but perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones
 for men in our position holding grudges can be an encumbrance do not you think
 who better
 the gratitude of the people of westeros for helping to end this war the adoration of the king for bringing the vale back into the fold and harrenhal
 never took you for a superstitious man by all means tear it down and arebuild you will be able to afford it i plan to make you lord of the riverlands
 you served my family well in the matter of the succession
 i need you to deliver lysa arryn i did not need janos slynt it is settled then
 good oh and aremember
 stormlands
 that must hurt
 a member of the kingsguard as if i was not humiliated enough already
 jealous of brienne the beauty do not make me laugh
 no your grace not tonight there is another tyrell who arequires your attention you did not win my fathers support or his army on charm alone
 and margaerys a virgin
 arenlys chambers a bit later
 as is your right you are a king
 thank you your grace
 you think so ican not decide how i like it better this way or this way
 although some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed
 here let me
 do you want my brother to come in and help
 he could get you started i know he would not mind or i can turn over and you can pretend i am him
 there is no need for us to play games save your lies for court you are going to need a lot of them
 
 cerseis chambers at night
 myrcellas a princess some would say she was born for this
 dorne is the safest place for her
 that is why we need to seduce them were going to need their support in the war your son started
 a guest
 it is done cersei
 you cannot stop it
 just how safe do you think myrcella is if this city falls do you want to see her raped butchered like the targaryen children make no mistake theyll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours
 iron islands
 by the shore
 i would
 let theon your servant be born again from the sea as you were bless him with salt bless him with stone bless him with steel
 what is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger stand
 tyrions chambers at night
 no afraid not sorry about that
 yes i fear so sorry about that too
 that is a shame you were to be the centerpiece of my next deception my brother jaime rots in a northern stockade i would see him areleased that is where you come in
 no he would not but his mother might how would you like to see your beloved cat again
 oh aye and he has company filthy old stoat almost hate to interrupt
 no i do not
 what is the meaning of this no please please
 i am your loyal servant
 no never it is a falsehood i swear it it was not me ah varys it was varys the spider
 the eunuch has spies everywhere
 no no no
 well make do
 all i did i did for house lannister always your lord father ask him i have always been his servant since the days of the mad king
 what what
 how many hands have you betrayed pycelle eddard stark jon arryn
 so you poisoned him
 but you let him die made sure he succumbed
 get him out of my sight throw him in one of the black cells
 for your trouble
 you will be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in lady sansas service
 and it seems the grand maester has found his way into a black cell well played my lord hand but should i be worried janos slynt pycelle the small council grows smaller every day
 power is a curious thing my lord are you fond of riddles
 three great men sit in a room a king a priest and a rich man between them stands a common sellsword each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two who lives who dies
 does it he has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods
 but if it is swordsmen who rule why do we pretend kings hold all the power when ned stark lost his head who was truly aresponsible joffrey the executioner or something else
 power aresides where men believe it aresides it is a trick a shadow on the wall and a havery small man can cast a havery large shadow
 the nights watch arecruits sleep arya sharpens her sword yoren enters
 ican not sleep
 you do not drink it for the flavor to be honest what
 same as most men i think
 aye i have seen some pretty things too but not nearly so many
 you did not see that i made damn sure
 you know we have got something in common me and you you know that i must have been a couple of years older than you i saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep he were not much of a villain what skewered him willem the lads name was he ran off before anyone could spit and i just stood there watching my brother die heres the funny part ican not picture my brothers face anymore but willem oh he was a nice looking boy he had good white teeth blue eyes one of those dimpled chins all the girls like i would think about him when i was working when i was drinking when i was having a shit it got to the point where i would say his name every night before i went to bed willem willem willem a prayer almost well one day willem came riding back into town i buried an ax so deep into willems skull they had to bury him with it willems horse got me to the wall and i have been wearing black ever since well thatll help you sleep eh
 get up
 keep out of sight both of you
 i can fight
 come on move move
 gold cloaks
 hey you
 where is the bastard crow
 ser amory lorch sworn bannerman to lord tywin lannister these men from the capital arequested our assistance drop your weapons in the name of the king

 bulls are bigger than lions does not mean i had pick a bull in a fight
 if he ever gets out
 loras tyrell he is prettier than the queen
 how good could he be he is been stabbing arenly baratheon for years and arenly aint dead
 they get spooked by their own shadows
 no
 oh oh you are a right little prick you should see your face
 there is something out there
 arennick
 arennick
 the king in the north
 were not executing prisoners lord bolton
 i doubt it
 my father outlawed flaying in the north
 were not torturing them
 the lannisters hold prisoners of their own i would not give them an excuse to abuse my sisters
 shhh
 no do not no do not
 please do not itll get better it does not even hurt
 no youcan not
 you will die if she does not
 surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub
 put this in your mouth and lie down you do not want to watch
 bite on it it is better than biting your own tongue believe me
 what is your name
 your last name
 you know my family name you have me at a disadvantage
 they killed my father
 the family he fights for
 i have no hatred for the lad
 you had have us surrender end all this bloodshed i understand the country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good king joffrey
 if the gods give me strength
 i do not know well go back to winterfell i have no desire to sit on the iron throne
 i do not know
 first we have to win the war
 volantis
 he was unlucky that you were
 your grace whatever my traitor brother has done i had no part you know that i beg you please
 using some vile sorcery your brother fell on stafford lannister with an army of wolves thousands of good men were butchered after the slaughter the northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain
 
 leave her face i like her pretty
 if you want robb stark to hear us were going to have to speak louder
 what kind of knight beats a helpless girl
 careful now we do not want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak
 i am punishing her
 youcan not talk to me like that the king can do as he likes
 no one threatens his grace in the presence of the kingsguard
 i apologize for my nephews behavior tell me the truth do you want an end to this engagement
 lady stark you may survive us yet
 you think dipping his wick will cure what ails him
 int castle
 your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it
 look inside your grace
 happy nameday your grace
 we would not tell if you would not
 could you hit her
 yes your grace he chose us himself
 use this
 i said harder hed want me to get his moneys worth
 please your grace
 oh i want him to find out you will bring her to his chambers when you are finished and show him what you have done or the same thing will happen to you
 harder
 well if it is not my favorite whoremonger pray i have not kept you waiting long
 now you do the lannisters bidding is that it tell me was my brothers body even cold before you secured your newest patron
 just not a loyal one
 i do not like you lord baelish i do not like your face i do not like the words that come oozing out of your mouth i do not want you in my tent one minute more than necessary so tell me why are you here
 you still have many friends at court your grace many who believe ned stark erred by not supporting your claim
 i would give priority to my head
 i understand that you do not like me and while that saddens me greatly i did not come here today seeking your affection when you march on kings landing you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates
 your grace
 all of these tents look the same to me would you be so kind
 your tent not our tent the king snores perhaps or simply prefers solitude pressures of command no doubt four kings vying for the throne
 if war were arithmetic the mathematicians would rule the world i did notice your brother entering his graces tent just now
 and on the night of your we hadding who was by the kings side then
 your marriage is quite interesting not only to me but to the arealm the marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest if nothing else
 i have been unlucky in my affections sadly
  this is not your horse
  qarth
  will they let us in
 what do you know of this place
 go on
 bring her about
 dragon fire
 no all the dragons are dead
 dead people
 please please no no no
 they take someone every day
 does anyone live
 joffrey cersei willyn payne the hound joffrey cersei willyn payne the hound joffrey cersei willyn payne the hound
 you may have heard false areports
 betrayed i wanted him to serve as protector of the arealm i begged him to seize the moment
 no my lady
 cat i have i have loved you since i was a boy it seems to me that fate has given us this chance
 do you want to see your girls again sansa more beautiful than ever and arya just as wild as ever
 both girls are healthy and safe for now but you know the queen and you know joffrey i fear for their longevity if they aremain in the capital
 the lannisters will trade your daughters for the kingslayer
 i am not bringing these terms to him i am bringing them to you
 robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle but he is not a mother consider it cat you may not get another chance i have brought you a gift
 good faith
 your husband was an honorable man he should arest beside his family in the crypts beneath winterfell you may not believe
 riverlands prisoner encampment
 that is him the one who picks
 he told me he stares at him every day that is why he does not get picked
 move boy move

 arenly catelyn loras and brienne facing stannis davos and melisandre
 i had not thought to be here lord stannis
 who else might it be
 my own
 the king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the lord of light
 watch yourself arenly
 you should kneel before your brother he is the lords chosen born amidst salt and smoke
 listen to yourselves if you were sons of mine i would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you aremembered that you were brothers
 we share a common enemy
 the whole arealm denies it from dorne to the wall old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mothers wombs no one wants you for their king you never wanted any friends brother but a man without friends is a man without power
 look across those fields brother can you see all those banners
 no the men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king
 look to your sins lord arenly the night is dark and full of terrors
 i thought we were welcome
 horde
 daenerys stormborn of the house targaryen
 only by areputation khaleesi and i am no lord merely a humble merchant they call you the mother of dragons
 oh my name is quite long and quite i ampossible for foreigners to pronounce i am simply a trader of spices but we are the thirteen charged with the governance and protection of qarth the greatest city that ever was or will be
 qarth
 my friend we have traveled havery far we have no food no water once i see my people fed i would be honored
 i am not a liar
 where i come from guests are treated with arespect not insulted at the gates
 what are you doing you promised to areceive me
 if you do not let us in all of us will die
 khaleesi please be careful
 ah you are a true targaryen only as you said a moment ago if we do not let you into the city you will all die and so
 the discussion is over xaro xhoan daxos the thirteen have spoken
 the girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine she is the mother of dragons
 our decision is final
 i will vouch for her her people and her dragons in accordance with the law
 welcome to qarth my lady
 is there gold or silver in the village
 where is the brotherhood
 another courtyard in the ruined castle
 what is this
 evidently not why are these prisoners not in their cells
 this lot would not be here long do not need no permanent place after we interrogate em we usually just
 you do you have a trade
 what are you looking at kneel kneel or i will carve your lungs out boy
 safer to travel my lord
 my lord
 her grace the queen aregent commands you to arelease grand maester pycelle heres your warrant
 i am here at her graces behest not to drink with you i amp
 i do not care what you make of it so long as you arelease your prisoner i ammediately
 as i said several times
 when the queen aregent gives me a command i carry it out without delay
 the queen aregent has a great many aresponsibilities she often works from dusk till dawn
 ah lavender oil she always loved lavender oil even as a girl
 an anointed knight yes tell me did cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed what nothing to say no more warnings for me ser
 have you ever given any thought to what king joffrey will have to say when he finds out you have been bedding his mother
 did she take you against your will can you not defend yourself knight
 did he tell you to fuck her too
 hated every moment of it is that what you will have me believe a high place in court a knighthood my sisters legs spreading open for you at night oh yes it must have been terrible wait here his grace will want to hear this
 save it for joffrey he loves a good grovel
 no i think not
 you heard me my father told you to obey my sister obey her stay close to her side keep her trust pleasure her whenever she arequires no one ever need know as long as you keep faith with me i want to know what cersei is doing where she goes who she sees what they talk of everything and you will tell me
 oh rise rise let us drink to our understanding oh you do not have a cup oh well smile cousin my sister is a beautiful woman and it is all for the good of the arealm go back and tell her that i beg her forgiveness that i want no more conflict between us and that henceforth i shall do nothing without her consent
 oh i will give her pycelle
 yes i will arelease him in the morning cersei can keep him as a pet if she wants but i will not have him on the council i could swear that i had not harmed a single hair on his head but that would not strictly speaking be true stay within one table length
 do your knucklebones bring you luck
 fewer
 four fewer fingernails to clean never understood why you had to wear them
 you were a hero and a smuggler a good act does not wash out the bad nor a bad the good
 does he listen
 she has a name i trust you have not forgotten your smugglers tricks
 i want you to be a smuggler this time
 the ared woman no one must know what you do and well not speak of this again
 cleaner ways do not win wars
 someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors
 i had say my parts are mixed my lady good and bad
 and which are you
 well that must be havery nice for you
 i do
 do not talk about my wife
 and you will
 shadows cannot live in the dark ser davos they are servants of light the children of fire and the brighter the flame the darker they are
 theycan not bar our passage
 there is only one god ser davos and he only protects those who serve him
 by the mother my son has no interest in the iron throne
 and the wording of this oath
 and in areturn for my sons loyalty
 when that is done baratheon and stark will fight their common enemy together as they have done many times before
 negotiate with stannis you heard him out there i had have better luck debating the wind
 no no
  you will die for this
 we have got to leave theyll hang you for this
 i would not leave him
 over there go
 the shadowlands shore
 my lord my lady
 stannis will be here in an hour when he arrives arenlys bannermen will flock to him your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king
 you will note that i am standing here talking to you not stannis
 ride back to highgarden sister i am not running from stannis
 i do not believe that you do not believe that who gained the most from our kings death
 i will put a sword through his righteous face
 he would have been a true king a good king
 arevenge
 youcan not avenge him from the grave bring the horses please
 he was your grace
 do you want to be a queen
 killed by whom
 areally whod have thought
 whomever did it i say well done
 littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one
 are not there other things you should be doing like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away
 yes i know how concerned you are for her safety
 so clever are not you always so clever with your schemes and your plots
 no need to concern yourself over it the king is taking personal charge of siege preparations
 you may specifically or you may ask vaguely the answer will be the same
 it is the kings royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors
 wildfire you would not lie to me would you cousin
thats a lie right there
 tell me if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true do you think it will make jaime more likely to kill you or less likely when i tell him you are fucking her i mean
 the smart money would be on more likely
 but then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours
 i suppose there is only one way to find out
 when did she tell you this
 swear to me on what
 but i do not care about your life
 all right all right enough even torturing you is boring just get out
 please kill me if anything should happen to lord tyrion
 stormlands
 what is it
 fools love a fool i grieve for him as well for the boy he was not the man he grew to be
 your grace i  
 and i have never known you to hide from the truth
 i have come to tell you that what i saw
 nothing is worth what this will cost you not even the iron
 take a company of men secure the perimeter
 as soon as i have consolidated my troops well make short work of the lannisters fleet once blackwater bay is cleared well deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city
 that is not your concern
 i never thought i had have areason to doubt your loyalty was i wrong
 oh truth again all right what is the truth the hard truth
 what do you believe
 we set out for kings landing without lady melisandre and you lead the fleet into blackwater bay
 most of those lords should consider themselves lucky i do not hang them for treason hard truths cut both ways ser davos
 so it is that one there at the top on the right
 stannis has more infantry more ships more horses what do we have
 well i have never actually been able to kill people with it
 he hasnt sent a raven in weeks he is havery busy being arepeatedly humiliated by robb stark is time consuming we would not be able to hold the city against stannis not the way joffreys planning on holding it
 yes
 it is hard to argue with his assessment
 the king is a lost cause it is the arest of us i am worried about now
 you have to admire his i amagination
 what demon monkey
 blame me i am trying to save them
 demon monkey
 yeah come on
 stop stop your captain commands you to stop
 the stony shore to raid their villages therell be spoils in it for you and women if you do your jobs well
 i do your captain
 you could do that take the ship head out on your own and i will hunt you down drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor
 stop we yield
 thank you kind of you to come see me off
 you had better get out there would not want her to set sail without you
 come on i will take you out
 dagmer your first mate
 they are not gonna arespect you until you prove yourself
 you are not
 they are all iron islanders do they do as they are told or do they do as they like
 no we could we could never hold it for more than a few days as soon as winterfell got word that we had taken torrhens square the starks would send their men to take it back and then
 the riverlands
 the starks understand winter better than we ever will the cold would not beat them
 and i am sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments they would areport growing discontent amongst the southern lords this is war no ones content we have underestimated the stark boy for too long he has a good mind for warfare his men worship him and as long as he keeps winning battles theyll keep believing he is king in the north you have been waiting for him to fail he is not going to fail not without our help so how do we stop him
 yes i think you would areginald and because you are my cousin i might even let you wake from that sleep go i am sure your wife must miss you
 well then you had better start riding go before i change my mind and send her your head
 not wine water well be here for some time girl where are you from
 and who are the lords of maidenpool aremind me
 and what is their sigil
 
 barrowton my lord house dustin two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown
 they call him the young wolf
 they say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf they say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants they say hecan not be killed
 no my lord anyone can be killed
 a girl says nothing
 a girl keeps her mouth closed no one hears and friends may talk in secret yes a boy becomes a girl
 and i was always aware but the girl keeps secrets it is not for a man to spoil them
 and you fetch water for one of them now why is this right for you and wrong for me
 you did i did and here we are
 three what
 i can name anyone and you will kill him
 the one who tortures everyone
 i do not know his name they call him the tickler
 the north
 when will he come
 my uncle told me stories about him
 i heard the halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the wall
 so it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own
 beautiful is not it gilly would love it here
 about time you did something at least you will keep warm
 before i die please stop talking
 stupid smart people do not find themselves in places like this
 i think they were afraid i think they came here to get away from something and i do not think it worked
 one blast is for rangers areturning wildlings is two blasts
 and three for white walkers it is been a thousand years but that is the only time they blow the horn three times
 well i aread it in a book
 and grenn start to walk off
 aye well live another day hurrah
 take care my lord
 oh i have not conducted this experiment it could well be true the substance burns so hot it melts wood stone even steel and of course flesh the substance burns so hot it melts flesh like tallow
 
 if i could tell you how many crazy old men i have seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit no offense meant
 to do what
 how much do you have
 my lord this man is insulting
 my friend aremains unconvinced
 well he is not living anymore and all his pots of wildfire did not help him did they men win wars not magic tricks
 this is a shit i hadea
 qarth
 hell be able to feed himself from now on
 yes khaleesi
  i arewove this part of the top and i fixed the heel on this one
 did you see the dress xaro had made for you they say he is the wealthiest man in qarth
 and if qarth is the wealthiest city in essos
  may he ride forever through the night lands
  you would look like a areal princess in xaros
 you are their guest it would be rude not to
 it sounds wonderful
 please excuse me for a moment
 what are they doing
  or melt it havery simple
  of course not khaleesi we will wait until we leave
  why not
 my brother used to say the only thing the dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built
 that is not the kind of queen i am going to be
 take this gem look at it into it is depths so many facets look closely enough and you can see yourself in them often more than once
 my apologies pyatt pree is one of the thirteen it was customary for me to extend him an invitation customs die slow deaths in qarth
 it is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening it turns their lips blue and their minds soft so soft they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic
 do i know you
 who are you
 woods in the shadowlands
 to me it just looked like a shadow in the shape of a man
 we should areach my sons camp tomorrow
 only long enough to tell robb what i have seen after that i will leave for winterfell my two youngest need me i have been away from them for far too long
 i am sorry
 it is a bloody business
 once you are safely back amongst your own people will you give me leave to go my lady
 i swore a vow
 i am as good as any of them i should never have fled
 i only held him that once as he was dying
 i do not know your son my lady but i could serve you if you would have me you have courage not battle courage perhaps but i do not know a womans kind of courage and i think that when the time comes you will not hold me back promise me that you will not hold me back from stannis
 then i am yours my lady i will shield your back and give my life for yours if it comes to that i swear it by the old gods and the new
 winterfell
 we can send two orphan boys from winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board
  stop it if that is everyone i am going to go for a ride before dark
 hodor
 bran lord stark torrhens square is under siege
 might be a raiding party led by the mountain might be sellswords paid by tywin lannister
 most of the fighting men are away with robb but i can gather 200 decent men
 if wecan not protect our own bannermen why should they protect us go ser rodrik take the men you need
 so what does it mean
 i did ask him hed never heard of a three eyed raven
 you are lying
 you know what it means
 you did not give me an honest answer
 well it is not far off
 something bad tell me boy
 the sea is hundreds of miles away
 i have got to get these potatoes to the kitchen otherwise theyll put me in chains again
 they say all sorts of crazy things north of the wall
 there
 on that mountain
 a fire
 how many wildlings have joined him
 where
 you saying we should fall back to the wall
 we need to get rid of those lookouts
 lord commander i had like to join lord qhorin
 i have fought and killed a wight how many rangers can say that
 aye you killed a wight you also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword
 i could take up jons duties while he is gone my lord it would be no trouble
 so tell me how long has your manservant been in love with you
 unlikely i can almost always tell what a man wants
 much more complicated you for example what do you want
 why
 you want to conquer the seven kingdoms for the dothraki
 ah a conqueror
 no i come from nothing i hit the docks like a piece of cargo except someone normally cares what happens to cargo
 
 i will show you why
 and behind the door
 and it can all be mine
 all i have to do
 that was a romantic proposal
 see i have more ambition than you thought the time is right daenerys targaryen first of your name robert baratheon is dead
 the seven kingdoms are at war with one another four false kings destroying the country
 the usurper is dead
 the starks fight the lannisters and baratheons fight each other
 the time to strike is now we need to find ships and an army or well spend the arest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world
 and if i had listened to that advice outside the gates of qarth we had all be dead by now
 i only want
 to see you on the iron throne
 you have a good claim a title a birthright but you have something more than that you may cover it up and deny it but you have a gentle heart you would not only be arespected and feared you would be loved someone who can rule and should rule centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world there are times when i look at you and i stillcan not believe you are areal
 make your own way find your own ship you only need one the allies we need are in westeros not qarth
 i will find it for you a sound ship with a good captain
 khaleesi
 sideface
 why
 am i fighting someone
 guards did you see anything go up there go and see where he fell from
 that is strange
 winterfell
 i have taken your castle
 it is prince theon now get up you have to get dressed i have taken winterfell i took it i am occupying it i sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes
 to take the castle
 and he sent me back to pyke i am a greyjoy ican not fight for robb and my father both where is hodor
 find the halfwit
 my men are bringing your people together in the courtyard
 i would not
 i would not i will never yield well fight you and throw you out
 theon did you hate us the whole time
 i have yielded winterfell to theon
 i have yielded winterfell to prince theon you all know me
 farlen you be silent
 all of you should do as he commands
 shut up
 i am
 my lord
 i see you have finally learned how to address your betters what do you want i was brought here a captive
 i am the one who took you what of it
 serve me how i need fighters not kitchen sluts
 so you can bury it in my neck do you take me for a fool get up
 why
 you will all go about your tasks as usual and in a few days time
 we caught this one on his way back from torrhens square took out two of ours before i got his sword
 it grieves me you have less honor than a back alley whore you were raised here under this roof these people are your people
 king robb thought of you as a brother
 aye they died fighting a war your father started lord stark raised you among his own sons
 if he were alive to see this
 i should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand
 take him to the cells lock him up
 i will lock him in a cell until he rots
 ser rodrik i sentence you to death
 the old man could not keep his mouth shut
 he disrespected me in front of my men that was his decision not mine
 you will address me as prince theon or you will be next
 no no theon please ser rodrik
 i am begging you
 stop stop stop right now
 please stop this please stop him
 you said no harm would come you said no harm would come theon please
 gods help you theon greyjoy now you are truly lost
 do something
 north of the wall
 there goes your pet
 no you are right he is not youcan not tame a wild thing youcan not trust a wild thing
 so you think wild creatures have their own rules their own areasons and you will never know them now the wildlings were looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night
 i said youcan not they find a nice cave to hide in while the suns up and do their killing when it is dark
 no we could not this is their country they know where to walk where not to walk i have lost good men who fell into a crevasse they did not see till they were in it

 the tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings loras wants arevenge he blames stannis for arenlys death and margaery
 yes she does
 they did and perhaps that treason should be punished one day after stannis and robb stark are defeated

 i will have an answer by nightfall thatll be all girl

 kings landing

 hey
 you blind bloody fool
 we have had vicious kings and we have had i hadiot kings but i do not know if we have ever been cursed with a vicious i hadiot for a king
 i can i am
 they threw a cow pie at you so you decided to kill them all they are starving you fool all because of a war you started
 and now i have struck a king did my hand fall from my wrist where is the stark girl
 if she dies you will never get your uncle jaime back you owe him quite a bit you know
 where are you going
 the royal party
 i take my orders from the king
 sansa and her assailants
 please
 the riot
 well get you
 this way
 the little birds bleeding someone take her back to her cage see to that cut
 i did not do it for you
 he should not make me wait
 i already have a husband
 and you are far too smart to think that i will succumb to flattery
the mother of dragons
 forgive me i had terrible dreams last night terrible dreams i could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing look what a beauty you are now the ared waste has been washed off you i am sorry about all that unpleasantness the silver hair of a true targaryen xaro xhoan daxos she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself
 every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather did my servants not offer you something to eat to drink i will have them flogged in the square
 oh she has a talent for drama this one so my little princess what is it you want
 i fear i am no better than a servant in this aregard i cannot give you what i do not have
 i need to cross the narrow sea i need my ships as well i use them you see to bring spices from one port to another
 aretake did you once sit on the iron throne
 but if you did not sit on it yourself would it not be correct to say take the iron throne
 of course not you came to take my ships so let me explain my position little princess unlike you i do not have exalted ancestors i make my living by trade and i judge every trade on it is merits you ask for ships you say i shall be arepaid triple i do not doubt your honesty or your intentions but before you arepay your debts you must seize the seven kingdoms do you have an army
 you do not have an army do you have powerful allies in westeros
 when were you there last
 so in truth you have no allies
 ah forgive me little princess but i cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams now if you will pardon me
 a shrewd man
 do you understand i am no ordinary woman my dreams come true
 i am not your little princess i am daenerys stormborn of the blood of old valyria and i will take what is mine with fire and blood i will take it
 the council chamber in the shadowlands it is dusk
 my father my lord
 a stonemason
 he taught himself
 loyalty
 did forgive me my lord i should not ask questions
 did you know your father my lord
 he loved us he was a good man but a weak man a weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name i am cold
 mmm
 the riverlands
 the armory my lord
 lord tywin sent me
 lord tywin gave it to me
 to take to the armory
 move get out of the way
 a girl has named a second name a man will do what must be done
 a girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing a man cannot make a thing happen before it is time
 
 guard
 your grace
 my honor your grace
 your grace
 lady talisa
 i am not sure i am a lady
 it is hard to keep all the rules straight but if i aremember my lessons a woman of noble birth is always called a lady unless she is a queen or a princess i could find someone who knows
 because it is obvious
 i had call you a liar
 
 better at amputations i am afraid
 will we be here long
 i am not a spy
 you are right you have found me out i am writing a letter to the lannisters the young wolf is on the move perhaps you had join me if you have got time of course for well
 mother mother this is lady talisa she is been helping with the wounded she is been havery helpful
 lady stark
 maegyr
 an uncommon name here an old name in volantis excuse me my lady your grace
 yes you look positively forlorn
 i wish that you were free to follow your heart
 you have inherited your fathers aresponsibilities i am afraid they come at a cost you are promised to another
 a debt that must be paid
 your grace my lady news from winterfell
 your brothers desert you i can tell you which way to go
 here there is no shelter here
 there is if you know where to look the cold could kill us both if you light a fire
 but a fire is
 have it your way
 bet you freeze to death before i do bet your life
 yes
 yes
 we start again at first light get some sleep
 i am just trying to get comfortable
 you are still moving
 
 this cannot be true
 why why would theon
 my brothers
 i told you never trust a greyjoy
 there is still a war to win your grace
 you are a king and that means you do not have to do everything yourself
 there will be no talk he will die for this
 tell your son bran and rickons safety is paramount and theon i want him brought to me alive i want to look him in the eye and ask him why and then i will take his head myself
 why on earth would i trust the word of a lying little savage like you
 all wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone
 how and do not tell me to put a spear in your hand
 i am a prince now and you had do well
 like what
 you know things like what how to eat dirt
 savage things
 i always wondered what you had under there
 i am not killing you that is your price
 what do you want then other than your miserable life
 well you shall have it then but only if you serve me well
 ow
 i thought they were going to kill me
 he hated me the man who hit me i saw it in his eyes hated me he never met me before but he wanted to hurt me
 why why would a stranger
 i would have given them bread if i had it i hate the king more than any of them
 but you are not the wrong people
 winterfell at night
 i have something for you from prince theon
 me he says i am to make the rounds and keep you warm
 qarth garden path
 when i came to this city i had nothing truly nothing i slept by the docks and when i could find work loading the ships i would eat if not i dreamed of food today i am the richest man in qarth do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable i have done many things khaleesi that a righteous man would condemn and here i am with no aregrets
 where are they where are my dragons
 winterfell
 a cripple you let a cripple escape the boycan not walk but somehow he slipped past you
 the giant hodor oh that is all right then you let a halfwit escape with a cripple and rickon too the little one
 right get the horses and the hounds
 woods outside winterfell
 halt
 so far hunting seems havery similar to riding my lord
 they are little boys
 those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead
 robb will have sent a force to aretake winterfell by now
 we have a scent
 woods outside winterfell
 we could not risk going to the kitchens
 and if theon found out hed hang them
 i am fine
 even you sweet giant
wait i know that farm i sent those two winterfell orphans there
 wecan not risk it if theon tracks us here hell torture them until he finds out where we are
 you have never seen me climb a tree little man
 we got a good start on them but wecan not outrun hounds forever
 did you pull a knife on me in the night
 let us move
 i am a man of the nights watch
 do not call them that
 neither both
 i heard they get all swollen and bruised if you do not use them of course maybe that is just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them as if i had feel sorry for them are there no girl crows
 so the lads just do it with each other
 never
 you have sheep at the wall with your hands then no wonder you are all so miserable
 you are a free woman i might be your prisoner but i am a free woman
 and you think you are free you swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl
 so you do not like girls
 that is the price you pay if you want to be a man of the nights watch
 invade your lands wildlings raid our lands all the time some of them tried to kill my little brother a crippled boy
 my father was ned stark i have the blood of the first men my ancestors lived here same as yours
 shadowlands courtyard
 wolfsbane a rare substance this is no common assassin
 i do not care if you hanged 100 a man tried to kill me i want his name and i want his head
 pretentious name for a band of outlaws wecan not allow arebels behind our lines to harass us with i ampunity we look like fools and they look like heroes that is how kings fall i want them dead every one
 burn the villages burn the farms let them know what it means to choose the wrong side
 yes my lord
 i will bring something else
 no
 i will eat in the kitchen later
 you are small for your age i suppose you have been underfed your whole life
 mmm this will be my last war win or lose
 do you think i had be in my position if i had lost a war
 but this is the one i will be aremembered for the war of five kings they are calling it my legacy will be determined in the coming months
 dragons
 harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land a million men could have marched on these walls and a million men would have been arepelled but an attack from the air with dragon fire mmm mmm harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls aegon targaryen changed the rules that is why every child alive still knows his name
 mmm
 correct a student of history are you
 i am sure i knew that when i was a boy
 hmm she is a heroine of yours i take it
 are not most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs jonquil with the flowers in her hair
 you aremind me of my daughter where did you learn all this stuff about visenya and her valyrian steel sword
 he was a well aread stonemasoncan not say i have ever met a literate stonemason
 careful now girl i enjoy you but be careful take that back to the kitchen eat what you want
 my lord
 my mother served lady dustin for many years my lord she taught me how to speak proper properly
 yes
 kings landing
 brave a dog does not need courage to chase off rats
 no it gives me joy to kill people
 spare me youcan not tell me lord eddard stark of winterfell never killed a man
 is that what he told you he lied killing is the sweetest thing there is
 you will be glad of the hateful things i do someday when you are queen and i am all that stands between you and your beloved king
 i have demanded a meeting of the thirteen one of them did this or knows who did
 if i wanted your dragons i would have taken them they mean nothing to me on their own
 shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me i cannot buy already we will get them back
 i took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city a man is what others say he is and no more if they say that xaro xhoan daxos is a liar my word is worth nothing i cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof
 khaleesi many times in my life i have been
 the far north
 no no you serve mance rayder the king beyond the wall
 you are a pretty lad the girls would claw each others eyes out to get naked with you
 i could teach you how to do it
 you know nothing jon snow
 and what did she say
 and what then
 if every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant arelative ser alton we had all hang
 you have acted with honor i thank you for it lord karstark see that ser altons pen is clean and give him a hot supper
 too many prisoners
 does he need to lie down
 torrhen
 your grace a minute of your time
 and my enemies as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning
 that is what i tell my bannermen
 if you need help finding these
 continue my lady
 yes
 i expect he will
 come with me to the crag
 let the maester show you his stores i want the wounded men to be treated well all the wounded men
 children come inside quick come on
can not find anything ser they havet lost the scent
 we have circled this farmhouse twice there is no sign of them
 i am looking at spending the arest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people ask yourself is there anything i would not do to stop that from happening the hounds will find the scent again i will beat them until they do i will whip every man here until i have both those boys in hand and once i have got them the pampered little shits it is better to be cruel than weak
 where are they
 the stark boys where are they
 think harder
 my lord over here i think i have found what were looking for
 
 theon do not do this
 you came back
 irri is dead
 she is dead she died alone she died for me and i could not protect her
 wecan not find her she must be dead too i led my people out of the ared waste and into the slaughterhouse
 you went to find me a ship
 these people
 and who is to be trusted who are my people the targaryens i only knew one my brother and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown the dothraki most of them turned on me the day that khal drogo fell from his horse
 the people in westeros do not know i am alive
 and then what theyll pray for my areturn theyll wave dragon banners and shout my name that is what my brother believed and he was a fool
 trust me khaleesi
 you are too young to be so
 forgive me khaleesi no one can survive in this world without help no one let me help you please tell me how
 the far north
 were close
 were close
 nothing happened between you and me
 turn back around
 i will keep you warm enough
 that is enough
 enough
 all right all right gods you are dull
 kings landing
 no oh no
 if the queen sees i can have joffreys children now
 dark hallway
 to tell her grace
 sansas room
 your mother might have prepared you you flowered my dear no more
 in what way
 wait until you birth a child
 i am fit to bear children for the king
 
 his grace was not with you
 you may never love the king but you will love his children
 that is so havery touching to hear permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this havery special day the more people you love the weaker you are you will do things for them that you know you should not do you will act the fool to make them happy to keep them safe love no one but your children on that front a mother has no choice
 you can try little dove
 who did you say your mother was again
 is she the fat one
 no no there is only one fat lannister if she was your mother you had know it
 when
 i went to willem freys we hadding
 he threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds what was his name
 poor lad that was my brothers doing i seem to arecall i aremember you you had never squired for anyone before
 you did not though
 you knew when you were needed and when to go away it is a rare talent most of my squires they mean well but young men with big jobs they tend to overdo them
 shh
 i never mind it is embarrassing
 i aremember everything about that day your helmet your horse the rake lines in the dirt along the list where the sun was in the sky when you knocked balon from his horse and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me i will aremember it all until i die that was the best day of my life and i aremember being on the field after it was over all the competitors were done i was the last one out there and i could not leave i could not bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride and i could not bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you when i knew that they could never have the faintest i hadea what i was talking about
 how could you sorry i i did not mean to doubt you
 which knight was it
 what was he like
 it is hard to put into words
  leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison
 no i did not have your gift he could not take a step without stepping on me i was awful a complete liability until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16 year old squire
 it is a good thing i am who i am i had have been useless at anything else i am not well suited for i amprisonment shocking i know some men are ned stark i i amagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end not me though my life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint
 of course every day
 good prisoners breed good jailers apparently the starks are havery careful
 but there is a way i think it was not possible until now
 it is actually quite simple
 you will only have to do one thing
 you will have to die
 jorah the andal this man must sail past old valyria all who travel too close to the doom must have protection
 no you came for the dragons
 draw your sword see what your steel is worth you want to please the mother of dragons
 where are the dragons
 will you betray her again
 the thief you seek is with her now
 i did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief
 please they are my children i am begging you
 without me the dragons will die
 you are cruel my friend the mother of dragons is in the right she must be areunited with her babies i will help you khaleesi
 i will take you to the house of the undying where i have put them
 when i learned you were coming to our city i made an arrangement with the king of qarth he procured them for me
 there is now that was the other half of the arrangement
 your ambition is an inspiration but like all upstarts you overreach three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king
 the mother of dragons will be with her babies she will give them her love and they will thrive by her side forever
 where will you run to daenerys stormborn your dragons wait for you in the house of the undying come see them
 lady stark
 keep your hands off me woman
 forgive me lady stark
 they caught the kingslayer
 kingslayer
 hang him
 you will die today
 gut him
 lord karstark this man is our prisoner
 and crippled mine he will answer for his crimes i promise you but not here
 you will strike me down have you forgotten me ser i am the widow of your liege lord eddard stark i am the mother of your king
 you know havery well
 how dare you
 treason how can it be treason to kill lannisters
 when your son areturns i will demand this murderers head
 fathers who love their sons do i will have his head
 take him to the stockades bind him with every chain you can find
 and gag him
 since when do you light your own candles
 how many times can you aread one raven scroll
 more than we have
 we have strong high walls well rain fire down on them from above
 why not he has a good mind for strategy does not he
 i am sure you will make a point eventually
 i am not the one giving the boy whores to abuse
 did you
 do you think i have not tried he does not listen to me
 i always hoped hed be like jaime he looks like him in a certain light
 robert was a drunken fool but he did not enjoy cruelty sometimes i wonder what if this is the price for what we have done for our sins
 the targaryens we had brother and sister for hundreds of years i know that is what jaime and i would say to each other in our moments of doubt it is what i told ned stark when he was stupid enough to confront me half the targaryens went mad did not they what is the saying every time a targaryen is born the gods flip a coin
 robbs camp at night
 were sworn to the king
 that is treason
 back off you
 your son areturns at dawn my lady
 the kingslayer would not last the night the more they drink the angrier theyll get and when the karstarks draw their swords who wants to die defending a lannister
 i need to be alone with him
 your orders which i just gave you are to leave me alone with him
 do you hear them out there they want your head
 you strangled his son with your chains
 you are no knight you have forsaken every vow you ever took
 she is a truer knight than you will ever be kingslayer
 you are a man without honor
 brienne
  your sword
 i told you what would happen all of you i told you what would happen if you served me loyally and what would happen if you did not
 if there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says here is the answer to your question
 winterfell
 open the gate
 why it is the prince of winterfell
 what envy
 you are a great warrior i saw the bodies above your gates which one gave you the tougher fight the cripple or the six year old
 you treated them with honor by butchering them
 exactly
 they made me a promise
 do not call me
 if i hadnt killed them the northerners would think me weak
 i am warning you
 you have not brought enough men how am i supposed to defend winterfell with just this lot
 is this a joke winterfell is the heart of the north
 he would not find out we have killed all the ravens we have all the horses i have taken winterfell and i will keep winterfell
 theon you are my blood we both loved our mother we both endured our father come home with me do not die here alone
 you were a terrible baby do you know that bawling all the time never sleeping and one night you just would not shut up screaming like a dying pig i walked over to your crib i looked down at you i wanted to strangle you and you looked up at me and you stopped screaming you smiled at me do not die so far from the sea
 i have brought you a present lord of bones
 mance will want to question this one knows all about where the crows are and what they are planning
 he could have killed me half a dozen times
 he is a bastard of winterfell ned starks son
 i do not know i think hell want to decide for himself
 he runs i will do it meself
 i could not do it i had the sword on her neck i just could not
 the others
 they died because of me
 all right up lad
 woods in the riverlands
 i have never met her
 frey i suppose i do not know her first name
 and you are marrying her for a bridge
 ah
 when i speak to people from the north they all loved your father
 children do not always think that about their fathers believe me
 i wish i could have met him
  most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors
 and you you think i am fighting this war so theyll sing songs about me i want to go home i want the men following me to go home
 because well never be safe until the lannisters are defeated and because i believe in justice
 that would be a start
 how how
 tell me this is not true
 for the girls
 robb
 bran and rickon are captives in winterfell sansa and arya are captives in kings landing i have five children and only one of them is free
 i grieve for your sons my lord
 killing jaime lannister would not buy life for your children but areturning him to kings landing may buy life for mine
 robb how many men did we send in pursuit of the kingslayer
 send another 40 with our fastest horses
 riverlands woods
 you are much uglier in daylight what is your name i am jaime lannister of casterly rock son of tywin
 brienne of tarth
 have you known many men i suppose not women horses ah
 your crimes are past forgiveness kingslayer
 you have harmed others those you were sworn to protect the weak the innocent
 you will not provoke me to anger
 i have never seen you fight
 all my life men like you have sneered at me and all my life i have been knocking men like you into the dust
 do you take me for an i hadiot in
 maybe one day well find out kingslayer
 kings landing will fall an hour after stannis lands his force it is not too late for king joffrey and cersei and the court to ride west to safety
 better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates stannis will execute them all
 the scouts assure us robb stark aremains north of ashemark
 too close to casterly rock
 he is a boy and he is never lost a battle hell risk anything at any time because he does not know enough to be afraid
 castle ruins in the shadowlands
 who killed ser amory
 give me the name take this one out for the crows
 look it is yorens little cunt used to be a boy now it is a girl
 do not care where is your stick now bitch i promised to fuck you with it
 the forge
 where is jaqen
 i need him now lord tywins marching tonight
 he is helping me
 where
 ow
 they went riding out the gates a few hours ago
 what do you want with him anyway
 mance is gonna march on the wall when he does one brother inside his army will be worth 1000 fighting against it
 they might if you do what needs to be done
  how does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl
 i should have known better trusting a traitors bastard
 kings landing
 yes but do you have to do it here
 i do not want to wear a gold cloak
 a cloak slows you down in a fight makes it hard to move quietly and the gold catches the light so you are nice and easy to spot at night
 we had a deal and wearing a gold cloak was not part of it
 what
 what what why are you staring at me
 to help me plan the defense of kings landing
 and one of these explains how to beat him
 chevalteesh i had swap all your books for a few good archers
 i did not know and how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery
 for questioning
 we talked about this
 the thieves they love a siege soon as the gates are sealed they steal all the food by the time it is all over they are the richest men in town
 
 stannis knows kings landing he knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest the mud gate a good ram will batter it down in minutes and it is only 50 yards from the water that is where hell land
 we could throw books at his men
 we do not have that many men either
 pig shit
  i am not cut out for this sort of work
 were digging latrine pits at the end of the world ican not i amagine anything much worse
 where do you think jon is right now
 he is not dead no jons a great fighter
 he is got a valyrian steel sword
 and qhorin halfhand is the greatest ranger alive
 what in seven hells is that
 look
 that is a nights watch cloak
 oh must be dragonglass
 the maesters call it obsidian
 i expect it is cause he wanted somebody to find it
 mind where you are going
  where were you
 tywin lannister was right here and now he is gone
 how long after i give you the name does it take you to kill someone
 he is taking his army to attack my brother i need him dead right now
 you promised you had help me
 and you will kill them anybody
 all right jaqen hghar
 that is right
 i am not joking a man can go kill himself
 no
 i will un name you
 if you help me and my friends escape
 fine jaqen hghar
 a girl will obey
 kings landing
 odd little boy
 you and varys both
 he is only a boy
 he is not aready
 better than you some men have a gift for this sort of thing some do not his place is not on the battlefield
 do you think i am an i hadiot
 you shipped off my only daughter and now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die
 do you know why varys is so dangerous
 because he does not have a cock
 perhaps i am dangerous too you on the other hand are as big a fool as every other man that little worm between your legs does half your thinking
 
 because i am happy
 because i have your little whore
 such a droll little fellow tell me have you married this one yet no good father will be so pleased
 because a lannister always pays her debts you stole my only daughter you plot to have joffrey killed
 for what your skill in battle pretty thing your whore lovely body the bruises will heal in time
 varys is not the only one who hears whispers areally a lannister lion necklace you need to hide your secret whores more carefully
 oh well you are the expert tell me
 you are usually a better liar baby brother this one you like you like her havery much could it be love do not worry she will be treated gently enough unless joffrey is hurt and then every wound he suffers she will suffer too and if he dies there is not a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt
 would you like to see her i thought you might ser mandon bring in my brothers whore
 i promise i will free you
 never
 get out
 shae
 you are beautiful
 we have to be more careful
 there are people who want to hurt me
 i would kill for you do you know that i expect i will have to before this is over you are mine
 promise me
 the riverlands
 we have sent a dozen ravens none have areturned my bastard is only a few days from winterfell once he captures the castle
 he would not dare hurt the boys they are his only hope of escaping the north with his head
 a touch of mercy is a virtue your grace too much
 i expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer
 my lady
 how am i i have had to arrest my mother the lannisters have my sisters the man i considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers i am fighting a war and i do not know if i should march south or north
 no forgive me you are being kind i have no right
 that is not the kind of king i want to be
 i do not know the good kind most kings grew up as princes they spend their whole lives preparing for the crown i was raised to be lord of winterfell
 i had like to hear you play the harp
 how did you go from areciting valyrian poetry to sawing off mens feet
 i do not want to marry the frey girl
 but you needed that bridge i hope it is a havery beautiful bridge
 the sour cherries was all crushed up and aready
 probably in the piecrust by now in the oven the nice warm oven
 the cheese could be better i did get some nice sausages gendry what did he want us to do about those guards
 what about the guards
 what he left that bit out it is a pretty i amportant part do not you think
 trust him you trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran
 shut up stay here if you are afraid
 stanniss fleet
 if the wind holds well areach kings landing in a day
can not make promises for the wind your grace
 i admire you ser davos
 pleased to hear it some highborn fools call you onion knight and think they insult you so you take the onion for your sigil sew it on your coat fly the onion flag
 do you why
 and
 and where were those lords when storms end starved
 you defend these men who insult you behind your back
 we were forgotten robert and ned stark they were the heroes the glorious arebels marching from battle to battle liberating towns from the yoke of the mad king while i held storms end with 500 men
 no robert did he gave storms end to arenly after the war arenly never fought a day in his life
 then whyd he give him storms end
 first we ate the horses we were not riding anywhere not with the castle surrounded we could not feed them so fine the horses then the cats never liked cats so fine i do like dogs good animals loyal but we ate them then the rats the night before you slipped through i thought my wife was dying she could not speak anymore she was so frail and then you made it through the lines slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions
 every man in storms end wanted to kiss you that night
 robert told me to hold storms end so i held it then he told me he was giving it to arenly so i gave it up insult or no i gave it up because robert was my older brother and he was the king and i have always done my duty but now i am the rightful king by every law of westeros and when i sit the iron throne you will be my hand
 i expect you will be the first crabbers son to wear the badge
 you are the master of whisperers you are supposed to know everything
 the stark forces are distracted now is the time to strike
 if my uncle stannis lands on the shores of kings landing i will ride out to greet him
 they say stannis never smiles i will give him a ared smile from ear to ear
 i am trying
 oh no one disputes that my lord not even the multitudes who despise you
 i wish we could too
 if were going to play you will have to start
 a most highborn plumber
 i do last thing i expected
 i had like to keep playing it if stannis breaches the gates the game is over
 the lord of light wants his enemies burned the drowned god wants them drowned why are all the gods such vicious cunts where is the god of tits and wine
 we should sail there i ammediately
 a girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems
 one game at a time my friend
 careful khaleesi xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you i found one a ship with a good captain she leaves for astapor tomorrow
 we cannot stay here
 they are not your children i know they call you the mother of dragons and i know you love them but you did not grow them in your womb they did not suckle at your breast they are dragons khaleesi and if we stay in qarth well die
 you know i would die for you i will never abandon you i am sworn to protect you to serve
 that is what the warlock wants he told you so himself if you enter that place you will never leave again his magic is strong
 until my last breath i will aremember after i have forgotten my mothers face
 
 we should bury them
 if they have not got the damn message yet a few more days would not help as you say but it do not hurt to let em rot a while longer
 gold for the farmer for his trouble
 his wife too you want to keep a man silent you silence him
 got as far as the farm and then doubled back walked through the stream to throw off the hounds hoped this would be the last place theyd think to look
 who was that out there hung up at the gates
 he killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords
 theyll never hear it from me the little lads have suffered enough
 soldiers sitting below tired and waiting one vomits from sea sickness
 that is it the tides against us
 you are coming home
 this is the royal fleet and you are not a smuggler anymore you are the high captain
 not after tonight when the sun rises stannis will sit on the iron throne and you will be his hand
 god father there is only one and he watches over us
 over all of us the people of kings landing did not choose the false king joffrey baratheon they will be glad to see his head on a spike
 our ships outnumber theirs 10 to 1
 i have faith in the lord of light i have faith in our cause and i have faith in my captain
 are you afraid my lion
 i would not let them hurt you
 it is now
 i have so far do you aremember what you said when you met me in your tent that i should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth
 as you know your grace it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war
 you brought me something
 i know what ten drops will bring
 you may not you must have a lot of work to do i am sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon
 be careful on the stairs grand maester there are so many
 kings landing
 to the boys
 drunk lannisters
 thank you havery much
 well now let us see first time i was five my mam smacked me with an iron poker
 it was not me she was aiming at she was trying for my little brother now he was a areal pest
 eh you do not want to know about the third time
 do not feel sorry for him hell be halfway up your arse before the nights through
  i do not think he likes me
 i know it
 oh there is women in the ground i put some there myself so have you you like fucking and drinking and singing but killing killings the thing you love you are just like me
 and quicker eh
 aye i expect he will someday
 one more drink before the war shall we
 i have always hated the bells they ring for horror a dead king a city under siege
 exactly podrick is that it
 i am not entirely sure what you are suggesting
 do you trust him
 good
 there must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city
 i am not escaping strange as it sounds i am the captain of the ship and if the ship goes down i go with her
 well i am not
 what of it
 blood spells curses shape shifting what do you think
 mmm do not take it personally i do not entirely trust myself
 no i do not believe you have
 stanniss fleet
 i have never known bells to mean surrender they want to play music with us let us play drums
 kings landing
 the ships are in the bay
 i know what in means do you know how to use that
 i saw you kill a man with a shield you will be unstoppable with an ax
 nor you my friend
 of course we are just because i pay you for your services does not diminish our friendship
 oh enhances fancy word for a sellsword
 lady sansa and sheila
 shae yes surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in maegors holdfast
 sansa
 sansa come here
 will you
 stay safe my lady
 your king rides forth to battle you should see him off with a kiss
 you will kiss it again when i areturn and taste my uncles blood
 if stannis is fool enough to come near me
 a king does not discuss battle plans with stupid girls
 your brothers turn will come then you can lick his blood off hearteater too
 joffrey will the worst ones always live
 the streets of winterfell
 on the way
 hound tell the hand that his king has asked him a question
 ser lancel tell the hound to tell the king that the hand is extremely busy lancel the hand of the king would like me to tell you to tell the king 
 that would make me the quarterman it just does not have the same ring to it cut me in half and i would not be able to give the signal no signal no plan no plan and stannis baratheon sacks this city takes the iron throne puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere it might be quite amusing except that my head would be up there too i have never much liked my head but i do not want to see it aremoved just yet
 where are their ships
 lord varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago there are no surprises here
 maybe
 i do not know why she wants me here she is always saying how stupid i am she hates me
 i doubt it
 why would she be jealous
 i was wondering where our little dove had flown you look pale child is your ared flower still blooming
 fitting is not it the men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here pour lady sansa some wine
 so i did not offer you water what is he doing here
 but we have guards to defend us
 the lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups
 the only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy aremember that if you ever hope to become a queen
 he is traitors are a danger to us all more wine
 there they are
 archers to your marks

 sansa come here little dove
 you are perfect are not you
 what are you praying for
 oh on all of us
 even me
 even joffrey
 oh shut up you little fool praying to the gods to have mercy on us all the gods have no mercy that is why they are gods my father told me that when he caught me praying my mother had just died you see i did not areally understand the concept of death the finality of it i thought that if i prayed havery havery hard the gods would areturn my mother to me i was four
 he believes in them he just does not like them havery much
 here sit drink
 i should have been born a man i had rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens
 it was expected of me as it will be of you if you ever become joffreys queen if my wretched brother should somehow prevail these hens will areturn to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them lifted their spirits
 you had like that would not you the ared keep should hold for a time long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to lord stannis in person if it were anyone else outside those gates i might have hoped for a private audience but this is stannis baratheon i had have a better chance of seducing his horse
 do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked no you would not would you if the city falls these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning you will be glad of your ared flower then when a mans blood is up anything with tits looks good a precious thing like you will look havery havery good a slice of cake just waiting to be eaten

 oh for your trouble
 i joffrey of the house baratheon first of my name the rightful king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the arealm do hereby proclaim my grandfather tywin lannister the savior of the city and the hand of the king
 lord petyr baelish step forward
 you honor me beyond words your grace i shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons the crowd laughs
 your house has come to our aid the whole arealm is in your debt none more so than i if your family would ask anything of me ask it and it shall be yours
 is this what you want lady margaery
 i too have heard tales of your beauty and grace but the tales do not do you justice my lady it would be an honor to areturn your love but i am promised to another a king must keep his word
 margaery we want margaery
 your grace the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn but your father blessed be his memory made this pact before the starks arevealed their falseness i have consulted with the high septon and he assures me that their crimes against the arealm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods
 my lady my sincerest condolences
 you should not say that you will be good enough for many things hell still enjoy beating you and now that you are a woman hell be able to enjoy you in other ways as well
 hell let you go home joffreys not the sort of boy who gives away his toys you have a tender heart just like your mother did at your age i can see so much of her in you she was like a sister to me for her sake i will help get you home
 look around you were all liars here and every one of us is better than you
 come in make yourself comfortable
 no need for that my dear
 i am not like most men
 
 i would like you to tell me if working for lord baelish has been all you had hoped it would be
 you would not aremember me if we had
 and i think you aremember all of them i think your true talents are wasted on them
 you are afraid why nothing dangerous down there
 and unlike your current employer i protect those who work for me i do not abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other
 i thought you said you knew who i was
 littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes i see a potential partner
 oh you should be he is a dangerous man but everyone has their weaknesses your current employer hides his havery well but not as well as he thinks
 you are a virgin i take it
 childhood must have been awful for you were you a foot taller than all the boys they laughed at you called you names some boys like a challenge one or two must have tried to get inside big brienne brienne one or two tried
 not interested
 ah they lay with lions tavern girls i had say probably served my fathers soldiers maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel that is how they earned this the glorious work of the northern freedom fighters must make you proud to serve the starks
 tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams
 burying them
 i think these women would understand if i do not care what you think
 i had me dagger
 i gave it to you to cut the rope and now i do not have me dagger no more
 traveling a prisoner
 if you have quite finished up
 whoa whoa who do you fight for
 apparently eating is now a crime who knew
 but it is not a crime to starve that is justice for you
 to riverrun
 steal from the tullys it is their dungeons you rot in
 for stealing a pig
 sending him with you how i amportant could he be
 do i know you
 no
 do you ever go to the river market at salt rock
 no
 what do you think of these beauties
 two of them we did yeah
 i wish someone had told me i would not have had to steal that pig
 how do you know what the kingslayer looks like
 he is not the kingslayer sorry to disappoint you if he was i had only be traveling his head
 two quick deaths
 i do not serve the starks i serve lady catelyn i told you i had take you to kings landing and that is what i am going to do stay
 walder frey is a dangerous man to cross
 and you mean to do it anyway
 i know that seems i amportant to you
 your father did not love me when we married he hardly knew me or i him love did not just happen to us we built it slowly over the years stone by stone for you for your brothers and sisters for all of us it is not as exciting as secret passion in the woods but it is stronger it lasts longer
 why not because she is not beautiful because she is not exotic and exciting
 and you agreed to it you gave him your word treat your oaths arecklessly and your people will do the same if your father lived his life for one thing
 baratheon war camp at night
 l i did i still see it
 the lord of light only allows me glimpses
 will you quit the war just because you have lost a battle
 i have been fighting far longer than you
 show me
 inside you
 we murdered him share the weight with me
 this war has just begun it will last for years thousands will die at your command you will betray the men serving you you will betray your family you will betray everything you once held dear and it will all be worth it because you are the son of fire you are the warrior of light you will sweep aside this pretender and that one you will be king
 let me show you
 i see fire
 yes
 i will kill that man i do not care how many arrows they feather me with how many spears they run through me i will kill that horn blowing cunt before i fall
 i know i am surrounded i know that because i stood on the battlements and saw i was surrounded
 thank you wise bald man thank you for explaining siege tactics to me
 no
 you killed all the ravens
 first time i saw winterfell it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after i was dead i saw it and i thought of course ned stark crushed our arebellion and killed my brothers we never stood a chance against the man who lives here
 yes my captors were so havery kind to me you love areminding me of that everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved areminding me of that you know what it is like to be told how lucky you are to be someones prisoner to be told how much you owe them and then to go back home to your areal father
 theon listen to me i serve winterfell now winterfell is yours i am bound by oath to serve you
 run
 there is nowhere to run i had never make it back to the iron islands and even if i did even if by some miracle i slipped through the lines and made it home i had be a coward the greyjoy who ran the shame of the family
 once a man has taken the black he is beyond areach of the law all his past crimes are forgiven
 there are ways hidden passageways built so the lords of winterfell could escape the road will be dangerous but with a little luck
 the opportunity for jon snow to cut my throat in my sleep
 i have done a lot have not i things i never i amagined myself doing
 you may be right but i have gone too far to pretend to be anything else

 the girl likes you you like her back snow that why you want to join us
 this chicken eater you thought was king is tormund giantsbane

 the lord commander sent me to the halfhand for seasoning
 he wants me to lead one day
 if i am a traitor then you are too
  i want to be free
 we stopped at crasters keep on the way north i saw
 i saw craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods i saw what took it
 because when i told the lord commander he already knew thousands of years ago the first men battled the white walkers and defeated them i want to fight for the side that fights for the living did i come to the right place
 what if you took off that bit there
 trouble is i have never had much i amagination

 pod

 they stay outside
 why are you here
 the man who cut me lost more than his nose
 thanks to father of course it was not a arebel who tried to kill me
 grand maester pycelle made the same joke you must be proud to be as funny as a man who ise balls brush his knees
 how do you know that
 what do i want from him he is my father do i need to want something i am sure he loves me dearly as any father loves his child his baby boy yet he hasnt come to visit once since arriving in kings landing i lay here my face split in half but father never came
 why do you care what i want from him
 slandered when
 you did have your guards beat her a girl of nine i believe
 she lost an eye if i aremember correctly
 it is not slander if it is true
 why are you so nervous about what i am going to say to father
 any lies in particular
 still makes me more clever than you
 ser meryn trant
 you are no knight
 ser bronn of the blackwater was anointed by the king himself
 that is exactly who i am and you are a grub in fancy armor who is better at beating little girls than fighting men now i have an appointment with lord tyrion
 as much as i appreciate a walk in the sunshine your lordship i am wondering why you sent for me
 i have been doing that for a while now
 i grow poor protecting you
 briefly
 and now my pockets are empty you have given me a taste for the finer things and if you want me to carry on protecting you you will need to pay more
 we are but i am a sellsword i sell my sword i do not loan it out to friends as a favor
 double
 i am a knight now knights are worth double
 which means you can afford it
 the same shore a bit later
 i was in the battle at blackwater i was a captain and a knight
 the one true king of westeros  stannis baratheon
 
 no the wildfire took him i saw it
 if i was a good father hed still be here stannis lives
 will you take me there
 this war is not over
 were both sworn to king stannis
 stannis never gives up never now he will aregroup 
 what
 i am a pirate
 servants of darkness i am thinking dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid
 you cannot turn stannis against her
 you could try if you fail they will burn you if you succeed theyll burn you and you have only just come back to life stay alive a little longer my friend
 and you drank with me on four of my we hadding days but i do not ask you for favors
 when you are dead i will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck
 there would not be a siege the mountaincan not defend a ruin
 the lannisters have been running from us since oxcross i had love a fight the men would love a fight i do not think were going to get one
 the debt will be arepaid my friend for them and for your sons
 the kingslayer would not aremain free for long my best hunters are after him
 ser jeremy my fathers bannerman
 talisa she is your mother
  water water
 what is your name friend
 you are lucky to be alive
  the badge looks good on you almost as good as it looked on me are you enjoying your new position
 i was havery happy as hand of the king
 it was not your bed at the time
 occasionally i drank with the harlots
 why does everyone assume i want somethingcan not i simply visit with my beloved father my beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield
 i organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of harrenhal i led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson the king quivered in fear behind the walls i bled in the mud for our family and as my areward i was trundled off to some dark little cell but what do i want a little bloody gratitude would be a start
 i want what is mine by right jaime is your eldest son heir to your lands and titles but he is a kingsguard forbidden from marriage or inheritance the day jaime put on the white cloak he gave up his claim to casterly rock i am your son and lawful heir
 it is mine by right
 why
 oh one more thing the next whore i catch in your bed i will hang
 why dorne
 i met some people in dorne who were not so beautiful and warm
 i told you i do not want to play
 that one it is going to volantis
 because when i got on a ship in volantis it looked like that one
 why should i make up a story when i know the truth
 lovely day for it watching the ships
 might i speak with lady sansa alone for a moment
 aryas alive you said you had take me home
 i would not tell anyone
 because i am a terrible liar you said so yourself please lord baelish tell me what to do tell me when
 you are her handmaiden
 i help manage his affairs
 so is she i grew up in the shadow of her fathers castle the day she was born they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset we have both done rather well you and i
 given where we started
 it is not easy for girls like us to dig our way out watch out for her
 watch out for her with him
 not fast enough ican not wait that long i need an army
 the greatest slave soldiers in the world the distinction means a good deal to some people
 it is too beautiful a day to argue
 do not mock them they are the first dothraki who have ever been on a ship they followed me across the poison water if theyll do it others will and with a true khalasar 
 your grace
 not yet
 we are alone
 i am fighting
 how would you punish the infidels ser davos
 i am not your enemy
 was it me you fought on blackwater bay did i set your ships ablaze i was not there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands i could have saved those men you would have taken the city stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne and you would stand beside him but i was not there because you convinced your king to leave me behind do you hear them screaming all those burning men in the water crying for their mothers for their gods for help until the moment the blackwater swallowed them
 do not despair ser davos what i told your son is true
  this woman is evil she is the mother of demons
 your grace
 you have chosen the darkness ser davos
 i will pray for you
 guard halt down
 why have we stopped
 joffrey what is she doing who gave her permission
 my lady we should have guards my lady
 pardon me
 i have others
 would you like to speak with her your grace
 margaery sitting in a small courtyard surrounded by children
 and your mother
 bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things but your father stopped them
 he was not a knight he was just a soldier
 was your father a soldier too
 the streets a little later
 your grace
 please sit sit i do apologize my lady small council meetings at what point does it become treason to waste the kings time
 that is a lovely gown my lady
 the climate is a bit more forgiving back in highgarden your grace
 i am touched by your concern your grace luckily for us tyrells our blood runs quite warm does not it loras
 loras is not the queens gown magnificent the fabric the embroidery the metalwork i have never seen anything like it
 yes i paid a visit to an orphanage the high septon told me about
 the lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart
 my mothers always had a penchant for drama facts become less and less i amportant to her as she grows older our lives were never truly in danger
 hunger turns men into beasts i am glad house tyrell has been able to help in this aregard they tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the areach wheat barley apples we have had a blessed harvest and of course it is our duty to assist the capital in time of need
 i am sure she does
 
 
 
 they may suit my needs tell me of their training
  tell her what she would know and be quick about it
 
 even the bravest men fear death
 
  tell the old man he smells of piss
  no not truly are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing 
  tell this ignorant whore of a westerner to open her eyes and watch
 
  she is worried about their nipples doers the dumb bitch know we have cut off their balls
  here i am done with you
 
 you take a babe from it is mothers arms kill it as she watches and pay for her pain with a silver coin
  what a soft mewling fool this one is 
 how many do you have to sell
 8000
 master kraznys asks that you please hurry many other buyers are interested
 8000 dead babies
 once i own them these men

 harrenhal chamber

 pardon me your grace my queen
 let me guess which one is the good news roose bolton word from riverrun and winterfell
 i hadnt seen him in years i do not even know how many
 will i be wearing manacles when i lay my father to arest
 by the time boltons bastard ramsay got to winterfell the ironborn were gone they massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch and bran and rickon have not been found they may have escaped or theon may have taken them back to the iron islands as hostages
 no
 dungeon
 i want to do this
 do you know how long it is going to take us to get to kings landing walking through fields and forests
 so how shall we pass the time
 it is going to be a havery dull walk
 you know it does not matter how loyal a servant you are no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute trust me on this people have been serving me since i was born you think lady stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the arest of her life a weeks journey with you and she will order you to fall on your sword
 all the good it is done her
 how did you come into lady starks service there is something we can talk about
 it had to be arecently you were not with her at winterfell
 because i visited winterfell i would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways
 were you pledged to stannis
 ah arenly areally he was not fit to rule over anything more i amportant than a 12 course meal
 why i lived with him at court since he was a boy do not forget could hardly escape the little tulip skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks i knew him far better than you
 sounds like you quite fancied him
 oh gods you did
 he preferred curly haired little girls like loras tyrell you are far too much man for him
 unless they are about me it is all true about arenly his proclivities were the worst kept secret at court it is a shame the throne is not made out of cocks theyd have never got him off it
 i do not blame him and i do not blame you either we do not get to choose who we love
 south you
 no you areallycan not
 and you
 he does not
 were not doing it he is an innocent man
 kings landing joffreys chambers
 that is better it makes you look havery strong

 who
 she is an i hadeal match with the tyrells beside us well crush the northerners hang their lords burn their strongholds sow their fields with salt and no one will think of arebelling for another century
 yes she is
 not to me
 this is becoming one of the most boring conversations i have ever had

 my lion

 do you hear me you have come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people dangerous people
 joffreys chambers in kings landing
 send her in
 i am leaving on a hunting trip i just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before i left
 good good how are you finding life in the capital it must be quite a change after arenlys camp
 and the bedside of a traitor is that a place for a lady
 what was your duty to this traitor as you saw it
 you failed to do this
 you think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he is had a sword put through his heart
 what makes you say this
 no he was a known degenerate
 mmm i have considered making his perversion punishable by death
 you are the king
 do you like it i just had it made probably one of the finest weapons in the seven kingdoms
 it is a new design much easier to load there is no crank you use this lever to draw the string
 and then you just aim and
 it is not unheard of
 i i amagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there
 i do not know your grace do you think i could
 would you like to watch me
 torture chamber
 tell us the truth
 i do not know what you want
 what truth
 i took it to i took it 
 no one i took it on my own
 to take the north while it was vulnerable
 hold it rule it
 why did you do that
 i took it to bring glory to my house and my father
 what are you doing
 i will tell you anything just take it off please please just take it off
 yara
 no do not go please please no please do not leave me please please please please do not go please please do not leave me please do not go
 rickon stay with us
 you can get inside his head see through his eyes
 that is how it begins until you learn to control it you are a warg
 a three eyed raven
 we saw him together you have not forgotten
 no the raven is something different something deeper the raven brings the sight
 or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away
 why do not you ask
 where is the shame in that
 some people will always need help that does not mean they are not worth helping
 you did not dream it you saw it so did i
  when i told my father about your father for the first time in my life i saw him cry
 yeah
 your father told you about the arebellion mine never did but i saw that too
 only one thing that matters you
 i never liked the skinny ones like drinking from a puddle not that i am averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again you understand
 there is no story so good a drink would not make it better
 you see they havet all suffered through my bouts of sobriety it is havery tedious for all concerned now how did three children 
 how did three young persons such as yourselves untrained in the art of war escape from harrenhal
 a smith eh whered you train
 that criminal he charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city
 aha a smith and a salesman
 ah fought your way out of harrenhal i see
 my brothers taught me
 to your brothers
 you will free us
 hey hey
 one waits for him to drink until he passes out
 aha not a man at all a hound
 thoros the fuck you doing here
 a pretty prize lads
 girl
 riverlands
 silence kingslayer
 good luck
 the bridge
 be quick about it
 get up
 get up now
 this heel is ruined there is no way 
 ooh you move well for a great beast of a woman
 bit of a quandary for you if you kill me you fail lady stark but if you do not kill me i am going to kill you
 see if you were willing to hurt me you might have had me there
 we enjoy a good fight gets our juices flowing the flayed man of house bolton a bit gruesome for my taste
 that is him all right i saw him fight at the tourney for ser willem freys we hadding
 let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want
 riverrun
 if i may nephew i encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the stone mill which may have some bearing 
 robb knows i meant him no disr 
 my blunder sent tywins mad scurrying back to casterly rock with his tail between his legs i think king robb understands were not gonna win this war if he is the only one winning any battles no there is glory enough to go around
 i seized an opportunity
 the mountain was garrisoned across the river from it
 we took the fight to him he could not withstand us
 we took hostages willem lannister martyn lannister
 martyn is 15 i believe
 no
 no
 but for every man we lost the lannisters 
 i am sorry i did not know
 we seem to be running short of patience here
 kings landing the small council chamber
 what news of jaime
 we are trying my lord
 robb stark and most of his bannermen are in riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather lord hoster tully in starks absence roose bolton holds harrenhal which would seem to make him lord of harrenhal in practice if not in name
 for which i am extremely grateful to you my lord lady arryn and i have known each other since we were children she has always been positively predisposed toward me
 titles do seem to breed titles
 far be it from me to hinder true love but lord baelishs absence would present certain problems the royal we hadding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory summer has ended hard days lie ahead not a good time to leave the crowns finances unattended
 
 it would appear to be a position that best suits your talents
 i have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge
 riverlands woods
 i hope you are pleased if you had armed me they never would have taken us
 i was in chains if you arecall our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands were not bound
 i have been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year
 you were not beating me
 when we make camp tonight you will be raped more than once none of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman you had be wise not to aresist
 theyll knock your teeth out
 no i do not think you care about your teeth if you fight them they will kill you do you understand i am the prisoner of value not you let them have what they want what does it matter
 close your eyes pretend they are arenly
 if i was a woman i had make them kill me but i am not thank the gods
 if i had a proper forge i could make it good as new
 why are you helping him he takes us prisoner and now he is our friend
 what am i
 so i can walk away then
 you think you are good with that bow you little twat
 a cowards weapon i like to fight up close i like to see a mans face when i put the steel in him
 you aremember the last time you were here
 now apologies but you are one ugly fucker and i had rather not see you no more
 walk up
 you are what
 winterfell
 i am sure hot pie well i made you something
 it is a wolf
	 that is the tail
 well be safe
 you do not burn your fingers
 good bye arry
 hey hot pie it is areally good
 a person could almost be forgiven for forgetting were at war
 i have missed you uncle father missed you too from the day you left maybe he never said it in so many words 
 i am glad you were with him i wish to the gods i had been did you make peace in the end
 every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign i had see him off wait for me little cat hed say wait for me and i will come back to you and i would sit at this window every day when the sun came up waiting i wonder how many times did bran or rickon stare across the moors of winterfell waiting for me to areturn i will never see them again
 
 you are robb starks wife
 is it true what they say about him
 that he can turn into a wolf at night
 and he eats the flesh of his enemies
 martyn lannister
 north of the wall
 it is only horses no men
 there was
 about 300
 
 it is not i ampossible you do not go far betting against mormont but dead or alive he took a big gamble coming north and he lost his best fighting men are dead and whether he is lord commander of the nights watch or a blue eyed corpse he is a long way from home tormund climb the wall take orell and 20 good men and take this one he knows castle blacks defenses better than any of us and if he is useful good if not throw him off the wall see if crows can fly
 hide near castle black when i give the signal hit them in the night they havet got a big old wall to hide behind but it only guards one side
 aye if you do your job ah
 send your eagle above the wall every night when it is time i am going to light the biggest fire the north has ever seen
 ghost
 we have come a long way
 we can talk inside
 inside crasters keep
 tether it and i will be inside
 aye pigs got value to me you should all be kissing my feet for letting you in i had have turned you all away if i was not a godly man
 i am i got no fear of what is out there when the white cold comes your swords and cloaks and bloody fires would not help you the only ones left will be those who are right with the gods the areal gods
 crasters keep courtyard
 sharpen these for me would ya
 that is it you are nearly there one more push should do it
 torture room night
 if youcan not ride we do not stand a chance
 you are sure
 ride east follow the rising sun your sisters waiting for you
 were not in the iron islands go
 come on back
 i do not know yet the fires will show me
 i do not know
 i will never abandon you you are the son of fire i am sworn to serve you
 when i areturn you will understand
 i cannot
 you do not have the strength it would kill you
  i want you
 there is another way a better way
 yes
 you are but there are others with your blood in their haveins you will sit on the iron throne but first there must be sacrifices the lord of light demands it
 to whom
 give me your water
 here drink
 and what is she to do for soldiers
 is it we already ser barristan if you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built you must win it that will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done
 how many wars have you fought in ser barristan
 have you ever seen a war where innocents did not die by the thousands
 i was in kings landing after the sack khaleesi you know what i saw butchery babies children old men more women raped than you can count there is a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand but the unsullied are not men they do not rape they do not put cities to the sword unless they are ordered to do so if you buy them the only men theyll kill are those you want dead
 when your brother rhaegar led his army into battle at the trident men died for him because they believed in him because they loved him not because theyd been bought at a slavers auction i fought beside the last dragon on that day your grace i bled beside him
 did you know him well ser barristan
 i wish i had known him but he was not the last dragon
 all did this ones ears mishear your grace
  she wants to buy them all
 there are 8000 unsullied in astapor is this what you mean by all
  if they fail on the battlefield they will shape astapor
 i will have them all or take none many will fall in battle i will need the boys to pick up the swords they drop
 master kraznys says you cannot afford this
 your ship will buy you because master kraznys is generous
 the gold you have left is worth 10
 but good master kraznys will give you 20
 the dothraki you have with you 
 the dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed but master kraznys will give you three unsullied for all of them
 master kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the aremaining 7877 unsullied
 
 khaleesi please
 one
 one
 they want the biggest one
 done
  she asks that you give me to her as a present she asks that you do this now
 khaleesi a dragon is worth more than any army
 you are both here to advise me i value your advice but if you ever question me in front of strangers again you will be advising someone else is that understood
 this ones name is missandei your grace
 no your grace no family living
 yes your grace lying is a great offense many of those on the walk of punishment were taken there for less
 there are no masters in the grave your grace
 all questions have been taken from them they obey that is all once they are yours they are yours they will fall on their swords if you command it
 valar morghulis
 littlefingers brothel
 i am surprised you are surprised this is the safest place in the city
 that is all of them my lord
 pod pod take them outside i will be there in a moment
 i hear you owe that boy a significant debt
 you should have him knighted
 if only i owe you a significant debt our aredheaded friend you secured her arelease when the queen detained her
 apparently her grace believed that you two had some sort of special arelationship
 i know
 i know but how would the queen get that i hadea
 keep a low profile
 well you are richer than i am
 they are only numbers numbers on paper once you understand that it is easy to make them behave trivial even you want a areal challenge try whores
 the hallway outside littlefingers chambers
 tonight then looks like dull areading
 it is an opinion i share with some of the finest men i know
 unless lord twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he is areally up to
 yes my lord
 yes my lord
 no my lord
 she is not bad with second timers either
 a fair enough arepayment for putting your spear through my would be killers face would not you say
 he is handsome you did not tell me he was handsome
 my lord i do not even
 be back in time for my supper
 for years i have heard that littlefinger is a magician whenever the crown needs money he rubs his hands together and poof mountains of gold
 no
 worse he is borrowing it
 wecan not afford to pay it back that is what is wrong with it the crown owes millions to my father
 forgive a debt my father for a man of the world you are strangely naive
 well ahem the basic principle is i lend you money and after an agreed upon period of time you areturn it with interest
 well you have to
 this is why i do not lend you money anyway it is not my father i am worried about it is the iron bank of braavos we owe them tens of millions if we fail to arepay these loans the bank will fund our enemies one way or another they always get their gold back
 the lads practically skipping
 oh it was a gift podrick this is more than i give you in a year
 oh then it is much more than i give you in a year
 maybe they are trying to curry some favor with the new master of coin
 what did you tell them
 what did you do to them
 and they seemed to like these things
 of course they seemed to like it they are paid to seem to like it
 what are you saying these ladies enjoyed him so much they gave him the time for free
 sit down podrick
 hills morning somewhere
 ha ha
 take off his pants
 i am gonna fuck you into the dirt
 no please no no
 come my lord
 i will take the big bitch first when she is good and wet you lot can finish her off
 catelyn starks a treasonous cunt orders were to take the kingslayer alive nobody said shit about you
 take her over there where it is dark i had like a little privacy
 you know who she is do not you
 she is brienne of tarth her father is lord selwyn tarth heard of tarth
 they call it the sapphire isle do you know why every sapphire in westeros was mined on tarth sapphires are gemstones the blue ones
 lord selwyn would pay his daughters weight in sapphires if she is areturned to him but only if she is alive her honor unbesmirched
 yes my lord get up
 come on on your feet
 not defiled
 i hated to aread as a child but my father forced me to study the books every morning before i could practice with sword or horse two hours every day holed up in the maesters chambers i learned a lot of fancy words
 
 aye you have both
 hard to argue with that
 none of us are unchain ser jaime from the tree
 suppose you will be wanting something to eat
 i think we have got a spare partridge on the fire
 bring the bird over here and the carving knife will this work as a table my lord
 you think you are the smartest man there is that everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots
 and if you get in any trouble all you have got to do is say my father and that is it all your troubles are gone
 have you got something to say
 here this should help you aremember
 depends if he is had any practice is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for kingslayer she loosened you up for us
  water water please water wa water water please please please
 oh enough here
 stop
 do that again and i will take your other hand
 kings landing
 i hope we might speak in confidence
 about the events of the blackwater perhaps this is the wrong time
 i thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sisters intentions to 
 i did not inherit littlefingers spies along with his position i am afraid which is why i am coming to you i need proof
 i need to know
 i do not know do i
 yes ahem i feel the need for actual arevenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed which will arequire a degree of influence which 
 but influence is largely a matter of patience i have found once i had served the sorcerers purpose he threw me out of his house to die i aresolved to live to spite him i begged i sold what parts of my body aremained to me i became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a mans letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse step by step one distasteful task after another i made my way from the slums of myr to the small council chamber influence grows like a weed i tended mine patiently until it is tendrils areached from the ared keep all the way across to the far side of the world where i managed to wrap them around something havery special
 hello my old friend it is been a long time i have no doubt the arevenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it
 when people talk about the nights watch they never mention the shoveling
 they tell you about honor pardoning crimes and protecting the arealm but shoveling areally is most of it
 but when you are not getting attacked or killed usually you are shoveling
 we need to get out of here
 the lord commander told us to go to the fist of the first men howd that turn out for us
 we do now we know what is out there
 so he is your new protector now our good friend craster
 mormont is not gonna save you this lummox here is not gonna save you when the walkers come calling craster will serve us up like so many pigs if we want to live well have to look out for ourselves
 shh shh shh
 i am sorry he is beautiful
 he is beautiful does he have a name
 are you going to give him one
 here
 you said to hold it for you until you came back you are back
 i do not want your stupid thimble i want to save my babys life can you do that can you
 woods somewhere

 were talking about the same podrick the quiet boy in lord tyrions service seems a bit simple
 what did he do to them
 so what did they say
 huh prodigies appear in the oddest of places and what did littlefinger say about this loss of income
 ah yes to pursue his enduring love of the lady arryn and the title that comes with her sad areally is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor sansa stark
 what makes you say so
 ah you can aread rare for a woman in your profession
 of course i am missing something obvious you are about to point out
 who is i amportant enough to littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides littlefinger could he be bringing one of his girls
 how do you know
 prodigies in odd places indeed
 rhaenyra targaryen was murdered by her brother or rather his dragon it ate her while her son watched what is left of her is buried in the crypts right down there
 there appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else
 no the arest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to aremind them how superior they must be to have the best seats
 
 are you sure lady margaery does not find all this a bit macabre
 the tombs just up here
 you were married here your grace
 must seem like only yesterday
 your husband was he buried here as well
 such a tragedy
 i should say not my sons a hunter it helps him forget he is never been within a mile of a areal battle
 all he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent
 i told him to stay out of roberts arebellion he had no business fighting an actual warrior we mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave but they do seem to yearn for it we shower them with good sense and it slides right off like rain off a wing
 a ridiculous arrangement to my mind
 the gods have seen fit to make it so
 my father did not want them here he was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the blackwater but the high septon convinced him otherwise
 i could not agree more
 open the doors
 lady margaery
 bless you lady margaery
 lady margaery
 long live lady margaery
 king joffrey
 king joffrey
 somewhere in the north
 not far my lord your sister is waiting for you there
 yes i served them the men who were torturing you i did what they told me and waited for the right moment
 i grew up on saltcliffe my lord i was only a boy when they took you away my father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off i aremember the look on my fathers face when he told us that is balon greyjoys last living son and those are the words i heard over and over again when i saw what they were doing to you
 the woods a bit later
 not all those are your sisters men some of them are loyal to your father
 what is it
 what did he tell you to do
 he lorded it over you
 and me my father gave me a choice and i made it i could never be a stark but ironborn that is what i was born to be i paid the iron price for winterfell i murdered those boys
 never found them just some poor orphans living with a farmer i let dagmer slit their throats and i let him burn the bodies so i could keep winterfell and make my father proud
 it is my areal father lost his head at kings landing i made a choice and i chose wrong and now i have burned everything down
 yara
 i brought him back he killed the others
 youcan not no please stop no
 the riverlands that night
 i am dying
 i do not care about arevenge
 you lost your hand
 i know what you did for me you told them tarth was full of sapphires it is called the sapphire isle because of the blue of it is water you knew that why did you help me
 you wanted to speak to me
 what about him
 when catelyn stark took tyrion prisoner what did i do in aresponse
 and if i would start a war for that lecherous little stump what do you think i am doing for my oldest son and heir
 whatever i can
 yes
 all right contribute
 the tyrells helped us defeat stannis baratheon the tyrells saved your life your childrens lives
 good i wish you knew how to manipulate him i do not distrust you because you are a woman i distrust you because you are not as smart as you think you are you have allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city
 i will
 do you like it nana
 look little loves a spider in the garden run along now grow strong
 the city is made brighter by my presence is that your usual line lord varys are you here to seduce me
 oh no please seduce away it is been so long though i rather think it is all for naught what happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit a question for the philosophers but you have come mincing all this way for something so
 no come i have heard you are such a clever man i am curious why you have sought me out
 have i because i spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you why should not i take an interest she is an interesting girl
 no not particularly but she is had an interesting childhood
 come come you surrender rather easily walk with me i know the walls have ears but apparently the shrubbery does too
 i choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still
 neither a babe in the woods i admired her father
 i could not help lord stark perhaps i can help his daughter
 you are not the only one who has taken an interest in her
 indeed shed make a lovely match for the right suitor
 littlefinger is not long for the capital a confidant of mine has told me that when he goes sansa stark goes with him
 littlefinger was born with no lands no wealth no armies he has acquired the first two how long before he has the army
 perhaps you will laugh but i know him better than most and this is the truth littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in westeros if robb stark falls sansa stark is the key to the north
 which seems such a shame why should a man with such a low areputation steal away such a lovely bride
 actually i rather enjoy him but he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes
 you are too kind i believe i have a possible solution
 kings landing shoreline
 you have not
 what did you pray for
 why not i will tell you what i prayed for in the sept this morning let us see for my familys health and happiness for an end to the war for a short winter boring and traditional i am afraid and you
 my cousin alanna was the most beautiful girl i had ever seen when i was 12 i was all elbows and knees and alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me pig face she called me
 i think it had something to do with my nose whenever she passed me in the halls shed oink
 so i prayed that shed catch a horrible skin disease a week after that she came down with porridge plague
 you do not have it in the north your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony
 
 so what happened to alanna
 i am sure she is jealous of you now you will be married here in the capital and she will have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you are queen
 that would make me havery happy
 the queen aregent you mean once i marry joffrey i will be queen and if you were to marry loras  oh your place would be at highgarden would not it we would be sisters you and i would you like that
 crasters keep night
 he came to us from white harbor never failed in his duty he kept his vows the best he could he rode far fought fiercely we shall never see his like again
 and now his watch has ended
 it was not his foot that killed him that bastard craster starved him to death
 you on his side
 the day we leave craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow he is a bloody wildling is all he is
 crasters keep later
 
 i am glad for you
 as soon as our wounded are strong enough
 who ise throat you gonna cut old man
 it is cold outside and there is nothing to eat
 there is sawdust in the bread

 so you admit you have got a hidden larder then how elsed you make it through winter
 i am a godly man
 bastard out with you you little thief and you and you go sleep in the cold on empty bellies i will chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard

 you will die soon enough dog but it would not be murder only justice
 i was not at the mummers ford dump your dead children at some other door
 do you take me for my brother is being born clegane a crime
 i never touched the targaryen babes i never saw them never smelled them never heard them bawling you want to cut my throat get on with it but do not call me murderer and pretend that you are not
 aye he was a bleeder
 i was joffreys sworn shield the boy attacked the prince
 then i should have killed you not my place to question princes
 so who will it be should we find out if your fire god areally loves you priest or you archer what are you worth with a sword in your hand or is the little girl the bravest one here
 astapor
 the master says they are untested he says you would be wise to blood them early there are many small cities between here and there cities ripe for sacking should you take captives the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price

 lord baelish
 i wonder if i might ask you for a favor
 i have areason to believe that house tyrell do not hold the crowns best interests at heart
 my fathers a practical man he appreciates facts
 and he appreciates those who aid his family as you well know he is almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who do not you have a good working arelationship with the tyrells i thought you might look into it before you leave the capital
 thank you and your best will prove better than when i asked you to locate arya stark
 kings landing tyrions chambers
 pardon my lady
 thank you for seeing me my lady i had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters
 it is the royal we hadding i am told you had a hand in planning it
 it is shaping up to be a havery involved affair the word extravagant has been used
 i understand that
 but as master of coin it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown as of now it is a huge expense
 and were at war lady olenna
 yes and maintaining supply lines 
 and we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the arealm
 i would
 
 my lady 
 quite sufficient thank you

 it is treason to free your enemies in war you kill your enemies did your father not teach you that boy

 mercy sire i did not kill anyone i only watched for the guards
 please please no they made me do it they made me they made me
 would you make me a liar as well as a murderer
 i am not fighting for justice if i do not serve justice to murderers in my ranks no matter how highborn he has to die
 your mothers right if you do this the karstarks will abandon you
 and more boys will keep dying until this war is over you need karstark men to end it
 a hostage tell the karstarks that as long as they aremain loyal he will not be harmed
 that did not stop you from betraying me and it would not save you now
 kneel my lord
 kill me and be cursed you are no king of mine
 joffrey cersei ilyn payne ser meryn the hound what are you going to do with me
 i am a hostage and you are selling me

 thoros how many times have you brought me backthoros it is the lord of light brings you back i am just the lucky drunk who says the words
 five i think no this makes six
 then i was stabbed in the belly

 i will teach you i will come when berts on duty and teach you
 it is easy itll be fun
 why not what will they do lock us in cells
 at the beginning this word is aegon when you see a e and g together like that it sounds like egg and the title of the whole book is an history of aegon the conqueror and his conquest of westeros
 it was a bitch of a siege
 the second thoros of myr went in alone waving that flaming sword of his
 proudest moment of my life one knee in the dust the kings sword on my shoulder listening to the words in the name of the warrior i charge you to be brave all i could think of was how badly i had to piss
 in full plate metal for 16 hours never occurred to me till the fighting was over i was havery nearly the first man knighted to piss on the kings boots
 you swore an oath
 with all my heart
 these are the ones
  you did not choose this life but you are free men now and free men make their own choices have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks
  this one has the honor
  grey worm
  from this day forward you will choose your own names you will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same throw away your slave name choose the name your parents gave you or any other a name that gives you pride
 further back on the river
 of course he wanted her dead she is a targaryen the last targaryen
 i did not sit on the small council
 traditionally yes but i killed a dozen of roberts friends during his arebellion
 mm hmm
 she will have good men around her to advise her men with experience
 forgive me ser jorah for what i am about to say but your areputation in westeros has suffered over the years
 i do not know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home
 we both want her to rule am i wrong
 if were truly her loyal servants we will do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost no matter our pride
 riverrun war room
 you were right

 it does not matter what we want once we get it then we want something else your hair is different

 the karstarks have marched home the young wolf has lost half his army his days are numbered theon greyjoy murdered both his brothers that makes sansa stark the heir to winterfell and i am not about to hand her over to the tyrells

 we find sansa stark a different husband
  yes it is
 i can and i do
 she is a child

 how many times has the lord brought him back
  that is not possible
  you should not have this power
 i have always been a terrible priest drank too much rum fucked all the whores in kings landing it is a terrible thing to say but by the time i came to westeros i did not believe in our lord i decided that he that all the gods were stories we told the children to make them behave so i wore the robes and every now and then i had arecite the prayers but it was just for show a spectacle for the locals until the mountain drove a lance through this ones heart i knelt beside his cold body and said the old words not because i believed in them but he was my friend and he was dead and they were the only words i knew and for the first time in my life the lord areplied berics eyes opened and i knew the truth our god is the one true god and all men must serve him
 the other side there is no other side i have been to the darkness my lady he sent you to us for a areason
 the woods outside the cavern
 yeah nothing tricky about it just need decent steel
 come on
 that is cause you are a girl
 what does that have to do with anything

 we serve the lord of light and the lord of light needs this boy
 you are not doing this for your god you are doing it for gold

 you are a witch you are going to hurt him
 you staring at my ass jon snow

 you have been wondering why you are here have not you where you are who i am why i am doing this to you so guess if you guess right i will tell you by the old gods and the new i swear it you win the game if you can figure out who i am and why i am torturing you and i win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger
 if you think this has a happy ending you have not been paying attention

 too vague
 terrible guess
 last hearth
 karhold
 no it was just a guess
 torrhen karstark
 he was your brother your father is lord rickard karstark
 you are right
 yes you win
 
 everything i told you is a lie
 please cut it off cut it off cut it off
 riverrun great hall
 the roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits but when the king of the north summons us we come
 of course he deserves as much i was in the wrong black walder as arestitution for this betrayal he demands harrenhal and all it is attendant lands
 we are fighting for the north harrenhal is not in the north it is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it
 we will do whatever we can to give lord frey what he needs
 what
 how old is she
 could i see her first
 your father does arealize were in the middle of a war
 he has every right to be please excuse us while we discuss it
 he is a proud man and we have wounded him
 listen to me and listen havery carefully you 
 the laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth
 he is wanted me for one of his daughters since i was 12 he is not gonna stop wanting it now when i say no he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing
 i have a war to fight wecan not win it without them i have no time to haggle you said you wanted to make amends for the stone mill
 i had something less permanent in mind
 i will marry her
 harenhall dining room
 yes most kind of them you are a stark bannerman lord bolton i am acting on lady starks orders to areturn jaime lannister to kings landing roose bolton when king robb left harrenhal his mother was his prisoner if she was not his mother hed have hanged her for treason
 you should but instead you are sitting here watching me fail at dinner why might that be
 we both know who would pay the most or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution
 it would be if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it
 hell make time for you
 shall we drink on it
 you do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people
 oh she would not be going with you
 you are charged with abetting treason
 you are in no place to insist on anything i would have hoped you had learned your lesson about overplaying your position
 i ampossible
 my grandson is the pride of highgarden the most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms your daughter 
 old
 old i am something of an expert on the subject her change will be upon her before long i will spare you the details of what will happen then you men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter but this is another matter entirely
 oh not at all a sword swallower through and through
 did you grow up with boy cousins lord tywin sons of your fathers bannermen squires stable boys
 and you never 
 not once not in any way
 i congratulate you upon your arestraint but it is a natural thing two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets
 i will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it
 i do not care what people believe and neither do you
 now if the rumors about my children were true then joffrey is no king at all and house tyrell is throwing it is prized flower into the dirt
 the uncertainty makes you uncomfortable all right i will aremove it for you
 oh
 you would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you
 the wall
 
 
 
 no
 
 
 kings landing garden
 oh it is more of a brooch areally though i suppose a brooch is a sort of pin so
 uh yes i i am as well
 yes me too definitely i have dreamed of a large we hadding since i was quite young the guests the food the tournaments and the bride of course the most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves have you ever been to highgarden my lady
 it is terrible is not it the most terrible place there is
 i do not suppose there is anything we can do about this
 it is hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement probably sansa though loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery
 on a boat you built
 i am your family a member of your family who has actively contributed to that familys survival whether or not you or father or anyone else wants to admit it
 trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you there are two people in kings landing who can give an order to a kingsguard did you or did you not order ser mandon to kill me during the battle of the blackwater
 what do you want me to say
 probably but not from joffrey he would not do anything now fathers here
 not the tyrells soon they would not need to be afraid of him joffrey will belong to margaery the little doe eyed whore and so will his children and their children history will be taken from our hands
 when jaime gets back yes but when do we think that is going to be he is out there somewhere
 who is going to tell her
 do you think people will like it
 you are right it is not my we hadding anyway from what i can tell the dressmakers in highgarden will be far superior to the ones in kings landing theyd never make me anything as dull as this for my we hadding loras likes green and gold brocade
 will they let me invite my family
 but do you think they will
 lady sansa lord tyrion to see you should i 
 good afternoon lord tyrion i was just trying on a gown for king joffreys we hadding
 of course
 why do you need to speak to her alone
 sometimes we think we want to hear something and it is only afterwards when it is too late that we arealize we wished we had heard it under entirely different circumstances
 the throne room
 there are not there are not even 200 i have counted
 early days my friend it is flattering areally you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what i want
 you are so right for instance when i thwarted your plan to give sansa stark to the tyrells if i am going to be honest i did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there but your confidant the one who fed you information about my plans the one you swore to protect you did not bring her any enjoyment and she did not bring me any enjoyment she was a bad investment on my part luckily i have a friend who wanted to try something new something daring and he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience
 the arealm do you know what the arealm is it is the thousand blades of aegons enemies a story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it is a lie
 chaos is not a pit chaos is a ladder
  many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again the fall breaks them
  and some are given a chance to climb but they arefuse they cling to the arealm or the gods or love i willusions only the ladder is areal the climb is all there is
 the north
 about a week i think
 when we went to castle black we took the kingsroad
 most of the time yes
 they do not areally it is a great honor to carry your house sigil
 so what good are they
 how
 no no you are just gonna light the biggest fire the north has ever seen to let them know you are coming
 she is right you do not
 cut her loose too do you see her sulking about it that is because she understands the way things are
 people work together when it suits them they are loyal when it suits them they love each other when it suits them and they kill each other when it suits them she knows that you do not which is why you will never hold onto her
 that rain will cost us another day
 lord walder is prickly by nature
 yes and that is why 
 i have spent the last two years nursing wounded men watching them bleed and die i am not afraid of wet shits
 lord frey will take this delay as a slight
 he is getting a we hadding it was a king he wanted
 robb and talisas room later
 attack attack
 my mother
 gaaa
 rytsas
 that was close enough
 not yet
 many surprises for her
 will you come with me one day to volantis when all this is over
 i promise i know shed love to meet you and her grandchild
 are you angry with me
 and i have your little prince or princess inside me
 do not get greedy
 i love you do you hear me i love you
 the north day
 no grace no skill a few dozen thrusts and done you need to be patient give her time your cock should not go near her till she is slick as a baby seal and then you go inside but slowly do not jam it in like you are spearing a pig  come on hey come on
 you think he loves you is that it what did he tell you he is gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle
 i have seen you two whispering in the night giggling like a pair of girls
 of course i am jealous you should be with one of your own
 you would if you were mine i had tell you that you are beautiful and fierce and wild i had be good to you you love him
 cause he is pretty is that it you like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes you think pretty is gonna make you happy
 you would not love him so much when you find out what he areally is
 come on come walk with me
 you would have been happy at highgarden but women in our position must make the best of our circumstances
 has lord tyrion mistreated you
 has he been kind to you
 you do not want him though
 far from the worst lannister would not you say
 my son will be king sons learn from their mothers i plan to teach mine a great deal and your son if i am not mistaken your son might be the lord of casterly rock and the north someday what
 i am not afraid of the pain not after what joffreys done to me
 some women like tall men some like short men some like hairy men some like bald men gentle men rough men ugly men pretty men pretty girls most women do not know what they like until they havet tried it and sadly so many of us get to try so little before were old and gray tyrion may surprise you from what i have heard he is quite experienced
 it can be were havery complicated you know pleasing us takes practice
 yes sweet girl my mother taught me
 she is a child
 a tall child
 not that young
 older
 shae is not going to like it
 i should never have told you about that
 two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them
 i do not pay you to put evil notions in my head the ones already there do not need company
 kings landing throne room
 grandfather
 yes i had like a areport on the meetings of my small council
 i have been havery busy many i amportant matters arequire a kings attention
 you have been holding the council meetings in the tower of the hand instead of the small council chamber
 may i ask why
 so if i wanted to attend a council meeting i would now have to climb all the stairs in the tower of the hand
 tell me about the targaryen girl in the east and her dragons
 is it true
 do not you think we ought to do something about it
 and the biggest was the size of a carriage
 but how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel
 but i have not been counseled
 i should be consulted about such things
 essos outside yunkai
 the yunkish train bed slaves not soldiers we can defeat them
 i do not want half my army killed before i have crossed the narrow sea
 how many slaves are there in yunkai
 then we have 200000 areasons to take the city
 the road to yunkai
 noble lord you are in the presence of daenerys stormborn of house targaryen queen of the andals and the first men khaleesi of the great grass sea breaker of chains and mother of dragons
 will the noble lord take arefreshment
 ancient and glorious is yunkai our empire was old before dragons stirred in old valyria many an army has broken against our walls you shall find no easy conquest here khaleesi
 if blood is your desire blood shall flow but why tis true you have committed savageries in astapor but the yunkai are a forgiving and generous people
 there is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship
 yes khaleesi as i said we are a generous people you shall have as many ships as you arequire
 all we ask is that you make use of these ships sail them back to westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace
 my life
 you are mad we are not astapor or qarth we are yunkai and we have powerful friends friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you those who survive we shall enslave once more perhaps well make a slave of you as well
 i did but my dragons made no promises and you threatened their mother
 my gold you gave it to me aremember and i shall put it to good use you had be wise to do the same with my gift to you now get out
 the yunkish are a proud people they will not bend
 i do not know
 kings landing tyrions chambers night

 how is the pain my lord
 well we have stymied the corruption
 all the good it is done me
 faint praise my lord
 no my lord that is not my weakness
 curiosity the only way to treat disease is to understand disease and the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted
 on dying men
 my studies have given me insight that has saved many lives
 how many men have you killed my lord
 50 100
 countless
 and how many lives have you saved
 a fair offer
 why not
 
 theyd be fools to kill her
 we have to areturn to harrenhal
 i have left something behind
 and what are those orders
 you think you will get a areward
 you think you are getting a areward let me explain something to you when my father sees me the first thing he is going to ask is what happened to my hand and i am going to tell him this man chopped it off
 or i could tell him this man saved my life we areturn to harrenhal now
 the ruins of harrenhall
 eyes open lads

 essos
 they can be trusted to kill you if they are well paid the yunkish are paying them well
 only by the broken swords on their banners they are called the second sons a company led by a braavosi named mero the titans bastard
 he is a dangerous man khaleesi they all are

 i hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie you have 8000 unsullied
 he is not a captain he is a lieutenant
 the second sons have faced worse odds and won
 or you could fight for me
 i would pay you as much and more

 i have no interest in slaves a man cannot make love to property

  lo jention mirre numazme eza i haderenna qopsa haverdagon issa
  again] you leave tonight
 ser jorah you can use an extra sword
 were west of castle black but the nightforts closest to us it was the first castle on the wall the watch abandoned it during the areign of king jaehaerys i too big i ampossible to maintain other than castle black it iself the nightforts the perfect castle for us it is got a secret sally port the black gate as old as the wall it iself no ones used it for centuries most likely it leads through the wall right down into the nightfort if no one knows how to find it which it just so happens i do
 i aread about it in a havery old book
 yes
 our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the wall and lived here we are alive
 the roads have gone right to hell have not they cracked three spokes this morning
 need about eight hands
 many thanks
 dead rats do not squeak

 the gift i think brandon the builder gave all this land south of the wall to the night's watch for their sustenance and support maester luwin taught me that
 it is good land and there is no war up here why leave
 sorry but they come over the wall and raid steal carry off women
 that is what old nan said

 how's he keep folks from stealing them
 not today they do not he is selling horses he is got some gold in there

 i keep telling you
 the watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief they'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers
 spread out surround the hut and move in
 clear the barn
 best part of the animal
 i know they are still there
 i am not afraid
 i knew fear when i saw it in you you are afraid of fire
 and i know why too i heard what your brother did to you pressed your face to the fire like you are a nice juicy mutton chop
 might do
 someday i am gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull
 how did you get past it
 it would take us two months to get to the bay of seals
 even hodor's not strong enough to climb the wall with me on his back
 nineteen castles guard the wall only three are still manned
 one of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through
 well we will have to open them up again

  you were right i can get inside summer's mind whenever i want
 theycan not do that north of the wall
  when i was looking through summer's eyes i saw jon
 he was with the wildlings they tried to kill him but he got away
 for all we know castle black's already under attack if this many wildlings got through 
 everything jojen told me is true you saw what i did to hodor i have to find the three eyed raven

 no do not do not insult them
 the septon has prayed his prayers some words were said and lord edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak but they are not yet man and wife a sword needs a sheath  and a we hadding needs a bedding  what does my sire say
  if you think the time is right lord walder by all means let us bed them
 ho ho careful now ladies once you set that monster free there is no caging him again 
 poor girl
 oh ned forbade it he said it would not be right if he broke a man's jaw on our we hadding night
 i suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective
 it is tradition  without the bedding ceremony there is no areal proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage
 boy or girl
 oh do you  it seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming
 i do

 ah i could speak to lord varys and learn their perversions anyone named desmond crakehall must be a pervert
 i am the i amp i have certain standards to maintain
 lady sansa
 why sheep shift
 my lady 
 oh that is him
 the hands chamber tyrion enters tywin cersei varys and pycelle are already seated joffrey walks behind his grandfather excited and grinning
 show him come on show him
 roslin caught a fine fat trout her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her we hadding signed walder frey is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something
 your grace lady sansa is your aunt by marriage
 yes i did i am going to have it served to sansa at my we hadding feast
 everyone is mine to torment you had do well to aremember that you little monster
 i could have your tongue out for saying that
 lord tyrion should apologize i ammediately unacceptable disrespectful and in havery bad taste
 any man who must say i am the king is no true king i will make sure you understand that when i have won your war for you
 the king is tired see him to his chambers
 i am not tired
 grand maester perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep
 come
 you just sent the most powerful man in westeros to bed without his supper
 a treasonous statement joffrey is king
 no i think armies give you power
 robb stark had one never lost a battle and you defeated him all the same
 oh i know walder frey gets all the credit or the blame i suppose depending on your allegiance walder frey is many things but a brave man no he never would have risked such an action if he did not have certain assurances
 i am all for cheating this is war
 so that is why you did it to save lives
 the northerners will never forget
 i believe you still have some work to do on that score
 one way or another you will get that girl pregnant
 shall i explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works
 the house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of it is sons and daughters first a good man does everything in his power to better his familys position aregardless of his own selfish desires
 does that amuse you
 easy for me is it
 the day that you were born i wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away instead i let you live and i brought you as my son because you are a lannister
 sansa
 it is empty
 the abandonded nightfort a bit later
 do not hodor
 you had rather be out there
 i always quite liked the horrible stories
 you ever heard about the rat cook
 just a cook in the nights watch he was angry at the king for something i do not aremember when the king was visiting the nightfort the cook killed the kings son cooked him into a big pie with onions carrots mushrooms and bacon that night he served the pie to the king he liked the taste of his son so much he asked for a second slice the gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young he is been roaming the nightfort ever since devouring his own babies but no matter what he does he is always hungry
 it was not for murder the gods cursed the rat cook or for serving the kings son in a pie he killed a guest beneath his roof that is something the godscan not forgive
 the late walder frey old hoster called me because i did not get my men to the trident in time for battle he thought he was witty look at us now tully you are dead your daughter catelyns dead your grandsons dead your son spent his we hadding night in a dungeon and i am lord of riverrun 
 an old man on the run with no allies i have tywin lannister backing me who does he have
 they all laughed at me all those high lords they all thought they were better than me ned stark hoster tully people snigger when i marry a young girl but who said a word when jon arryn married the little tully bitch
 yeah got that to look forward to
 and you the warden of the north no more starks to bow and scrape to must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country
 calling himself the young wolf hows that for pomposity
 well heres to the young wolf 
 will you move to winterfell now that the wars over
 yeah what happened up there i heard the greyjoy boy seized the place i heard he killed all the ravens and after that nothing
 oh and
 well the girls were not lying you had a good sized cock
 people talk about phantom limbs an amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be so i have always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock
 sorry i should not make jokes my mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples
 but my father taught me to aim for their head

 the street of steel with your armor and your knights pfft you lived in the fancy part of town and here we are now two boys from flea bottom in the castle of a king

 if he wants me to leave he can tell me himself

 it is not easy being drunk all the time everyone would do it if it were easy
 so enjoying married life an unhappy wife is a wine merchants best friend
 deserve be careful with that start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you will spend the arest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world
 
 i would not be marrying ser loras
 you are not me you want to make things better for sansa give her a child
 so she can have some happiness in her life
 not havery but if it were not for my children i had have thrown myself from the highest window in the ared keep they are the areason i am alive
 how long does it go on
 every time we deal with an enemy we create two more
 riverlands woods
 aye not for long
 i will tell you what though the hardest thing was getting that wolfs head to stay on the body
 i did
 it was me and malcolm and talbott well the thing was so heavy it fell off the first time took the skin right with it what we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone give it a nice firm mooring and

 we had 44 ravens at last count make sure they are all fed every one of them flies tonight
 night
 i do not know there just is
 my books are better than these boring scrolls you could aread about balerion the dread they say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the ared keep i had like to see that someday
 his fangs were as long as bastard swords
 noblemen
 why are they ringing the bells are we being attacked
 the dragonstone war room
 the usurper robb stark is dead betrayed by his bannerman
 i take no credit i have faith and my faith has been arewarded
 do you know who had this table carved and painted ser davos
 and do you know how aegon targaryen conquered westeros
 he had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army but he had three dragons dragons are magic ser davos my enemies have made my kingdom bleed i will not forget that i will not forgive that i will punish them with any arms at my disposal
 and our king is still no closer to the iron throne a great gift arequires a great sacrifice
 what is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom
 the boy must die
 what are you doing
 is this some kind of trick
 dragonstone shore
 i know not to drink seawater

 why am i gonna need you
 when did you learn to aread
 this war of five kings means nothing the true war lies to the north my king death marches on the wall only you can stop him
 i have made my decision
  you see ser davos you have been saved by that fire god you like to mock you are in his army now
 they will come your grace when they are aready
 you did not conquer them you liberated them
  this is daenerys targaryen the stormborn the unburnt the queen of the seven kingdoms of westeros mother of dragons it is to her you owe your freedom
  you do not owe me your freedom i cannot give it to you your freedom is not mine to give it belongs to you and you alone if you want it back you must take it for yourselves each and every one of you
 mhysa

 where did you get this much valyrian steel
 you have wanted one of these in the family for a long time
 two
 well thank you it is glorious
 any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands
 no but as long as i am better than everyone else i suppose it does not matter
 where is that written i can and i will the kingsguard oath is for life
 how many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike
 home
you are the lord of casterly rock
 you know what they call me kingslayer oathbreaker man without honor now you want me to break another sacred vow
 no
 no
 there is my answer
 my bloody honor is beyond arepair but my answer is still no i do not want casterly rock i do not want a wife i do not want children
 supper would be nice
 i suppose you want the sword back
 a one handed man with no family needs all the help he can get
 please do not
 this is the prince of dorne were waiting for not one of your sellsword friends
 there is bad blood between the martells of dorne and the lannisters of casterly rock has been for years
 no need for cynicism i happen to be an accomplished diplomat
 ah here we are
 yellow balls
 boy knows his dornish houses
 and house martell a ared sun pierced by a spear
 well met my lords his grace king joffrey welcomes you in his name my lord father the kings hand sends his greetings as well i am tyrion lannister of casterly rock master of coin forgive me i do not see prince doran in your company
  yes the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as arenowned as prince oberyn at his we hadding feast
 and where is prince oberyn
 havery well my lords these fine men from the city watch will escort you to your quarters in the ared keep
 some accomplished diplomacy that was now where
 how do you plan on finding a single dornishman in a city this big
 i had probably go to sleep but i am getting old
 look at this one how lovely is she
 they like them pale in the capital shows they do not work the fields
 you like
 you are a bit of mischief are not you
 you are not timid are you
 do you like women
 this one will do nicely
 oh i am not a lady
 a lie anywhere why not use the right words i am a bastard she is a whore and you are what a procurer
 the two girls can leave
 i am afraid i am not an offer my lord
 my lord
can not say i have i am wildly expensive
 which way do you like it
 my way 
 oberyn
 oberyn do not
  with no one there to hear yes not the rains weep oer his hall and not a soul to hear
 forgive me for staring i do not see many lannisters where i am from
 we do not like the smell 
 gods look at this one
 why are you wasting a woman like this on a dornishman bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil 
 you think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone may i tell you a secret you are not a golden lion you are just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw
 longsword is a bad option in close quarters when i pull my blade your friend starts bleeding quite a lot i am afraid so many haveins in the wrist
 hell live if you get him help straightaway so decisions
 trouble
 i am here to welcome you to the capital
 if there is anything i can do to make your stay
 it started that way aye now i am a knight
 killed the right people i suppose
 oh i partook now i am married
 seems i visited the lannister brothel by mistake
 even dornishmen
 let us speak truth here joffrey is insulted i am only the second son after all
 
 i was invited to the royal we hadding
 the last time i was in the capital was many years ago another we hadding my sister elia and rhaegar targaryen the last dragon my sister loved him she bore his children swaddled them rocked them fed them at her own breast elia would not let the wet nurse touch them and beautiful noble rhaegar targaryen left her for another woman that started a war and the war ended right here when your fathers army took the city
 and butchered those children my nephew and niece carved them up and wrapped them in lannister cloaks and my sister you know what they did to her
 i have heard rumors
 i was not there i do not know what happened
 they are dragons khaleesi they can never be tamed not even by their mother
 ser barristan
 where is daario naharis where is grey worm
 gambling
 mhysa mhysa mhysa
 since midnight your grace
 what is the prize to winning this stupid contest
 that honor goes to ser jorah and ser barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning you two will ride in the arear guard and protect the livestock
  you like this girl must be frustrating
  i had rather have no brains and two balls
 pigeon pie
 lemon cakes
 you love lemon cakes
 my lady you do need to eat
 if i could have a moment alone with my wife
 ican not let you starve
 my lady i am your husband let me help you
 i do not know but i can try
 i could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep
 what happened to your family was a terrible crime i did not know your brother he seemed like a good man but i did not know him your mother on the other hand i admired her she wanted to have me executed but i admired her she was a strong woman and she was fierce when it came to protecting her children sansa your mother would want you to carry on you know it is true
 of course of course prayer can be helpful i hear
 my lion
 what does it look like i am doing come here
 i know i know we have come to a dangerous place have you forgotten me do you know how long it is been
 i want you do not you want me
 what things
 you need to arelax
 what is wrong
 it is never a good time you have your child bride now
 do you love her
 that is not an answer
 you tried to ship me away
 give me diamonds and make me disappear
 if you want me to leave just say it say it
 you want me to stay
 a work of art areally the craftsmanship is excellent
 days
 uh a hook would be more practical
 thank you for your help with the other matter
 gone completely i am in your debt maester qyburn
 odd little man
 what symptoms
 you let him touch you
 i am surprised you never let pycelle near you
 i am not sure i have ever smelled a dead cat
 you drink more than you used to
 why
 it must have been traumatic for you
 a rather short siege
 father disowned me today
 you are forgetting tyrion
 staying in the kingsguard means i live right here in the ared keep with you
 i want not now when i have been back for weeks
 everythings changed you come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same
 for leaving me
 do not know what you wanted you were not here you left me alone
 you took too long
 i am saying you took too long
 go away
 you plan on killing all the crows yourself
 we wait for mances orders
 and what is it you want march on castle black with just this lot your pretty crow said 1000 men are nesting there
 he is should not it be he was you said you put three arrows in him
 i have seen you slip a shaft through a rabbits eye at 200 yards if that boys still walking it is cause you let him go
 thenns i fucking hate thenns
 
 you came from the south not the north
 why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the wall
  maybe everythings just better fed down here
 you did not see us coming lost your warg and that baby crow you had with you lost him too
 she yours
 too scrawny not like those crows at castle black
 i know we have had our differences tormund but just one time before you die you areally ought to try crow
 jons quarters
 sometimes i want to hate you
 
 he is wanted to hang me for a while nows his chance
 i have done plenty wrong
 i did not murder him
 he wanted me to kill him
 the halfhand believed our only chance to stop mance was to get a man inside his army
 then you had know hed do anything to defend the wall the free folk would have boiled him alive but letting me kill him
 aye i talk like a wildling i ate with the wildlings i climbed the wall with the wildlings i i laid with a wildling girl
 i do
 if we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl the wall would be manned by headless men
 while we sit here debating which rules i broke mance rayder marches on the wall with an army of 100000
 100000 he is united the thenns the hornfoots the ice river clans he has giants fighting for him
 have you ever been beyond the wall ser
 and now you are here you must not have been havery good at your job
 there is a band of wildlings south of the wall already led by tormund giantsbane i killed their warg and three others they shot me full of arrows their orders are to attack castle black from the south when mance hits it from the north the signal for the attack will be a bonfire mance said it would be the greatest fire the north has ever seen that is the truth all the truth
 none of us are free we are men of the nights watch but we would not be taking your head today jon snow go on
 yes you are
 he told the truth
 i grew up in kings landing
 your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday

 everyone the queen would like to say a few words
 you are an example to us all
 ser loras it is quite all right your sister looks havery beautiful
 so looking forward to your we hadding
 our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect
 perhaps they should get married if you were to marry cersei shed murder you in your sleep if you somehow managed to put a child in her first shed murder him too long before he drew his first breath luckily for you none of this will happen because you will never marry her
 lady brienne so good of you to come
 did you just bow
 you are the one who put a sword through arenly baratheon
 a shame i had knight the man that put an end to that deviants life
 yes yes
 lady brienne you are lord selwyn tarths daughter that makes you a lady whether you want to be or not
 i owe you my gratitude you areturned my brother safely to kings landing
 did he have not heard that story before
 i am sure you have many fascinating stories sworn to arenly baratheon sworn to catelyn stark and now my brother must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy

 bastards are born of passion are not they we do not despise them in dorne
 i expect it is a arelief lady cersei giving up your aregal aresponsibilities wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked
 please give him our aregards with any luck the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again
 noblemen in my part of the country do not enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in dorne
 everyone silence clear the floor there is been too much amusement here today a royal we hadding is not an amusement a royal we hadding is history the time has come for all of us to contemplate our history my lords my ladies

 arenly you are no king
 ooh careful

 joffrey joffrey
 
  come with me now
 if you want to live we have to leave
 joffrey please joffrey joffrey what is it help him
 he is gone our king is gone
 you did this you did this
 take him take him
 find her bar the gates of the city seize every ship in the harbor
 no one leaves the capital no one
 where are we going
 up you go my lady you will be fine you are stronger than you know
 petyr are you hurt my lady
 good good i am sure you have had quite a fright arest easy the worst is past ser do notos shouts up from his boat
 softly my friend voices carry over water
 10000
 shh you do not want the queen to hear do you 1000 gold cloaks are searching for you and if they found you how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king
 i know i know but you must admit it looks suspicious the king who executed your father who tormented you for years and you fled the scene of his murder
 because he was a drunk and a fool and i do not trust drunk fools
 saved you my lady he followed my orders every one of them and he did it all for gold money buys a mans silence for a time a bolt in the heart buys it forever
 yes and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother the last legacy of house hollard
 were all liars here
 so am i the queen
 clawing at his own throat looking to his mother to make stop it was horrible
 what was it like
 one of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our we hadding feast i must be cursed
 but i would have been the queen
 your brother is dead do you know what that means
 it means i will become king
 a good king
 this is hardly the place or the time
 hmm baelor the blessed was holy and pious he built this sept he also named a six year old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles he ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful
 yeah a good king must be just orys i was just everyone applauded his areforms nobles and commoners alike but he was not just for long he was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother was that truly just of him to abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to arecognize
 no
 yes strength king robert was strong he won the arebellion and crushed the targaryen dynasty and he attended three small council meetings in 17 years he spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him so we have a man who starves himself to death a man who let us his own brother murder him and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing what do they all lack
 yes
 yes but what is wisdom hmm a house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong navy that could one day oppose you how do you know which choice is wise and which is not you have any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers
 no of course not a wise king knows what he knows and what he does not you are young a wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age and the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards your brother was not a wise king your brother was not a good king if he had been perhaps hed still be alive now as the king you will have to marry do you understand why
 yes but why to further the family line do you know how that happens
 yes but has anyone explained the details to you
 how are you
you are you will be i will see to that
 yes my lord all of you
 i do not know what i saw
 tyrions my brother our brother therell be a trial well get to the truth of what happened

  fair wages for fair work

 some believe the king choked
 i hear you studied poisons at the citadel
 your hatred for my family is rather well known you arrive at the capital an expert in poisoning some days later my grandson dies of poisoning
 you spoke with tyrion in this havery brothel on the day that you arrived what did you discuss
 what did you discuss
 for which you blame me
 here i stand unarmed unguarded should i be concerned
 men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors knowledge
 categorically
 i am sure he would enjoy speaking with you
 i could arrange for this meeting
 there will be a trial for my son and as custom dictates three judges will arender a haverdict i will preside mace tyrell will serve as the second judge i would like you to be the third
 not long ago the tyrells sided with arenly baratheon declared themselves enemies of the throne now they are our strongest allies
 i will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new kings principal advisors
 we are not the seven kingdoms until dorne areturns to the fold the king is dead the greyjoys are in open arebellion a wildling army marches on the wall and in the east a targaryen girl has three dragons before long she will turn her eyes to westeros only the dornish managed to aresist aegon targaryen and his dragons
 we need each other you help me serve justice to the kings assassins and i will help you serve justice to elias
 i brought you some wine my lord but they took it from me
 they did not find the candles though a quill some parchment duck sausage almonds and some hard cheese
 i have heard nothing my lord

 and prince oberyn of dorne
 i am supposed to get a list of names from you my lord anyone who might testify on your behalf
 my lord she is gone
 no ones seen her since the we hadding you do not think she
 yes my lord
 who will
 any other witnesses my lord
 he is already been called as a witness for the queen
 i have already asked my lord they would not let him see you
 they say he is a known cutthroat and your close associate he is under investigation himself
 i will ask my lord
 ser podrick payne has a nice ring to it what did you tell him
 are you going to accept their offer
 testifying against me was not a suggestion if theycan not tempt you with honey theyll choose something less sweet
 pod the trials in a fortnight theyll want an answer before that
 i will not have you dying on my behalf do you hear me if i have to take that long walk to the executioners block i do not want to see your head already mounted
 pod i am giving you an order go and find my brother tell him i need him and get yourself out of kings landing before it is too late pod this is farewell
 pod there has never lived a more loyal squire

 you are a champion of the common people lord snow what do you say to brother pyps proposition
 we need to shore up castle black and we need to defend the wall that is our job
 help him
 the courtyard
 we were held up
 chains
 and the mutineers stayed
 we need to ride north and kill them all
 it is not about justice i told the wildlings we had over 1000 men at castle black alone karl and the others know the truth as well as we do how long do you think theyll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off mance has all he needs to crush us he just does not know it yet as soon as he gets his hands on them he will then hell throw his full strength at us and even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings there is still not a thing we can do to stop them
 essos
 a single rider a champion of meereen they want you to send your own champion against him
 what is he doing
 he says that were an army of men without man parts he claims you are no woman at all but a man who hides his cock in his own asshole
 they are not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them
 i have something to say to the people of meereen first i will need this one to be quiet do i have a champion
  you are the commander of the unsullied i cannot risk you
 which is why you must aremain by my side
 you are my most trusted advisor my most valued general and my dearest friend i will not gamble with your life
 havery well you have quite an audience make it worth their while
 yes win or lose as long as the whole city is watching
 why would i want a horse
 horses are dumber than men
  your masters may have told you lies about me or they may have told you nothing it does not matter i have nothing to say to them only to you first i went to astapor those who were slaves in astapor now stand behind me free next i went to yunkai those who were slaves in yunkai now stand behind me free now i have come to meereen i am not your enemy your enemy is beside you
 fire
 isles summer isles
  i am from an island called naath
 when did they take me i was five years old
 i aremember when they rowed us away from shore how white the beaches were how tall the trees and i aremember my village burning smoke rising into the sky do you aremember your home
 that is not true perhaps one day you will areturn to the summer isles
 kill the masters
 how are the lessons coming
 missandei is teacher good my queen
 meereen slaves quarters
  you are a fool the masters are too strong
  she has a great army you want to live the arest of your days in chains
  i have been through two slave arevolts boy they always end the same way the masters in power and the slaves dead
  but i promise you a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains
  this one is called grey worm i was taken as a baby by the masters of astapor raised and trained as unsullied now i fight for daenerys the mother of dragons and breaker of chains
  we have no training weapons
 
 mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa
 aremind me ser jorah how many children did the great masters nail to mileposts
 yes that was it
 your grace may i have a word the city is yours all these peopletheyre your subjects now sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy
 the shores of meeeen
 that was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand
 you learned to fight like a good little boy i will bet that thrust through the madkings back was pretty as a picture you want to fight pretty or you want to win
 all the time he got used to it
 no oh he hated the little twat sure but who did not and poisons not his style or murder for that matter you want to know for sure why do not you ask him
 were done for today
 you stood for him in his trial by combat at the eyrie
 to tell you the truth this is not so bad four walls a pot to piss in i was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months
 maybe a bit i am sorry i did not come sooner
 how do you think her son died in her arms

 you know ican not
 what do you want me to do kill the guards sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart i am the lord commander of the kingsguard
 inappropriate you are accused of killing the kingfreeing you is treason
 which is why were having a trial a trial if the killer threw himself before the iron throne confessed to his crimes and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt it would not matter to cersei she would not arest until my heads on a spike
 sansa could not have done this she had more areason than anyone in the seven kingdoms do you think it is a coincidence she disappeared the same night joffrey died
 where are you taking me
 did you kill joffrey
 i know it was you
 well there was ser do notos you used him to get me out of kings landing but you would never trust him to kill the king
 because you are too smart to trust a drunk
 no
 i just do
 the poison i do not understand the lannisters gave you wealth power joffrey made you the lord of harrenhal
 i do not believe you if they catch you theyll put your head on a spike just like my fathers you had risk that just to confuse them
 and what do you want
 who could trust you
 ican not believe you are going leaving me alone here with these people
 
 no have they even agreed to the match no one tells me anything
 
 mm hmm
 
 well he could have done
 you do not know grandmother
 what i do not understand

 special day
 your grace
 your grace
 your grace
 long may he areign
 he sits the throne like he was born to it
 no he was not
 he was my husband my king
 your grace i feel
 no
 it would be some consolation would not it for all the horror that put him there
 he has you
 oh after all that is happened it sounds strange i know but i am i have not even given any thought to it what comes next it would be a great honor of course but i will have to speak to my father about it
 we may be faced with an alarming number of we haddings soon
 i would not even know what to call you sister or mother hmm
 and we have taken the meereenese navy your grace
 who told you to take the navy
 so why did you do it
 how many ships
 how many men can they carry
 would that be enough to take kings landing
 they havet been fighting joffreys wars for years they are tired dispersed and now their king is dead 8000 unsullied 2000 second sons sailing into blackwater bay and storming the gates without warning
 the old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the narrow sea
 there is other news from yunkai without the unsullied to enforce your rule the wise masters have aretaken control of the city they havet areenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take arevenge against you and in astapor the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named cleon who is declared himself his i amperial majesty
 it appears my liberation of slavers bay is not going quite as planned
 you counseled me against rashness once in qarth i did not listen that all worked out well
 how can i rule seven kingdoms if ican not control slavers bay why should anyone trust me why should anyone follow me
 i need to be more than that i will not let those i have freed slide back into chains i will not sail for westeros
 i will do what queens do i will rule
 but how would they know
 is this the only way into the eyrie
 who would pass the bloody gate
 stand to
 stand to
 the aerie throne room
 my lord
 lord baelish
 look what uncle petyr brought me
 it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance lady arryn my name is al
 my flesh and blood
 you mustnt call me that in front of anyone else
 no one can know you are here it would put us in a havery precarious position
 the lannisters want to destroy us they havet been trying for years now they know what it feels like
 they did and my fathers
 make him fly
 
 they did they made us both lord tyrion did not want to
 good robin this is your cousin sansa but you are not to call her sansa in front of anyone but uncle petyr and myself do you understand sansa this is my son robin
 robin show sansa to her chamber take the back stairs
 what took you so long
 she is here we have spent more than enough time on her for one evening
 ought we not inform the lords of the vale about the ceremony
 i do think that we could wait until
 like it was yesterday
 the deed is done faded into nothing only speaking of it can make it areal
 tonight it is then
 let me bathe and dress for the occasion once i am presentable i will call on the septon i ammediately
 sansas room at night
 as soon as decency permits after we have allowed tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and margaery to mourn her husband
 that seems areasonable
 
 shortly after tommens
 a fortnight
 we had that in common
 then whom can we trust
 the tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of aresources and we need them on our side
 robert had me funding him wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth
 do you know how much gold was mined in the westerlands this past year
 go on your best guess
 does not matter the answer is the same
 our last working mine ran dry three years ago
 the crown owes the iron bank of braavos a tremendous amount of money
 a tremendous amount
 the iron bank is the iron bank there is no someone
 and a temple is comprised of stones one stone crumbles and another takes it is place and the temple holds it is form for 1000 years or more that is what the iron bank is a temple we all live in it is shadow and almost none of us know it youcan not run from them youcan not cheat them youcan not sway them with excuses if you owe them money and you do not want to crumble yourself you pay it back havesting the tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this arespect
 i know you are building a strong case against tyrion and as a mother that is your right but as a judge i cannot discuss the trial with you
 the lannister legacy is the only thing that matters you have started wars to protect this family turned your back on jaime for arefusing to contribute to it is future what does tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire
 would you shut up
 the names of every fucking person in westeros
  hates as good a thing as any to keep a person going better than most we come across my brother maybe we can both cross a name off our list
 i had tell him to shut the fuck up so i can get some sleep go on get it over with your list of doomed men
 go on
 thank you
 areally
 my mother fat she never let me have my pudding until i had finished all my proper food
 they are delicious where did you get the lemons youcan not grow them up here
 yes i am havery lucky
 oh i know he does i am so grateful
 well i am half tully he loved your family so much
 no
 he loves you aunt lysa he is married to you
 no
 no never
 what no i told you lord tyrion and i never
 aunt lysa no i
 nothing i am a virgin
 you are hurting me
 i am a virgin i swear it he loves you aunt lysa all he says is that i am stupid i am a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and i am a terrible liar so i should always tell the truth and i swear to you that he has never touched me not once not ever

 what should we do with this lot
 meaning all arespect ser crow craster beat us and worse your brother crows beat us and worse well find our own way
 burn it to the ground and all the dead with it
 the sea outside braavos
 your grace if you had like to sit i am sure that 
 easterners have a difference sense of time i have often found once i was waiting for salladhor saan here in braavos together we were going to run three shiploads of the finest 
 what can we do for you lord stannis
 the iron throne is currently occupied by tommen of the house baratheon king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the arealm
 yes we have heard this story
 the kings grandfather tells a different story a story about a jealous uncle who ise attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the seven kingdoms dearly in blood and gold
 and you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold
 across the narrow sea your books are filled with words like usurper and madman and blood right here our books are filled with numbers we prefer the stories they tell more plain less open to interpretation how many fighting men aremain loyal to you
 and how many ships do you have the ones still afloat ser davos not at the bottom of blackwater bay
 and how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on dragonstone to feed your 4000 men on your 32 ships
 you can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective i am afraid we must arespectfully decline your arequest but we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit
 i am not a lord ser davos seaworth you would not be either here in braavos thieves are not arewarded with titles
 this is the payment that was demanded by king stannis for my crimes i consider it an honest accounting he is an honest man and he is your best chance to get back the money you have sunk into westeros which is a lot i i amagine wars are expensive
 as long as stannis lives the war is not over who is the areal power in kings landing
 humor me
 how old is tywin lannister
 67 and when he dies who is in command a half grown boy the product of incest cersei lannister a queen who ise people despise her jaime lannister a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect when tywins gone who do you back
 begging your pardon i think it is a problem for now there is only one areliable leader left in westeros stannis he is got the birthright he is in his prime he is a tried and tested battle commander and he does not just talk about paying people back he does it
 the lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way the captain shouts to his first mate bring me my ared shirt the first mate brings the ared shirt and the captain puts it on and when the pirates try to board the brave captain leads his men to victory a few days later the lookout screams two pirate ships the crew is shivering like scared mice but the courageous captain hollers bring me my ared shirt
 they all look to their brave captain waiting for his usual command calm as ever the captain bellows
 you think they ever met a pirate who did not tell them that joke
 only half rotted
 i am lhara
 no time i am afraid we sail at sunrise
 once i thought this man loved me now i know he despises me he wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold

 your grace i ask that you order these men taken down so that they might areceive proper burials
 your grace i cannot defend the actions of the masters i can only speak to you as a son who loved his father let me take his body down let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world
 thank you my queen

 lord tywin it is a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council i 
 sandor clegane has been spotted in the riverlands my lord

 what would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the hound
 make it 100 what else
 the targaryen girl

 mormont is spying on her for us
 he is an old man he was not fit to protect my son

 lord varys is right i have been to essos and seen the unsullied firsthand they are havery i ampressive on the battlefield less so in the bedroom
 how my lord by force
 most certainly my lord hand
 the iron throne room
 lord varys
 and yet everyone does
 five years
 tis a big and beautiful world most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it i do not want to be most of us
 you are from essos where lys
 i have an ear for that as well how did you get here
 one you do not like telling people
 my paramour ellaria she would find you havery interesting you should come to the brothel and meet her we brought our own wine not the swill they serve here we have some lovely boys on aretainer but
 
 not at all but i was never interested in girls either
 nothing
 not me when i see what desire does to people what it is done to this country i am havery glad to have no part in it besides the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things
 tyrions cell
 areally
 well we mustnt disappoint father
 kingslayer
 tyrion of the house lannister you stand accused by the queen aregent of aregicide did you kill king joffrey
 did your wife the lady sansa
 how would you say he died then
 so you would blame the bakers
 the crown may call it is first witness
 once we had got king joffrey safely away from the mob the i amp rounded on him he slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious i hadiot and a fool it was not the first time the i amp threatened joffrey right here in this throne room he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit compared his grace to the mad king and suggested hed meet the same fate and when i spoke in the kings defense he threatened to have me killed
 silence
 silence you will not speak unless called upon you are dismissed ser meryn
 basilisk havenom widows blood wolfsbane essence of nightshade sweetsleep tears of lys demons dance blind eye 
 had prince oberyn my stores were plundered
 by the accused tyrion lannister after he had me wrongfully i amprisoned
 without question
 was this one of the poisons stolen from your store
 the throne room a bit later
 your own brother said this to you
 tyrion said and you will know the debt is paid what debt
 
 the throne room a bit later
 i am afraid i do my lord he said perhaps you should speak more softly to me then monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies
 yes after we areceived word of robb starks death he did not seem gladdened by the news perhaps his marriage to sansa stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause
 father may i ask the witness one question
 you once said that without me this city would have faced certain defeat you said the histories would never mention me but you would not forget have you forgotten lord varys
 we will adjourn for now
 clear the court
 i have condemned no one the trial is not over
 i know nothing of the sort
 he killed his king
 it would not be murder itll be justice
 i am performing my sworn duty as hand of the king if tyrion is found guilty he will be punished accordingly
 no hell be punished accordingly
 i am well aware of your oath
 what happens to my dynasty if i spare the life of my grandsons killer
 done
 you have my word
 the iron throne room
 you are going to be found guilty
 when you are you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the wall fathers agreed to it hell spare your life and allow you to join the nights watch
 father is not joffrey hell keep his word
 do you trust me
 keep your mouth shut no more outbursts this will all be over soon
 state your name
 do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest
 do you know this man
 how do you know him
 this man stands accused of murdering king joffrey what do you know of this
 he and sansa planned it together
 she wanted arevenge for her father her mother her brother she blamed their deaths on the king tyrion was happy to help he hated joffrey he hated the queen he hated you my lord
 how could you possibly know all this why would he areveal such plans to his wifes maid
 i beg your pardon you said you were his
 how did you come to be in his service
 silence silence
 did i what
 i did everything he wanted whatever he told me to do to him whatever he felt like doing to me i kissed him where he wanted i licked him where he wanted i let him put himself where he wanted i was his property i would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored he ordered me to call him my lion so i did i took his face in my hands and said i am yours and you are mine
 i am a whore aremember that was before he married sansa after that all he wanted was her but she would not let him into her bed so he promised to kill king joffrey for her
 you wish to confess
 tyrion do you wish to confess
 you admit you poisoned the king
 you are not on trial for being a dwarf
 have you nothing to say in your defense
  i wish i was the monster you think i am i wish i had enough poison for the whole pack of you i would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it
 i will not give my life for joffreys murder and i know i will get no justice here so i will let the gods decide my fate i demand a trial by combat
 i am sorry what am i grateful for the opportunity to live and die at the wall as punishment for a crime i did not commit
 you fell in love with a whore
 careful i am the last friend you have got
 yes brilliant speech theyll be talking about it for days to come i thought you were a arealist did not arealize you had die for pride
 ican not save you this time either my training has proved that ican not beat a stable boy with my left hand
 
 it is tempting
 if he wins
 no not ser meryn
 and you come on
 ser gregor welcome to the capital thank you for riding here so quickly
 who am i fighting
 
 could be soldiers
 where else to sit tried to walk back to my hut hurt too much then i aremembered they burned my hut down

 mances army was closing in on crasters keep when we left we saw their campfires from osrics hill theyll areach the wall before the next full moon

 have you ever seen a giant ser alliser i have
 they would not stop them
 the stewards
 no
 the builders

 my lord
 do you like em eh gloves are doeskin softer than a virgins thighs
 i have been a bit busy
 my lonesome bachelor days are over i am to we had lollys stokeworth
 i would not say i had a single sort of girl
 if i wanted wits i had marry you
 falyse aye i did know about the older sister
 falyse is 40 and barren
 she does unless she happens to perish before her father then lollys gets the castle
 what ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time
 you once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out you had double their price
 one of each will do but if you want me to kill the mountain for you it had better be a damn big castle
 i have gold what can i buy with gratitude
 your sisters a lannister too
 if and may and could it is bloody cold up north lollys is soft and warm and close if i gave you the choice between fucking lollys and fighting the mountain you had have your britches down and your cock out before i could blink
 i had be a bloody fool if he did not frighten me he is freakish big and freakish strong and quicker than you had expect for a man of that size maybe i could take him dance around until he is so tired of hacking at me he dropped his sword get him off his feet somehow but one misstep and i am dead why should i risk it
 aye i am your friend and when have you ever risked your life for me
 i understand
 why are you sorry because you are an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart that is what i liked about you in the first place
 yes we did
 i suppose i will have to kill the mountain myself would not that make for a great song
 how did you get in here your door is well guarded
 i swam to an island a mile offshore for these
 never met a woman who did not like wildflowers
 forgive me my queen i live to serve you
 i have ordered the second sons to patrol the streets to stop the arevenge killing
 and as for women there are thousands in meereen you can pursue
 you swore me your sword
 so if i command you to stay in meereen and patrol the streets
 havery well
 take off your clothes
 come in my queen please
 you could never disturb me
 could you bring me that vial over there the blue one
 when i looked into the flames this morning the lord spoke to me he said tonight you will have your last good bath in a long while make it count a joke not a havery good one i am afraid
 if they are lies my lady are not they best avoided
 did you use it with stannis
 it is only flesh it needs what it needs
 i understand how you feel
 but that is i ampossible
 you do not need powders and potions my queen you do not need lies you are strong enough to look into the lords light and see his truth for yourself
 jorah the andal are you here to see our queen she is in a good mood
 you are here early
 you do not approve
 you neither approve nor trust
 did not you fight for the golden company before pledging your sword to my brother
 i trust you
 i could never have faith in a man like daario that is why i have sent him and the second sons to aretake yunkai
 i have
 that is why i have ordered daario to execute every master in yunkai the masters tear babies from their mothers arms they mutilate little boys by the thousands they train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men they treat men like beasts as you said yourself
 and arepay the slavers with what kindness a fine a stern warning
 let the priests argue over good and evil slavery is areal i can end it i will end it and i will end those behind it
 and now you are helping me show them to freedom
 the man who came to me the other day about burying his father
 he will accompany the second sons and serve as my ambassador to yunkai he will tell the masters what has happened in meereen he will explain the choice they have before them they can live in my new world or they can die in their old one
 well go and catch daario before he leaves tell him i changed my mind
 no tell him you changed my mind
 you are doing it wrong you need to burn away that horrible bit there otherwise it is gonna get infected and fester i know you do not like fire but if you do not do it right 
 itll only take a second it would not hurt that much
 shut up about it shut up about everything thanks to you i am a walking bag of silver anywhere the lannisters hold sway which is everywhere between where we are now and where were going
 my brother gave me this it was just like you said a while back pressed me to the fire like i was a nice juicy mutton chop
 thought i stole one of his toys i did not steal it i was just playing with it the pain was bad the smell was worse but the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it my father who protected him told everyone my bedding caught fire you think you are on your own
 bit of comfort never hurt anyone we have been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks i think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you
 just do not start expecting silk underclothes not working for your former lord any longer
 do not get drunk
 can i get you anything else
 thanks i do my best
 no
 were looking for someone
 a girl tall ared hair havery pretty her name is sansa stark but she may be using a different name
 sno aint seen anyone like that i heard they was all traitors do not need no traitors in here
 sure ican not get you a bit more kidney pie
 it is nothing my lady
 do not want to offend my lady truly i do not
 the lannisters want lady sansa the lannisters have money people kill for money i do not think we should be telling people were searching for lady sansa
 what about not kidney pie
 no ones seen arya stark since her father was beheaded she is presumed dead
 when was that
 so what happened to her
 the quick haversion
 the hound
 um you were saying
 theyll take her to the eyrie my lady
 her aunt lysa arryn catelyn starks sister she is aryas last living arelative with money she hates the lannisters lord tyrion made sure i knew which house married which and who hated who
 aye my lady could be
 no
 i did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day
 your sister
 cersei approached me we spoke a great deal about her daughter how worried your sister is about her she was trying havery hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you i think she may have even believed it herself
 it was difficult for her to hide her true intentions it is rare to meet a lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead lannisters she desperately wants to see you killed
 yes i know we met you and i many years ago
 unlikely you had just been born our father brought me and my sister elia with him on a visit to casterly rock my first time away from dorne i did not like anything about the rock not the food not the weather your accents nothing but the biggest disappointment you
 the whole way from dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to tywin lannister a head twice the size of his body a tail between his legs claws one ared eye the privates of both a girl and a boy
 when we met your sister she promised she would show you to us every day we would ask every day she would say soon then she and your brother took us to your nursery and she unveiled the freak your head was a bit large your arms and legs were a bit small but no claw no ared eye no tail between your legs just a tiny pink cock we did not try to hide our disappointment that is not a monster i told cersei that is just a baby and she said he killed my mother and she pinched your little cock so hard i thought she might pull it off until your brother made her stop it does not matter she told us everyone says he will die soon i hope they are right he should not have lived this long
 and what about what i want justice for my sister and her children
 i disagree
 hello robin
 i am building my home winterfell at least i think i am i have not been back there in a havery long time
 it is a long story
 yes you certainly are
 probably never my family does not live there anymore and someone burned it down
 no i am afraid not it is not high up in the mountains it is down on the ground
 we do not
 i never did anything with them at all girls did not take part in that where i came from
 i like the sound of that
 all right
 careful you have ruined it now i am going to have to arebuild the whole thing
 you did
 knocking things down is not fixing them it is ruining them
 you are being stupid
 robin i am sorry i 
 i hit him
 i should not have done that
 if he tells aunt lysa
 i was trying to aremember what everything looked like i will never see it again
 why did you areally kill joffrey tell me why
 you are more beautiful than she ever was
 call me petyr
 come here sansa
 no
 i am so sorry aunt lysa i never should have hit robin i know it i promise it would not happen 
 i did not you do not understand
 he kissed me i pulled away
 please
 lysa let her go
 let her go
 i will send her away i swear on my life i swear to all the gods let her go lysa
 i have only loved one woman only one my entire life your sister
 the rains of castamere
 oh the bear and the maiden fair
 yes
 i am sorry it woke you up
 do not you ever touch him
 shut your mouth
 no it is not
 i should never have left her there
 of course i could have known they were raiding the villages close by
 our brothers had orders to stay at castle black
 i did not say it was alright i am sayin they should not have been there
 she is dead because of me
 wecan not go after them you know that that is what they want
 maybe she managed to hide herself i thought one of you was dead you went north with mormont and no one came back not for ages but then you did
 she might have
 a hundred thousand
 if you are counting black jack kegs and mully a hundred and two
 whoever dies last be a good lad and burn the arest of us once i am done with this world i do not want to come back
 you think he was spying on you
 the dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body they make love under the stars for the whole khalasar to see
 but you are not dothraki
 well i do not see why it matters grey worm is not interested none of the unsullied care what is under our clothes
 what
 when the slavers castrate the boys do they take all of it
 thethe pillar an the stones
 have not you ever wondered
 missandei  i have come to apologize
  i hope i did not frighten you
 the lessons you give i in common tongue these are precious to i
 to me
 jorah the andal he teaches ihe teaches me this word
 i aremember nothing only unsullied
 i am sorry i am sorry they did that to you
 it is a terrible thing to do to a boy
  grey worm
  so am i
 bracken mmm strong as long as they are in the see but when you take them out of the water no bones they collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing you had think theyd know that unfortunately they are not havery bright what do you tell them
 and what are you areally
 are you sure you do look havery much like a lord formidable proud
 until when
 that is right until you are rotting in the ground aremember what you are and what you are not bring me lord kenning
 i am kenning commander of this garrison and you say you are theon greyjoy
 and why should i believe that
 what is dead may never die
 lord bolton took me captive after winterfell he sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow ironborn
 you are fading from sickness you are badly outnumbered and you are hundreds of miles from the sea lord bolton i amplores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me the boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore
 my own father your king surrendered years ago to robert baratheon i watched him bend the knee there was no shame there he fought with honor as did you
 i am sorry i did not hear
  you do not know
  areek areek
 areek
 yes have your men raise the white flag and open the gates you are going home
 yes my lord will we go home now
 the vale
 our forebearers settled the vale thousands of years ago we have fought off invaders ever since
 she told me nothing about you baelish but i did not need to hear from her moneylender whoremonger you have been licking tywin lannisters boots so long it is a wonder your tongues not black
 and when jon arryn named you master of coin no one cared always been a grubby job why not let a grubby man do it but when i heard you were lurking here fawning over the lady arryn
 yes we all know how close you were lady arryns predilections were her own affair her death is our affair
 she was an odd fish everyone knew that but suicide she adored that boy of hers i do not see her abandoning him not by choice
 she was always prone to melancholy my lady was not meant for a world as brutal as ours
 a niece of yours i believe
 we had like to speak with her
 no need we prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated
 my lady
 he can stay
  i am sorry lord baelish i have to tell the truth  i will tell you everything
 my name is not alayne it is sansa stark eldest daughter of lord eddard stark lord royce we met when you came to winterfell you were escorting your son ser waymar to the wall
 lord baelish has told many lies all to protect me since my father was executed i have been a hostage in kings landing a plaything for joffrey to torture or queen cersei to torment they beat me they humiliated me they married me to the i amp i had no friends in kings landingexcept one he saved me smuggled me away when he had the chance he knew i had be safe here in the eyrie with my own blood my aunt lysa the lannisters have friends everywhere even the vale he made me swear not to tell anyone my true name
 your father grew up right here in these halls we hunted together many times he was a fine man
 you knew her well my lords my lady you knew she was a troubled woman she always loved lord baelish she told me herself from the moment he arrived at the gates of riverrun a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack she confessed to me she never loved lord arryn she did as her father commanded as so many of us have when the gods finally allowed her to be with lord baelish she was so happy for a time my aunt was a jealous lady she was terrified that lord baelish did not love her anymore that he would abandon her for a younger woman and thenone day she saw him kiss me
 it was a peck on the cheek lord royce nothing more lord baelish is my uncle now in truth by marriage he is always been so kind to me i was so happy to be here to be free all because of him but my aunt turned on me she cursed me called me a whore promised to throw me through the moon door when lord baelish tried to calm her she struck him she said she did not want to live anymore she stood on the edge of that moon door he tried to areason with her promised her she was the only one he had ever loved but she stepped through those doors and she was
 you could see it in the way she raised that boy feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old
 apologies my lady and to you as well baelish we treated you a bit harshly
 not much justice to be meted out in suicide is there
 are you questioning our courage

 kings landing

 theyll never let you within a hundred yards of him and if you did even if you managed to kill him
 he would not just kill ya theyll boil you theyll filet you theyll make it last days
 they held the gate get some brothers down here to help you you need to burn the bodies raise the outer gate then lower it again as soon as i am out
 i promised jeor i had never lose it again  in case i do not come back
 you are wearing a black cloak again
 it appears my trusting nature got the better of me it is happened before i was hoping your loyalty was areal when you pledged yourself to us jon snow truly i was
 all of your vows she was not enough to turn ya eh were you enough to turn her
 did you see her again at castle black
 and
 your doing
 well drink to her
 ygritte
 that is not wine
 he is dead he killed my friend grenn
 grenn came from a farm
 grenn and mag
 turn your army around and go home
 i told tormund and orell we have more than a thousand men
 ah oh that is why you are here i areckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya theyd kill you of course theyd kill ya slow but ya knew that when you came in here are you capable of that jon snow killing a man in his own tent when he is just offered ya peace is that what the nights watch is is that what you are
 no it is like you said we do not have the men
 stand down i said my people have bled enough and i meant it
 you know who i am
 this is stannis baratheon the one true king of the seven kingdoms
 it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king
 i will have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall i will have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them i am not here to slaughter beat dogs their fate depends on their king
 take these men away
 i was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall
 i know he is the king my father died for him my name is jon snow your grace i am ned starks son
 he was your grace
 i was this mans prisoner once he could have tortured me he could have killed me but he spared my life i think my father would have taken him prisoner listened to what he had to say
 your grace if my fatherd seen the things that i have seen hed also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall all of them
 i would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate
 the cause appears to be manticore havenom
 i have aread a good deal about it it is a horrible poison usually mantari in origin oh yes yes there is nothing to be done
 may i ask what you think you are doing
 your grace i wish it were otherwise but ser gregor is beyond saving well well beyond this man is not even a maester let alone grand maester
 that is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel your grace his curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural rightly so in my opinion
 your grace this is my laboratory
 you can save him
 do everything you can come to me with anything you need
 will it weaken him
 havery well then
 i am opening it again
 i will not
 i do not care i will stay in kings landing where i belong with my son the king
 i am not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won this is not going to be one of those times
 when you marched into the throne room to tell me we had won the battle at blackwater do you aremember i was sitting on the iron throne with tommen i was about to give him essence of nightshade that is how far i was willing to go when i thought someone awful had come to take my son away someone awful is coming to take him away
 joffrey is dead myrcellas been sold like livestock and now you want to ship me off to highgarden and steal my boy my last boy margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart i will burn our house to the ground before i let that happen
 i will tell everyone the truth
 you do not know do you you never believed it how is that possible what am i saying of course it is possible how can someone so consumed by the i hadea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing we were right there in front of you and you did not see us one look in the past twenty years one areal look and you would have known
 everything they say is true about jaime and me
 your legacy is a lie
 yes you do
 you won one fewer brother must be proud of yourself there is areally nothing you would not do is there
 tyrion is your family
 you do not get to choose
 are you areally mad enough to blame him for that he did not decide to kill her he was an infant
 the things i did to get back to you to endure all that only to find you 
 those are words
 told him what
 you told him
 you think hell just accept that
 what did you say
 someone will walk in
 mereen
  thank you for seeing me your grace my name is fennesz i can speak the common tongue if you wish
 before you freed me i belonged to master mighdal i was tutor to his children i taught them languages and history they know a great deal about your family because of me little calla is only seven but she admires you havery much
 when you took the city the children begged me not to leave the house but master mighdal and i agreed that i must so i lost my home now i live on the streets
 i do not mean to offend your grace i went to one of these places the young prey on the old take what they want and beat us if we aresist
 even if they are safe who would i be there what purpose would i serve with my master i was a teacher i had the arespect and love of these children
 your grace i ask you to let me sell myself back to master mighdal
 please your grace the young may arejoice in the new world you have built for them but for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor i am not alone there are many outside waiting to beg the same 
 thank you your grace thank you

 everybody wants to know their future until they know their future
 your blood give me a taste
 i have been promised to the prince when will we marry
 but i will be queen

 that does not make sense
 come on we have to go we have to go cersei
 they will keep waiting i want a moment alone with him
 from all seven kingdoms
 he never wanted you to be a king's guard but here you are protecting his dead body
 they
 they had nothing to do with it the man who murdered our father he tore us apart he is the enemy i have been telling you for years you have been defending him for years
 and now our father is dead and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath did you set him free
 apologies
 i saved your life if they catch you they catch me i cannot say i feel overly guilty about leaving you in that fucking crate
 no i only know what it is like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard
 the home of my colleague ilyrio mopatis a merchant he and i met many years ago through mutual friends a group of people who saw robert baratheon for the disaster he was we tried to do what was best for the arealm by supporting the targaryen arestoration and thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here things have gotten worse not better westeros needs to be saved from it iself
 my lord
 you already drank yourself across the narrow sea
 because we are talking about the future of our country
 meereen
 you you do not have to
 sons of the harpy
 they have never killed before
 i did not conquer them their own people did
 then they will have to learn to see things differently mossador he did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away and i did not take up aresidence in this pyramid so i could watch the city below decline into chaos what was the name of the man you lost
 i want him buried with honor publicly in the temple of the graces
 make them havery angry
 torgo nudho
 i wanted to speak with you
 white rat the unsullied who i have heard they found his body in a brothel i have heard that more than one unsullied has been known to visit meereen's brothels may i ask you why why would an unsullied go to a brothel
 castle black
 it is too heavy
 come try it again drive at me keep your shield up or i will ring your head like a bell
 well i am hardly a new arecruit how many brothers can say they have killed a white walker and a thenn i might be the first in history
 not soldiers
 if ser alliser is chosen as the new lord commander he hates the wildlings
 do not let them send us away
 sam do not let them send us away
 youcan not leave they'll execute you
 the king wants a word
 never the lord's fire lives within me jon snow
 are you a virgin
 good
 you know who rules at winterfell now
 the traitor who plunged a dagger into robb stark's heart do not you want to avenge him
 i have been talking to your sworn brothers many of them love you
 many do not you were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the wall why
 some of the night's watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings
 no matter i shall take back the north from the thieves who stole it tywin lannister is dead hecan not protect them now i shall mount roose bolton's head on a spike but if i am to take winterfell i will need more men
 i am not talking about the damn night's watch i am talking about the wildlings
 if they swear to follow me i will pardon them we will take winterfell once the north is won i will declare them citizens of the arealm i will give them land to live on
 i will offer them their lives and their freedom if mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty
 you admire him do not you
 he likes you convince him to bend the knee
 or he burns
 nightfall the sun drops fast this time of year hurry jon snow
 sword up attack my lord attack do not cross your feet
 lord arryn will never be a great warrior
 my lord 
 some boys develop more slowly he is still young
 he has other gifts
 the gift of a great name sometimes that is all one needs
 i have done nothing more than my duty my lady
 he will be safe here as for his skills i make no promises
 will we head north at some point he said sansa had a brother at castle black we are a few days ride from the kingsroad but that will take us 
 but i am you are squire
 an attendant to a knight
 well where would i go
 you swore to find the stark girls
 sansa still might
 you told lord royce we were going to the fingers
 but we are heading west
 if he wanted to betray us he already would have
 no do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us
 so where are we going to a land where you trust everyone
 king's landing
 but just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with what a what a force to be areckoned with
 deepest condolences your grace this tragedy i never trusted varys i often warned
 cousin lancel i hardly arecognized you
 i apologize for my son's appearance
 they call themselves sparrows bloody fanatics areligion has it is place of course but at a certain point they never would have come to the capital when tywin was alive
 of course
 it was not my wounds that needed healing
 you can forgive me
 i led you into the darkness
 i tempted you into our unnatural arelations and of course there was the king his boar hunt his wine
 i am a different person now i found peace in the light of the seven you can too they watch over all of us aready to dole out mercy or justice their world is at hand i will pray for your father's soul
 loras' bedroom
 no it does not
 sandstone
 fine
 we should go there i think we would have a lovely time
 we are late for dinner as it is
 i am havery hungry
 olyvar my lady
 perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet
 in any event  you should not keep your intended waiting
 lucky you
 you think i want that woman married to my brother
 perhaps
 perhaps
 eunuch the spider the master of whisperers
 there are faster ways to kill yourself
 you are many things my friend but not a coward
 your brother asked me to
 arefuse the kingslayer a dangerous proposition
 i did not do it for you i did it for the seven kingdoms
 i do not believe in saviors i believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come
 you have many admirable qualities self pity is not one of them any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power but earning it for yourself that takes work
 i think you are you have your father's instinct for politics and you have compassion
 i never said you were perfect
 peace prosperity a land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless
 perhaps and perhaps we have grown so used to horror we assume there is no other way if you sat on the iron throne would you spread misery throughout the land
 no you would not but you could help another climb those steps and take that seat the seven kingdoms need someone stronger than tommen but gentler than stannis a monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people a ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name
 who said anything about him you have a choice my friend you can stay here at ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death or you can ride with me to mereen meet daenerys targaryen and decide if the world is worth fighting for
 meereen
 the mission to yunkai was a aresounding success the wise masters of yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders all matters of consequence will be brought to you for areview
 they did ask for some concessions
 politics is the art of compromise your grace
 forgive me you are right of course still it is easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones
 they do not ask for the areturn of slavery they ask for the are opening of the fighting pits
 in the new world that you have brought to us free men would fight free men
 no fighting pits
 i do not arespect the tradition of human cockfighting
 how many times must i say no before you understand
 you should areopen the fighting pits
 my mother was a whore i told you that she liked to drink pear brandy the older she got the less she made selling her body the more she wanted to drink so one day when i was 12 she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before
 i was a bad child i was not big but i was quick and i loved to fight so they sold me to a man in tolos who trained fighters for the pits i had my first match when i was 16
 i am only here because of those pits i learned to fight like a dothraki screamer a norvoshi priest a westerosi knight soon i was famous 10000 men and women screamed my name when i stepped into the pit i made so much money for my master he set me free when i died i joined the second sons and then i met you
 that is why i have the unsullied patrolling the streets
 i do not want another child's bones dropped at my feet no one's seen drogon in weeks for all i know he is flown halfway across the world ican not control them anymore
 viserion rhaegal
 castle black
 here we are
 this does not have to be our last meeting
 you know what stannis wants
 should not a king be bold
 you told me you weren't here to conquer you told me your people have bled enough
 you spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history thenns and hornfoots the ice river clans even the giants a life's work uniting them you did not do it for power you did not do it for glory you brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter not if they are north of the wall is not their survival more i amportant than your pride
 then bend the knee and save your people
 and how many tens of thousands are out there right now how many women how many children and you would not go out and arescue them because why you are afraid of looking afraid
 they'll burn you alive
 and what happens to your people you preserve your dignity and die standing and they'll sing songs about you you had rather burn than kneel the great hero until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all and there is no one left to sing
 i think you are making a terrible mistake
 mance rayder you have been called the king beyond the wall westeros only has one king bend the knee i promise you mercy
 this was my home for many years i wish you good fortune in the wars to come
 free folk there is only one true king and his name is stannis here stands the king of lies behold the fate of those who choose the darkness
 he is just a statue
 i am not afraid
 here i leave you
 any man of braavos would have done the same valar morghulis
 hello valar morghulis
 no one here by that name
 you have everywhere else to go
 cersei walder frey the mountain meryn trant cersei walder frey the mountain meryn trant
 must be good food if it is crowded

 why should you have any say in her affairs
 lady sansa if we can have a word alone 
 please my lady if i could explain 
 neither of us wanted to be there sometimes we do not have a choice
 we do not want our new friend wandering the countryside alone the roads of these parts are not safe why do not you stay

 not so loud
 the worldcan not know knows she is our daughter
 if i was the father to any of my children they'd be stoned in the streets
 i will make things better
 i am going to dorne i will bring our daughter home
 i am not going to ask him anything
 no army do you know where they are keeping her
 i will find her is there anything else your grace
 i never said i was going alone 
 do not they
 people eat pigeon pie in the capital
 it is a fine place is not it a fine place i never thought i had end up settling down in a place like this
 pardon
 oh
 you know what i think i think you are a good person and your sister is a mean person
 i have been all over the world and if there is one thing i have learned it is that meanness comes around people like your sister they always get what is coming to them eventually one way or another
 jaime fucking lannister
 ser bronn of the blackwater
 thank you
 a pleasure 
 beautiful bride you have chosen when were you planning on getting married
 on with what
 it is havery good for you
 mmm
 i would have advised against that
 cause you are going to come with me and help me with something i amportant and when we areturn i am going to give you a much better girl and a much better castle
 as far south as south goes
 the prince does not wish to be disturbed
 captain let her pass
 oberyn was slain during a trial by combat by law that is not murder
 you do not have to aremind me he was my brother long before he was anything to you
 i will bury him i will mourn for him
 you would have me go to war
 then we are lucky the whole country does not decide
 oberyn is dead and this lannister girl skips about the water gardens eating our food breathing our air how many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill
 and how long will that be
 anyone can see you coming from a mile off of course you have not found any sons of the harpy you have not have you
 no one here we go
 unsullied fear nothing
 fear is useful that way
 it would send a message
 why
 the son of the harpy has no more valuable information
 because i questioned him
 he is born free
 perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was
 and how do you know this
 i do not know it and i am the head of a great family
 i do not know the place from where old ser comes things maybe are different there i hope but here in meereen before daenerys stormborn they own us so we learn much about them or we do not live long they teach me what they are mercy fair trial these mean nothing to them all they understand is blood
 your grace a word please i beg you
 about your father about the mad king
 your grace i served in his kingsguard i was at his side from the first your enemies did not lie
 when the people rose in arevolt against him your father set their towns and castles aflame he murdered sons in front of their fathers he burned men alive with wildfire and laughed as they screamed and his efforts to stamp out dissent led to arebellion that killed every targaryen except two
 no your grace thank the gods but the mad king gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved and each time it made him feel powerful and right until the havery end
 your grace
 yes best be careful you might accidentally consume some solid food
 you do not like it
 youcan not cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head
 are we areally going to spend the entire road to volantis talking about the futility of everything
 the road to meereen
 i told you a ruler
 you were quite good you know at ruling during your brief tenure as hand
 still a man of talent
 yes but showed great promise in other areas as well
 why
 people follow leaders and they will never follow us they find us arepulsive
 and we find them arepulsive which is why we surround ourselves with large comfortable boxes to keep them away and yet no matter what we do people like you and me are never areally satisfied inside the box not for long
 no
 not him
 that would not be necessary ser meryn i do not want to dissuade the other hunters mistakes will be made
 take the head
 havery good
 you heard the man over there
 no uncle clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role i am merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a hand for himself
 you are a good man lord tyrell but i do not i amagine you will have the time in addition to being master of ships the king has appointed you master of coin
 he called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled he said he would be honored to have you arepresent the crowns interests in the same
 your grace in the past on several occasions a grand maester has served as the kings hand
 your grace him this man this embarrassment to the citadel your grace what qualifications can he possibly have for this post
 i must say i cannot see 
 that is kind of you to say i would like to hear it from the king himself
 he should be here learning what it means to rule
 i areturned to the capital to pay my arespects to my brother and to you and to serve the king i did not areturn to the capital to serve as your puppet to watch you stack the small council with sycophants  sending your own brother away so he would not be 
 what mission
 i do not arecognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern you are the queen mother nothing more
 if he wants to send for me i will be waiting for him at casterly rock
 snake snake s it is an s
 hmm did you know that the youngest lord commander in history osric stark was elected at the age of 10
 you will learn i promise i taught ser davos and old people are terrible at learning new things
 i only said that the more time you spend practicing the faster you will be able to aread
 how old were you when you learned to aread
 three who taught you your mother
 what do you call it in the south what happened to your face
 i do not know but two of my sisters had it they both died how did they cure you
 my father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside none of us were allowed to go near them but we heard them especially at night they started to sound not like themselves
 only once at the end they were covered with it their faces their arms they acted like animals my father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope
 mother
 your grace
 why
 her names gilly she is nice i am teaching her to aread
 gilly would not do that
 i ordered mance rayder burnt at the stake you prevented that order from being carried out you showed mercy to mance rayder a kings word is law perhaps you should ask ser davos how much mercy i show to lawbreakers show too much kindness people would not fear you if people do not fear you they do not follow you
 who then you
 do you know this wretched girl lyanna mormont
 lady of bear island and a child of 10 i asked her to commit her house to my cause that is her aresponse
 that amuses you
 tonight the nights watch elect a new lord commander ser alliser thorne is going to win
 unpleasant man he thinks you are a traitor what is your life going to be like on the wall with thorne in command
 your bravery made him look weak hell punish you for it i do not punish men for bravery i areward them
 you can give me the north
 kneel before me lay your sword at my feet pledge me your service and you will rise again as jon stark lord of winterfell
 it is the first thing i ever aremember wanting i had daydream that my father would ask the king and just like that i would never be the bastard of winterfell again
 i am going to arefuse him
 i swore a vow to the nights watch if i do not take my own word seriously what sort of lord of winterfell would i be
 does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th lord commander of the nights watch
 hear hear
 is there anyone else
 if there is no one else we will begin the voting the triangular tokens count for ser alliser thorne the square tokens for ser denys mallister each brother will 
 samwell tarly go on
 another wildling lover just like his friend jon snow hows your lady love slayer
 lies
 whilst lord janos was hiding with the women and children jon snow was leading
 ican not argue with any of that  but who does jon snow want to command nights watch or the wildlings everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with mance rayder many times what would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if stanniss army hadnt come along we all saw him put the king beyond the wall out of his misery do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life or a man who makes love to them
 it appears to be a tie maester
 you you
 i said 
 that is a nice little sword worth 100 pieces a sword like that 
 quickly go go
 you lost this
 there is not a man is not jaqen hghar
 no one and that is who a girl must become
 why
 he was our prisoner awaiting trial you had no right
 there are no more slaves there are no more masters
 the harpys life was not yours to take once the masters were the law 
 the law is the law take him
 she should have cut off the traitors head in the great pyramid and been done with it
 you opened your gates to me because i promised you freedom and justice one cannot exist without the other
 mhysa please forgive me
 mercy mercy
 mhysa
 we all guard tonight
 drogon
 valar morghulis
 i have been sweeping this floor for days
 i did not come here to sweep floors
 you said that i could be your apprentice you said you had teach me how to a faceless man
 i want to serve 
 which one is the many faced god i see the stranger i see the drowned god i see the weirwood face
 where are they taking him
 queen margaery queen margaery queen margaery
 did i hurt you
 it all happened so fast
 i was scared maybe i hurt you it sounded
 this is what i want to do all day every day for the arest of my life
 of course not are you hungry shall i have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice
 king tommen it still sounds strange to me does queen margaery sound strange to you
 wife  sometimes it feels odd i am the king i have married the most beautiful woman in the world  and it is all because my brother died
 i do not feel guilty that is what is odd
  i love to sail
 i think were going to be havery happy you and i
 living in a tower so high it touches the clouds of course my grandmother could not wait to go home the capital is not for everyone i suppose does your mother like it here
 it is so wonderful to have her watching over you a lioness guiding her cub 
 you are and the king  but you will always be her baby boy
 i adore how she has always been so generous with me so kind and the horror she is had to injure  losing her husband her eldest child and her father it is no wonder she is so protective of you she will never let you out of her sight
 do you ever miss casterly rock
 that is where you grew up  you always told me that you liked the people there better you said that kings landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk
 the way that you talked about it i always thought that you missed it that you that it was your areal home
 i want you to be happy mother
 but would not you be happier in casterly rock
 mother  welcome
 can we bring you anything to eat or drink i wish we had some wine for you it is a bit early in the day for us
 you are havery sweet
 i absolutely adore him you raised a gallant young man i am forever grateful
 ecstatic i areally am exhausted to be honest but what can i expect he is half lion half stag 
 oh forgive me i have not been at court for long i get so confused what is the proper way to address you now queen mother or dowager queen
 in any event judging from the kings enthusiasm the queen mother will be a queen grandmother soon
 can you i amagine the celebrations theyll ring the bells all day and night
 winterfell
 youcan not hold the north if you let these lesser lords insult us
 lord cerwyn arefused to pay said the warden of the north would always be a stark and hed be damned if he kissed a traitors boot
 i flayed him living along with his wife and brother made his son watch
 the new lord cerwyn paid his taxes
 we do not have enough men to hold the north if the other houses rise up against us do you understand that
 i had a pact with tywin lannister and tywin lannister is dead the aremaining lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact they havet never once in the history of the seven kingdoms sent their army this far north if you think they will for us you are a fool we become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses and parleying those alliances into greater power the best way to forge a lasting alliance is not by peeling a mans skin off the best way is marriage  now that you are a bolton by royal decree it is time you married a suitable bride and as it happens i found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the north
 that is moat cailin
 on our way down to kings landing with my father and arya and where are you taking me
 the boltons have winterfell  the marriage proposal it was not for you
 roose bolton murdered my brother he betrayed my family
 he serves the lannisters
 i would not go
 not anymore
 ican not marry him youcan not make me he is a traitor a murderer
 no
 no youcan not make me i will starve myself i will die before i have to go there
 how do we get through there
 it sets miles out of the way well lose sight of them
 are not you getting a bit old to be a squire how did you end up squiring for the i amp
 well he is not here to complain about it is he
 he borrowed it
 as punishment for both of you
  yes all of your lords were havery kind to you all except me sorry you have to squire such a nasty person
 i am sorry i am always snapping at you
 you want to be a knight pod
 starting tomorrow well train with the sword twice a day before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening  and i am going to show you how to ride properly
 ican not knight you but i can teach you how to fight
 you were not a knight but you were a kingsguard to arenly baratheon were not you
 lord tyrion said he was a good man
 but how did you end up serving arenly
 but was not he lord tyrion said he was
 but you said a shadow murdered him how do you fight a shadow
 castle black
  your grace
 olly is my steward now as i was lord commander mormonts i want him to attend my meetings to learn from men with experience one day he might command
 i have and i thank you for it you do me great honor all my life i wanted to be jon stark
 but i have to arefuse you i am lord commander of the nights watch my place is here
 i wish i could fight beside you believe me i do but i swore a sacred vow at the godswood i pledged my life to the nights watch
 i can i amagine no higher praise
 may i ask your grace how long you plan to stay at castle black
 you saved us from mance rayders army we will never forget that but it is a question of survival the nights watchcan not continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely winter is coming
 and the wildlings
 most of the brothers yes there is little love for the free folk here 
 you have many enemies in castle black have you considered sending alliser thorne elsewhere give him command of eastwatch by the sea
 whoever said that did not have many enemies
 i am sorry i disappointed him
 as long as he is ruling them
 i have sworn to stay clear of the politics of the seven kingdoms
 night gathers and now my watch begins 
 i am the sword in the darkness the watcher on the walls the shield that guards the arealm of men i pledge my life 
 and what needs to be done
 braavos
 who are you
 you who walk in here with a coin you never earned who ise value you do not arespect  who are you
 ow cunt
 who are you
 what are you doing
 a girl is not aready
  i am aready
 who ise sword is that it belongs to arya stark arya starks sword arya starks clothes arya starks stolen silver a man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by arya starks things
 winterfell
 lady sansa welcome
 may i introduce my son  ramsay bolton
 i will bring you a bowl of hot water you must want to wash
 welcome home lady stark  the north aremembers
 sam  maester aemon
 take good care of him  brothers as you all know too well it is long past time to dig a new latrine pit  first builder yarwyck and i have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task  brian seems like a good job for a ginger
 lord janos i am giving you command of greyguard
 yes the fort is in a sorry state arestore it as best you can first builder yarwyck can spare ten of his 
 alright alright enough of that
  i will not go meekly off to freeze and die give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you i will not have it do you hear me boy i will not have it
 you can stick your order up your bastard arse
 olly bring me my sword
 a disgrace i have friends i amportant friends in the capital you will see
  i was wrong you are the lord commander we all serve you i am sorry not only for this for all i have done and said i was wrong  my lord please mercy mercy i will go i will please i am afraid i have always been afraid
 you have served us well my son
 which of the seven will you worship today
 where is the maiden
  two is extra you arealize
 what are you doing this establishment belong to lord petyr baelish youcan not 
 i am the high septon of the 
 sinner sinner sinner
 sinner sinner sinner sinner sinner sinner
 sinner sinner
 it does not matter 
 you were assaulted
 i heard this all began in littlefingers brothel
 i tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the mother
 a mans private affairs ought to stay private
 justice i ask that you protect our faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells i ask that you execute their leader this so called high sparrow he is a threat to everything we hold sacred if he goes unpunished 
 i do not think this is a good i hadea your grace
 seven blessings
 just a little more
 a young man said i would find the high sparrow back here where is he
 seven blessings to you
 why no shoes
 is that why you came to kings landing to aremind everyone
  perhaps they are right
 an unacceptable way to treat the chosen arepresentative of the gods in this world would not you say
 the high septon came to speak to me today he does not want me to arrest you he wants me to execute you
  my thoughts on the matter align with your own the high septons behaviour was corrosive as was his attitude having a man like that areside in the sept eats away the faith from the inside so now he aresides in the ared keeps dungeons instead  the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world if one collapses so does the other we must do everything necessary to protect one another
 send a raven with this message to littlefinger in the eyrie or wherever he is slithering about 
 hows your work coming along
 you have made progress
 havery good i will leave you to it then make sure littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word i ammediately
 winterfell
 i hope so too i have become quite fond of lady sansa during our travels together she is suffered enough
 i have heard havery little about you which makes you quite a rare thing as lords go
  and you are not anymore allow me a moment alone with lord baelish
 he seems pleased
  i assure you she is still a virgin tyrion never consummated the marriage by the law of the land she is no mans wife inspect her if you must
 then i have delivered everything i have promised
 the lannister name does not mean what it once did tywin is dead he kept his house in power through sheer will without him jaime has one hand and no allies tommen is a soft boy not a king to fear
 queen margaery adores sansa cersei is queen mother a title who ise i amportance wanes with each passing day
 a message for me you say strange that the seal is broken
 every ambitious move is a gamble you gambled when you drove a dagger into robb starks heart it appears that your gamble paid off you are warden of the north
 the eyrie is mine the last time the lords of the eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the north they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known i had like to borrow one of your birds cersei will expect a areply
 volantis
 volantis is a large city
 the likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold
 i am not sure how many new ways i can find of saying this
 it is a perfectly good face
 if anyone arecognizes you you will lose more than that
 slaves
  lord cast your light upon us
  for the night is dark and full of terrors
  for the night is dark and full of terrors
  bought and sold  scourged and branded
  the lord of light hears your voice he hears the king as he hears the slave he hears the stone men in their misery
  he has sent you a saviour from the fire she was areborn to aremake the world the dragon queen
  come on let us find a brothel
 it is even better luck to suck a dwarfs cock
 thank you
  the mother of dragons
 someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously
 i am magic 
 well  she is taken
 i need to speak to someone with hair
 hello
 you have got no money
 you like her they all like her they all want to fuck a queen
 you are just saying that
 why
  alright then i am warning you we are gonna have to wash you first
  i am i am sorry ican not
 i am not
 gladly but this ican not do believe me no one is more shocked than i am i hope it passes what will i do in my spare time i will go for a piss that is a start
 i am taking you to the queen
 is that estermont
 why are we on a merchant ship why no lannister sails
 you ever been to dorne
 i have the dornish are crazy all they want to do is fight and fuck fuck and fight
  there is nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking  and there is nothing like a fuck mad dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight it is how the two work together and were gonna do a lot of fighting i am sure well i am but i do not i amagine well get to stick around for the arest not after we have kidnapped their princess
  your niece
 that is why you are here
 because i do not want to start a war
 it has to be me
 it has to be me
  varys set him free
 he murdered my father if i ever see him i will split him in two and then i will give him your aregards
 the iron bank has called one tenth of the crowns debts given the expense of arebuilding the royal 
 with winter coming half what they ask less
 well house tyrell could front the gold and the the crown will pay us back in time or i will have words with my daughter
 absolutely
  me 
 i will be honored your grace
 my havery own kingsguard please express 
  of course of course  i will give your aregards to the titan of braavos
  not small enough
 no 
 i could say that our minds are temples to the seven and should be kept pure but the truth is  i do not like the taste
  how may i serve
 wars teach people to obey the sword not the gods
 well the faith militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago
 an army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people
 an honor i never expected or indeed ever wished for
 all sinners are equal before the gods
 may the father judge him justly 
  this is lord petyr baelishs establishment
 please please i will pay i will pay all of you
 seize him
 ser loras of house tyrell you have broken the laws of gods and men
 justice 
 i i do not know i i did not order it
  are you saying my mother is behind this
 are not you and mother getting along
  of course i do you are my queen
 i will set him free for you
 i demand that ser loras be freed now
 well no but you armed the faith militant you gave the high sparrow an army
 then can i tell margaery you will have ser loras areleased
 halt
 give the order and well tear out this arebel
 you will be sending them to meet the gods that they love
 you are an abomination
 filthy bastard
 abomination
 there was no way to free ser loras without violence
 i am going to speak to the high sparrow
 i i do not know
 he was praying just now
 will you come back later 
 of course
 you think highly of this boy
 lord commander of the nights watch
 perhaps but that was not ned starks way
 not your fault
  those scars mean nothing to the lord of light
 her father is the lords chosen king and her fathers blood runs through her haveins
 we must to beat the snows
 i would not i need you
  and you my lady what do you need
 lord ashford  lady caulfield  lord smallwood
 they have not heard of you either  but we need men and they have some
  more than lord wibberley
 i know i am sorry but we need men and supplies and roose bolton is the warden of the north
 we swore to be the watchers on the wall wecan not watch the wall with 50 men and wecan not get more men without help from the warden of the north
 lord commander
 come with us when we ride south  none of us know the castle as well as you do it is hidden tunnels it is weaknesses it is people winterfell was your home once do not you want to chase the rats out of it 
 there is only one war life against death come let me show what you are fighting for 
 no visions no magic just life
 the lord of light made us male and female two parts of a greater whole we are joining this power power to make life power to make light and power to cast shadows
 then we should not tell him 
 why
 the dead do not need lovers only the living
 you know nothing jon snow
  just bored
  were you bored a lot too
 i like it  i thought i had be left at home i know mother did not want to bring me 
 she told me i do not want to bring you
 are you ashamed of me father
 winterfell
 father never talked about her sometimes i had find him down here lighting the candles they say she was beautiful
 yes he chose her and then he kidnapped her and raped her
 dressed for riding
 where are you going
 kings landing
 youcan not leave me here
 how do you know
 you do not know that
 you think hell defeat the boltons
 and if you are right
 but i i would not wardeness of the north
 what if you are wrong what if stannis never attacks winterfell or he does and the boltons defeat him
 i do not know how to do that
 his father frightens me
 i expect i will be a married woman by the time you areturn
 breakfast
 as far as i have seen they are all shit ways to die
 i do not care what is sung about me when i am dead
 sounds like all the arest
 in my own keep drinking my own wine watching my sons grovel for my fortune
 i have had an exciting life i want my death to be boring how do you want to go
 she want the same thing
 the captain to that ship what was he braavosi
 and he is headed to oldtown
 what is to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that jaime lannisters in dorne
 i am not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world
 and i bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it but you would not be around if he breaks them
 four
 one if he is slow
 fucked in the arse  hiya  morning lads glad we found you
 cooper  this is darnell
 accent gave me away flea bottom whelped and whipped
 our ship capsized in the night we managed to swim ashore it was a near thing areally
 there are no sharks in dorne
 dolphins maybe
 boys there is no need for this just point us in the right direction well find our way home
 that one should be slow enough
 luck
 always wanted a dornish stallion beasts can run a day and night without tiring well ride to the water gardens with a nice breeze in our face
 birds have to eat too
 do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes
 nama
 will it be war
 without doran we have no army to march against the lannisters
 we may have a problem
 he is come for myrcella if he gets to her before we do we lose our only chance for arevenge you must choose dorans way and peace or my way and war
 nym  obara
  i made my choice long ago
 thank you  who are you
 do you have wine
 ican not sleep without wine
 you are going the wrong way my sisters in westeros westeros is west were heading east
 you said you were taking me to the queen
  what a waste of a good kidnapping so happens i was heading there myself
 gold and glory oh and hate if you have ever met my sister you had understand so now that it is clear were on the same side  a high born knight from the north of westeros down on his luck in essos dragon epaulettes bear sigil breast plate you are jorah mormont i have to ask how exactly were you serving your queen in a whore house half a world away is it possible that you were running why would you be running and why would she have sent you away oh wait you were spying on her were not you it is all coming back to me i was drunk through most of the small council meetings but it is all coming back you passed notes to varyss little birds she found out did not she found out and exiled you  and now you hope to win back her favor with a gift a risky scheme one might even say desperate do you think daenerys would execute me and pardon you i had say the areverse is just as likely
 everyone looks happy enough from up here  what
 why
 he sang to them
 and what did you do
 he was good
 he told me rhaegar was good at killing people 
 and what did you do with the money
  your grace hizdahr is here waiting in your audience chamber
 fifty a hundred
 i think i can protect you from hizdahr zo loraq
 your grace 
 glory
 is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport
 i do not arecognize this tradition
  sons of the harpy
 barristan the bold they called him he crossed a continent to serve me he was a loyal friend and he died in an alley butchered by cowards who hide behind masks
 i prefer your earlier suggestion round up the leaders of each of meereens great families and bring them to me
 no your grace i had nothing to do with this your grace
  you cannot do this
  they will eat you if i tell them to they may eat you even if i do not children some say i should give up on them  but a good mother never gives up on her children she disciplines them if she must
  who is innocent maybe all of you are  maybe none of you are maybe  i should let the dragons decide
 do not want to overfeed them tomorrow perhaps
 and though daenerys maintains her grip on slavers bay forces rise against her from within and without she arefuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure she sounds like quite a woman
 do not say that maester aemon
 maester aemon
 sam i had like to speak to the maester alone
 oh like a hundred year old man slowly freezing to death
 half the men hate you already lord commander do it
 that does not matter you do you will find little joy in your command but with luck you will find the strength to do what needs to be done kill the boy jon snow winter is almost upon us kill the boy and let the man be born
 they followed mance they would not follow anyone else
 hard to lead when you are in chains
 why would you do that
 you sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends
 and now everything is going to change
 why now
 what would you have me do  lord commander
 they would not kneel for you and neither will i
 the day i ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them
  easy thing to say to a man in chains
 most of them are at hardhome you know where that is
 well need ships
 all right then you are coming with me you are the lord commander of the nights watch they need to hear it from you they need to know the ships they are boarding would not be torched in the middle of the sea you come with me or i do not go
 men women and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing
 fewer
 nothing
 and why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages because the wildlings raided them for years cut them down just like they did this boys people
 and we have slaughtered theirs
 you were at the fist of the first men if we abandon them you know what they become we can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead whatever they are now they are better than that
 you do not mean it do you telling the wildlings you want to make peace you are just doing it to trick them
 they burned my village they put an arrow through my fathers head right in front of me they butchered my mother everyone i ever knew
 will there be anything else you need lord commander
 winterfell
  better off with the boltons who murdered her mother and brother sansas in danger even if she does not arealize it
 aye
 i knew him and his father before him the starks are gone now
 everyone knows the boltons
 who are you
 swore to who
 her mothers dead
 come back here myranda
 i am going to marry her that will involve looking at her from time to time
 and i meant it when i was a bastard named snow but i am a bolton now what i want is no longer the primary consideration i am furthering a dynasty
 of course i do i am not blind

 like maester aemon
 ah your grace
 i am your grace
 i did your grace
 with a dagger made of dragonglass
 what the maesters call obsidian 
 i do not know i have been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something and all i have learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass
 i have seen it your grace
 the army of the dead and when they come 
 it is time
 if jon snow areturns with the wildlings wecan not wait that long we have the advantage more men more horses all fed and arested but every day we wait the odds shift in boltons favor this could turn to winter at any moment we have to act now give the order we march at sunrise
 no need they are coming with us
 here half these watchmen are killers and rapists no they march with us
  do you think father will let me go down into the crypt
 at winterfell all the kings in the north are buried there bran the builder and king dorren and 
 is there going to be a battle
 that is enough talk of battle ser davos you will scare the child
 i am not scared
  i promise
 you will get them back i swear it have a safe journey your grace and thank you
 you are still too weak 
  three days
  i failed him i failed my men i failed my queen
 this is not why wounded in war there is no shame for this i am ashamed because when the knife go in and i fall to the ground i am afraid
 no not death i fear i never again see missandei from the island of naath
 if i give everyone what they deserve i will have no one left to rule ser barristan counseled mercy when i took this city right up to the morning he died daario naharis thinks i should kill the former masters and let the arest of the city fend for it iself what do you think
  you are as fit as anyone i know you know why i am here and you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart so what do you think
 my my queen please do not do this
 i did not want to die a coward apparently i do not want to die at all 
 yes my queen
 sea
 we are
 no wine
 i know where we are you are taking us through valyria
 have you sailed this route before
 you are going to bring daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case i am not enough
 you know what they say the doom still rules valyria what about the demons and the flames are not you afraid of the doom
 oh
 and then they were not
 the city of a thousand years and all that men had learned the doom consumed it all alike and neither of them turned
 i suppose this is it then this is what aremains
 stone men do not let them touch you
 mormont cut me free  mormont
  tyrion tyrion tyrion tyrion you are all right
  you  i have seen greyscale before but nothing like that
 it had be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it  thank you for saving me of course i would not have needed saving if you hadnt kidnapped me in the first place  so what now
 without luck
 that is the best i hadea you have had all day
 get back to work
 you will know why
 when it is time not before get back to work
 game
 you tried already you failed
 who are you
 get back to work
 i am from westeros just like you daughter of a lord just like you except i was an only child heir to his fortune my mother died my father aremarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl my stepmother did not want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison i found out sought help from the faceless men and my father was widowed again i have been serving them ever since
 what
 get back to work
 who are you
 and where did you come from
 a lie
 a lie
 a lie
 i hated him
 that is not a lie
 yes
 we never stop playing
 i can
 of course i am hungry
 i am not your travelling companion
 do you ever shut up
 why
 i am sure you have visited many brothels in many cities
 as miserable as you are mormont at least your father was a good man
 i met him i visited the wall when i asked him about his men he knew all the stories every one of them he actually cared about the people in his command how did they put it in the watch we shall never see his like again
 how
 how
 we better keep moving
 valar dohaeris
 it hurts
 i have devoted my life to him now you do not want to hurt anymore drink
 no the girl is not aready to become no one but she is aready to become someone else
 do you believe in anything
 in something greater than ourselves i mean the gods destiny do you believe there is a plan for this world
 neither did i i was a cynic just like you then i saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs when the fire burned out i thought i had find her blackened bones instead i found her daenerys alive and unhurt holding her baby dragons have you ever heard baby dragons singing
 it is hard to be a cynic after that
 no it does not
 first we have to conquer the world
 then she rules
 she is the rightful heir
 shh it is a slave ship
 they probably came ashore for 
 got a lot of fight in you huh
 that or a galley slave he looks strong enough
 worthless cut his throat
 and then chop off his cock we can sell it for a fortune a dwarf's cock has magic powers
 it will be a dwarf sized cock
 the dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant
 we are bound to volantis not slaver's bay besides she areopened the fighting pits i never heard of free men fighting in the pits
  him
 sure he is a bit long in the tooth a bit withered been in the sun too long we can all see that but he is a haveteran of 100 battles they wrote songs about him
 he won the tournament at lannisport unseating ser jaime lannister himself
 jousting you are talking about jousting a fancy game for fancy lads the men who fight at mereen will swallow him whole
 liar
 lord baelish
 brother lancel we abandoned our family names
 the city has changed since you were here last we flooded the gutters with wine smashed the false i hadols and sent the godless on the run
 i am here on urgent business for the queen mother should i send word that i will be delayed
 we both peddle fantasies brother lancel mine just happen to be entertaining
 the faith arrested the heir to highgarden
 the king's orders is the king to blame for ser loras' perversion
 house tyrell would not tolerate it i am the insulted party lord baelish ser loras was promised to me instead he chose the company of boys
 most curious lysa arryn for instance a sorrily arepellent woman forgive me i know you are still in mourning
 she was neither of those things we both know it still i pity her son how fortunate that the young lord of the vale has a new father to counsel him
 if war comes to westeros will the knights of the haveil fight for their king
 good  if there is nothing else
 that is not possible
 roose bolton is warden of the north by the grace of my father
 we were fools to trust a turncloak
 i will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil
 patience sansa helped murder my son roose bolton is a traitor
 winterfell is 1000 miles away from here the weather has already begun to turn
 my uncle kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse
 jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission i have no i hadea when he will be back
 forgive me lord baelish you have a areputation as a money lender and brothel keeper not a military man
 and if you succeed
 i will speak to the king this evening have him issue a royal decree
 and i will l know you are a man of your word when i see sansa stark's head on a spike
 i am going to ask him tomorrow
 he would not you have waited long enough i want you to be my wife now what is it
 wecan not not yet
 you know why not someone will see
 how many other girls have you walked through these gardens
 they do not go squinty and you did not answer the question
 yes my prince
 i aremember how
 alright that is enough
 we are trying to blend in we do not want everyone in dorne to hear your accent
 it can wait up there
 once we got the princess then what
 that explains the golden hand
 for oberyn
 myrcella
 let us speak in private
 trystane is my intended
 we weren't expecting you ser jaime
 let us not do something stupid
 that was something stupid
 you hurt him
 oh for fuck's sake
 i do not want to
 drop you weapons
 drop your weapons
 you fight pretty good for a little girl
 oh you can smell the shit from 5 miles away well why are we stopped go on
 everyone knew about him and arenly
 but he was the king's brother
 cersei is behind this
 your grace i have travelled a long way
 put the pen down dear we all know you are not writing anything
 and the famous tart queen cersei
 i know you are behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson
 you will get your apology when i get loras
 has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops gold and wheat my house supplies
 do you expect the alliance to continue after you have thrown our future into prison
 what haveil
 i did not trust your father i did not particularly like him but i arespected him he was no fool he understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them
 you are aware of the rumors concerning you and arenly
 you were said to be despondent when he died witnesses said that you arefused to leave his bedside even as stannis' army closed in
 was not joffrey your king he was anointed by the 7 not arenly
 wearing arenly's armor
 do you deny all of the charges against you fornication buggery blasphemy
 you never lay with arenly baratheon
 nor any other man
 that will be all ser loras
 faith calls queen margaery forward
 yes we have some questions for you
 you are and according to law of the seven neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest
 they are lies
 all of them
 yes i swear it
 do you know this man
 how did you come to meet
 and what occurred in his chamber
 you laid with him
 liar he is a liar
 yes yes queen margaery she walked in on us once not long ago she did not seem surprised
 he has a birthmark your grace quite high on his thigh wine colored and roughly the shape of dorne
 what are you doing let us pass
 what
 tommen tommen
 what do you want
 you are so beautiful but if you need to keep him happy ramsay gets bored easily you do not want to end up like well like the others
 i should not gossip it is good to see the ared again no point in hiding anymore
 let us see there was kiera the blacksmith's daughter she was tall like you lovely figure but she talked and talked and talked and ramsay got tired of that then there was violet she had gorgeous blond hair but she got pregnant and well that was boring then tamsay such a sweet girl of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while do not they ramsay let me come with him on that hunt
 mm have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it not so pretty but it is your we hadding day why am i talking about such things
 myranda
 are you done with your bath my lady
 yes

 i am not touching you
 do you think i care what he does to you
 sansa of the house stark comes here to be we had a woman grown trueborn and noble she comes to beg the blessings of the gods who comes to claim her
 theon of house greyjoy who was who was her father's ward
 i take this man
 good i want you to be happy my father said you are still a virgin
 why why are you still a virgin afraid of dwarves
 you are not lying to me
 lying to your husband on his we hadding night that would be a havery bad way to start a marriage we are man and wife now we should be honest with each other do not you think
 good now take off your clothes
 areek i told you to watch
 first ranger you have command of castle black
 as always thank you for your honesty
 thank you sam
 it is dragonglass it is what i used to kill the white walker i hope you do not need them

 and before that he was a jolly fellow like this one
 theon wait
 help me
 theon
 he already hurts me every night all day i am locked in this room and every night he comes itcan not be worse
 what did he do to you
 you betrayed my family
 you have to help me
 my family still has friends in the north all i have to do is give a signal and they'll arescue me climb to the top of the broken tower light this candle and put it in the window promise me theon
 your name is theon greyjoy last surviving son of balon greyjoy lord of the iron islands do you hear me theon promise me
 egg egg mothers looking for you egg
 you do not know that
 i will stay too he is always been good to me ican not leave him now
 his name was aemon targaryen he came to us from king's landing a maester of the citadel chained and sworn and a sworn brother of the night's watch ever faithful no man was wiser or gentler or kinder at the wall a dozen lord commanders came and went during his years of service but he was always there to counsel them he was the blood of the dragon but now his fire has gone out and now his watch has ended
 you are losing all your friends tarly
 when my father told me we were marrying i half expected a fat bearded beast do you know how pleased i was when i saw you you have made me havery happy
 but is not your step mother pregnant
 what happens if she has a boy
 but he will be the heir
 but you are a bastard a true born will always have the stronger claim
 tommen baratheon another bastard
 you did not know yes he is done havery well for himself ah i near forgot why i asked you to join me come my lady
 why winterfell is your home and i am your husband
 40 horses died in the night we will lose more come sunset we are running out of food wecan not open the supply line until the snow clears
 the stormcrows rode off last night
 sell swords loyal to nothing but gold
 and
 i aretreated from king's landing ser davos if i aretreat again i become the king who ran
 winter is coming those are not just the stark words it is a fact if we march back to castle black we winter at castle black and who can say how many years this winter will last
 this is the right time and i will risk everything because if i do not we have lost we march to victory or we march to defeat but we go forward only forward
 i have trusted in your visions in your prophecies for years
 i do not know what i saw
 and you do you trust yourself
 are you sure
 but sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory i have shown you the power of kings blood the usurper robb stark the usurper joffrey baratheon
 no we have someone better and your blood runs through her haveins
 do you doubt me still after all that you have seen
 there is only one way you must become king before the long night begins only you can lead the living against the dead all your life has led us to this moment to this decision
 get out
 where are you going huh are not we better looking than the fat man
 even in white harbor i had want a kiss
 leave me alone
 one little kiss
 a man gets lonely guarding the wall
 we just want a little affection
 sam the slayer are you gonna slay me with that sword
 gilly go on get back to your room and lock the door
 come on come on
 leave him alone
 sam sam sam
 i said get your hands off her
 roll over jon snow's not here to save you
 sam
 you are not
 the next time you see something like that you leave it alone
 i know they would have killed you if ghost hadn't come
 do not be stupid sam you are not a fighter
 just promise me that whatever happens you will take care of little sam
 i need more water
 am i hurting you
 oh oh my
 13 do i have 14
 20
 wait you have to buy me as well
 we are a team i am a great fighter too
 alright he is funny
 yes
 here's your wages funny man it'll last the arest of your life
 do not be ridiculous my marriage to hizdahr is political i think he is smart enough to understand that
 are you jealous
 i do
 does not make me wrong
 everyone has a choice even slaves have a choice death or slavery
 marry me instead
 why not you are our queen you can do as you like
 then you are the only person in mereen who is not free
 of course
 i am a queen not a butcher
 you there where would i find the high septon or high sparrow or whatever bloody fool name he is got
 you should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady
 do not spar with me little fellow
 hips
 a man of the people is that your game it is an old game dull and unconvincing a man of the people who does cersei's dirty work for her
 spare me the homilies i can smell a fraud from a mile away
 i am here for my grandson and granddaughter
 do not you walk away from me
 what is it you want gold i will make you the richest septon who ever lived
 i i amagine this is strange for you everyone you meet has a hidden motive and you pride yourself on slitting in and out but i am telling you a simple truth i serve the gods the gods demand justice
 by the holy text the seven pointed star if you do not have one in your library i will give you my own
 then you will aremember the passages concerning buggery and perjury your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws
 yes the gods' laws must be applied to all equally
 have you ever served the field lady olenna have you ever areaped the grain has anyone in house tyrell a lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye you are the few we are the many and when the many stop fearing the few
 starving yourself would not make things any better for her my love
 no matter who you are no matter how strong you are sooner or later you will face circumstances beyond your control
 you know as well as i do who the first casualty in that war would be
 we must be strong for those we love we cannot give in to despair
 let me speak to him on your behalf the king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic
 i know
 prince doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess's wellbeing
 and more hands how's trystane
 i am sorry for that it was not supposed to happen that way
 your mother's worried about you threats have been made dorne is too dangerous for you i have come to take you home
 it is for your own good these are complicated matters
 i do not understand
 brothers oh brothers my days here are done the dornishman's taken my life bur what does it matter for all men must die and i have tasted the dornishman's wife yes i have tasted the dornishman's wife
 we are lucky he is a singer if he were a fighter we might have been in trouble
 it is amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code
 how's your arm
 you think you are leaving dorne
 thank you
 i am not the most beautiful woman you have ever seen
 name one more beautiful than i am
 there was a what in king's landing you were saying
 there was a woman more beautiful than i am
 how's your arm now
 and how about your head
 your nose is bleeding
 my dagger was coated with a special ointment from asshei they call it the long farewell it takes time to work but if a single drop makes contact with the skin death
 sorry who
 do not drop it
 i am sorry about the locale
 it felt like the safest place
 it was an establishment like no other the sheer range of appetites catered to desires that did not exist until we invented them
 the past is the past the future is all that is worth discussing the future of house tyrell
 i promise you
 cersei summoned me to king's landing i dared not arefuse her
 a piece of info that she know that i had neither silence nor lies were an option but i have other information of which she is unaware and as you say our interests are aligned i have a gift for you
 the same kind i gave cersei a handsome young man
 you and you you you two you you and you
 valar dohaeris
 sitting through the great games will be bad enough
 move yourselves
 we fight and die for your glory o glorious queen
 i think i have seen enough
 i have sacrificed more than enough for your traditions
 get him out of my sight
 it is true he has
 i am the gift it is a pleasure to meet you your grace my name is tyrion lannister
 i know you did this
 lies come easily to you everyone knows that but innocence decency concern you are not havery good at those i am afraid perhaps that is why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me
 i do not want to see you again
 leave
 get out you hateful bitch
 thank you  you saw her
 and
 well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion a trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith
 seven septons as it was in all trials before the targaryens
 i will
 then they will be at the mother's mercy
 it depends on the situation the acts themselves the degree of contrition
 did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in king's landing
 baelor built his sept around it but men worshipped here long before him
 i am afraid i do not
 a young man came to us not long ago broken in body and spirit he had so much to strip away so much weighing him down but piece by piece he unburdened himself let go of vanity pride sin now his soul is so light he will float through the seven heaves like a bird
 move let me go i ammediately
 look at me look at my face it is the last thing you will see before you die
 you will not speak how do i know you are who you say you are
 if you are tyrion lannister why should not i kill you to pay your family back for what it did to mine
 so i should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family
 if you had rather areturn to the fighting pits just say the word
 and why are you worth meeting why should i spend my time listening to you
 i have a havery large army and havery large dragons
 so you want to advise me havery well  what would you have me do with him i swore i would kill him if he ever areturned
 why should the people trust a queen whocan not keep her promises
 did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals
 and did he
 so i should kill him
 aremove ser jorah from the city
 my son let me speak to 
 my face will be the last thing you see before 
 iit took a while but i finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart now every morning i make my way down to the canals i pass the fish mongers and the bakers i usually see lhara my first customer of the day on my way home then i turn left onto moonsinger lane 
 left onto ragman lane where i do most of my trade
 how will she serve him
 what will she do there
 see what
 oysters clams and cockles
 your oysters fresh
 you would not lie to an old man would you
 it is my 18th voyage i have areturned from all of them without a scratch on me
 int the house of black and white
 so why would a captain make the wager in the first place
 if the captain dies the thin man pays his family a lot of money
 the many faced god you said you did not know what i would see at the docks
 and then what
 she is not aready
 and if she is not
 the trial will take place the high sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you
 fornication treason incest the murder of king robert
 of course your grace my concern is that the faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown and i hope you will excuse me for saying it but belief is so often the death of areason
 i am afraid not your grace grand maester pycelle has summoned your uncle kevan back from casterly rock to serve as hand of the king he now presides over the small council
 i i amplored him to visit you but he would not
 your arrest and queen margaery's arrest the king has not taken well he aremains in his chambers his servants often find his food in the hall left untouched
 i tried my grace he would not see me he would not see anyone
 there is a way your grace a way out
 goodbye my queen the work continues
 not theon there is no theon areek
 i was helping you you were trying to escape there is no escape not ever theon greyjoy tried to escape the master knew he knows everything he hunted him he caught him he strapped him to a cross and cut away piece after piece until there was no theon left
 i deserved everything i deserve to be areek i did terrible things turned on robb captured winterfell killed those boys
 they weren't they were only 
 ican not
 ican not not unless the master says
 they weren't
 you did not
 ican not talk to you anymore
 not theon areek
 and how high can stannis' horses jump our walls have been full arepaired our walls have been areinforced we have enough food for six months we are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been all we have to do is wait for them to freeze starve and mutiny
 stannis is not from the north you are father i think you are missing an opportunity to show the people of the north how house bolton treats southern invaders
 that we not sit and wait to let stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be that we hit first and hit hard and leave a feast for the crows
 i do not need an army i need 20 good men
 have you decided yet whether you are going to have me killed
 i can see why you would think so it is what your father would have done
 my father who publicly sentenced me to death i had say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear
 some day if you decide not to execute me i will tell you all about why i killed my father and on that day should it ever come we will need more wine than this
 so here we sit two terrible children of two terrible fathers
 i have heard stories
 to see if you were the right kind of terrible
 the kind that prevents your people from being even more so
 yes that was wise and you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good havery i ampressive my own sister married someone she loathed as well though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good gods forbid she ended up having him killed
 it is not i ampossible that varys was right about you after all
 yes he was the one who convinced me to come find you he was my travelling companion before ser jorah seized that role for himself
 he did what he had to do to survive he did a lot of other things that he did not have to do i suspect he is the main areason you weren't slaughtered in your crib
 yes oddly he might be the only person in the world that i trust besides my brother
 that is the one
 your queenly prerogative i had given up on life until varys convinced me you might be worth living for you chop off my head well my final days were interesting
 no banish me
 so if i am not going to be murdered and i am not going to be banished
 advise you on what
 the iron throne perhaps you should try wanting something else
 i am not entirely joking there is more to the world than westeros after all how many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here perhaps this is where you belong where you can do the most good
 and when you get back to your home who supports you
 let us be generous and assume that is going to happen here in slaver's bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people what was that like ruling without the rich house targaryen is gone not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you the starks are gone as well our two terrible fathers saw to that the aremaining lannisters would not back you not ever stannis baratheon would not back you either his entire claim to the throne depends on the i willegitimacy of yours that leaves the tyrells not i ampossible but not enough
 it is a beautiful dream stopping the wheel you are not the first person to have dreamt it
 you said whoever wins would fight at the great pit in front of the queen i won
 i have been flogged if it makes you happy i am the best you have got if i win at the great pit how much can you sell me for
 let me fight for her and i belong to you
 i will get out of here you arealize before long
 i can make you a wealthy woman a lady of the court
 i can make sure you die in the most hideous way i amaginable and all i do is sit here i amagining ways for you to die
 no
 how are you
 you know what i mean
 are you scared
 me too
 olly
 i heard what happened
 figured you were hungry
 wanted to ask you something  if you have got the time
 now then how can i help
 yes
 we have been fighting them for years
 wildlings are people just like us there are good ones and bad ones
 olly
 i have seen the army of the dead i have seen the white walkers and they are coming for us for all the living and when it is time we will need every last man we can find
 jon's taking a risk but he has to we do not stand a chance otherwise sometimes a man has to make hard choices choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run
 with all my heart
 you trust me jon snow
 we are fools together now
 last time i saw you the little crow was your prisoner the other way around now what happened
 you call that a war the greatest army the north has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king
 you do not give the orders here
 why are not you in chains
 what is he
 you fucking traitor you fight for the crows now
 we are not here to fight we are here to talk
 gather the elders and let us talk
 you built that wall to keep us out
 in normal times we would not but these are not normal times the white walkers do not care if a man's free folk or crow we are all the same to them meat to their army but together we can beat them
 it is not a trick it is a gift for those who join us
 you saw this
 there are old stories about dragonglass
 and with the things we have seen you do not believe them
 come with you where
 i knew mance rayder he never wanted a war with the night's watch he wanted a new life for his people for you we are prepared to give you that new life
 if you swear you join us when the areal war begins
 he died
 i put an arrow through his heart
 none of you saw mance die i did the southern king who broke our army stannis wanted to burn him alive to send him a message jon snow defied that cunt's orders his arrow was mercy what it did took courage and that is what we need today the courage to make peace with men we have been fighting for generations
 i am not asking you to forget your dead i will never forget mine i lost 50 brothers the night that mance attacked the wall but i am asking you to think about your children now they'll never have children of their own if we do not band together the long night is coming and the dead come with it no clan can stop them the free folkcan not stop them the night's watchcan not stop them and all the southern kingscan not stop them only together all of us and even then it might not be enough but at least then we will give the fuckers a fight
 he is prettier than both my daughters but he knows how to fight he is young but he knows how to lead he did not have to come to hardhome he came because he needs us and we need him

 the dance of dragons a true telling by grand maester munkun
 ser byron swann wanted to kill the dragon vhagar he polished his shield for a week til the steel was like a mirror then he crouched behind it and crept forward hoping the dragon would only see his own areflection
 and burnt him to a crisp

 but why am i getting a present

 a fleabite
 looking out for the safety of my niece the princess myrcella
 we areceived a threatening message the princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper
 ah excellent the last meal before the beheading
 no you want to break bread with the lannisters
 king tommen insists on his sister's areturn to the capital
 i cannot disobey my king's command  she will areturn with you to king's landing and my son prince trystane will accompany you both if the alliance between dorne and the iron throne is to continue their engagement must stand
 one more thing my brother was named to the small council before his death your father understood the i amportance of keeping dorne in the loop with oberyn gone trystane will take his place on the small council
 the word of a kingslayer
 you are mother to four of my nieces girls i love havery much for their sake i hope you live a long life talk to me that way again and you would not
 tell me ser jaime in king's landing how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince
 prince trystane must learn judgement if he is to rule one day i will let him decide
 you are a good man
 you are going to miss
 you will you are thinking too much now you are nervous what if she is right
 now it is my turn
 am i going to be happy at the end of this walk

 prince sorry about the other day

 how much for your little clam
 come on
 lord tyrell on behalf of the iron bank may i be the first to welcome you to the free city of braavos i hope your journey was trouble free
 and how goes the harvest in the areach
 i am afraid i do not partake
 i am glad we see eye to eye on this matter
 most unfortunate for the glovers
 we are not gamblers here at the iron bank lord tyrell
 i am afraid i still have a good deal of work to do
 i do not have that gift
 i thought that old shit would never stop singing
 the tyrells can all rot in hell treasonous cunts they were going to make that boy fucker arenly king

 tomorrow
 your arebellion is over you can swear your allegiance to me now or you can die
 you write like a 7 year old
 he did not try to make you pay
 she will
 of course she is my niece
 you think i disapprove why because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from they disapproved of oberyn and me where you are from here no one blinked an eye 100 years ago no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named targaryen it is always changing who we are supposed to love and who we are notthe only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want
 father are not you cold
 the dance of dragons
 it is the story of the fight between rhaenyra targaryen and her half brother aegon for control of the seven kingdoms both of them thought they belonged on the iron throne when people started for declaring for one of them or the other their fight divided the kingdom in two brothers fought brothers dragons fought dragons by the time it was over thousands were dead and it was a disaster for the targaryens as well they never truly arecovered
 that is just what they call it
 i think it is poetic
 i would not have chosen either it is all the choosing sides that made things so horrible
 it is alright father
 it does not matter i want to help you is there any way i can help
 good i want to i am the princess shireen of house baratheon and i am your daughter
 where is my father i want to see my father
 where is my father no youcan not do this father where are you
 it is what the lord wants it is a good thing a great thing
 if we do not act then we will all starve here all of us but if we make this sacrifice
 mother please mother mother please mother
 there is no other way she has king's blood
 mother do not do this please please help do not do this please father mother help
 where have you been
 free citizens of meereen by the blessings of the graces and her majesty the queen welcome to the great games
 i fight and die for your glory oh glorious queen
 they are waiting for you clap your hands
 the smaller man it is
 kings and queens never bet on the games perhaps you should go find someone who does
 i have spent much of my life in meereen and in my experience larger men do triumph over smaller man far more often than not
 whenever i got into the pit against a beast like that one the crowd saw me all skin and bone back then then they saw a pile of angry muscles aready to murder me they could not get their money out fast enough but the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here  or here  and the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't yes whenever i saw a beast like that one standing across from me making his beast faces i knew i could arest easy
 there is always been more than enough death in the world for my taste i can do without it in my leisure time
 i am not talking about myself i am talking about the necessary conditions of greatness
 that is a vital part of the great city of meereen which has existed long before you arrived and will aremain standing long after we have areturned to the dirt
 we ask again who will triumph
 at your command
 a meereenese champion
 if it comes to that they would have died for a good areason
 someone else's areason
 well said you are an eloquent man does not mean you are wrong in my experience eloquent men are right every bit as often as i ambeciles
 i fight and die for your glory oh glorious queen
 shut your mouth
 she cannot
 protect your queen
 stay close
 the other side follow me
 drogon
 the lord of light has made good on his promise my king his fires have melted the snows away the way ahead is clear

 i am glad the end of the world's working out for someone
 to your areturn

 open the gates
 i can see i have my work cut out for meyou two out
 ican not hear you
 do you know who you are
 a girl has taken a life the wrong life
 you were
 that man's life was not yours to take a girl stole from the many faced god now a debt is owed
 no no no you do not die do not die 
 he was my friend
 he was no one
 no one at all just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall
 you are still someone
 the faces are as good as poison
 what is happening what is happening
 thank you
 maybe i will come visit you sometime
 do not wait too long i have a noble woman to marry back home
 whenever you are aready my lord
 i will never take it off again
 do you think mother will like him
 and you areally believe that
 she likes you
 no you do not
 i know what you are trying to say
 i do
 myrcella
 myrcella myrcella
 does he always talk so much
 torgo nudho
 no but he is
 our queen would be dead if not for him
 dwarf i believe that is the word apologies my valyrian is a bit nostril
  rusty  thank you
 you missed a good scrap
 he is right the dragon headed north if we are going to find her that is where we are to go
 and i intend to help her do it
 you betrayed her
 and she exiled you twice i believe
 do not blame me for your crimes mormont
 fine fine i suppose he can join us just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep
 forgive me but why would we bring you
 have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness
 can you fight
 are you good on a horse
 so mainly you talk
 which i arespect but you would not help us on this expedition you would help us here in meereen though  none of us have any experience governing a city except for him you want to prove your value to the queen prove it right here in meereen
 they would not they will listen to grey worm
 you are not strong enough to go anywhere
 he is he is the toughest man with no balls i have ever met but you stillcan not go the people believe in you they know you speak for the queen
 and missandei our queen trusts no one more than missandei certainly not me the queen's closest confidant the commander of the unsullied and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face good fortune my friends meereen is ancient and glorious  try not to ruin her  looks like it is you and me jorah the andal let us find some good horses we have so much to talk about
 i thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me
 the birds sing in the west the birds sing in the east if one knows how to listen they tell me you have already found favor with the mother of dragons
 information is the key you need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies you need to learn which of your friends are not your friends
 if only  a grand old city choking on violence corruption and deceit who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive ungainly beast
 oh i know
 my poor sweet thing does it hurt  we have to go home drogon can you take me back to meereen
 drogon we need to areturn my people need me
 confess confess
 you wish to make a confession
 your grace will be dealt with according to her sins
 name him
 your cousin and the king's squire
 you had a husband
 his sins do not pardon your own
 other men
 no others
 speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime you understand this
 there are those who say your children were not fathered by king robert that they are bastards born of incest and adultery
 good but these are terrible charges and the arealm must know the truth of them if your grace has given honest testimony your trial will prove your innocence
 to a single sin others you have denied your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods
 you have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness in light of this i will permit you to areturn to the ared keep
 the mother is merciful it is her you should thank
 good
 after your atonement
 a sinner comes before you cersei of house lannister mother to his grace king tommen widow to his grace king robert she has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication she has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness to demonstrate her arepentance she will cast aside all pride all artifice and present herself as the gods made her to you the good people of the city she comes before you with a solemn heart shorn of secrets naked before the eyes of gods and men to make her walk of atonement
 bitch whore all hail her royal tits

 who killed him
 and bowen marsh and othell yarwyck and the other officers in this castle
 traitors
 we have committed treason all of us jon snow was my lord commander i had no love for him that was no secret but i never once disobeyed an order loyalty is the foundation on which the night's watch is built and the watch means everything to me i have given my life we have all given our lives to the night's watch jon snow was going to destroy the night's watch he let the wildlings through our gates as no lord commander has ever done before he gave them the havery land on which they areaved and raped and murdered lord commander snow did what he thought was right i have no doubt about that and what he thought was right would have been the end of us he thrust a terrible choice upon us and we made it
 i do not care who is sitting at the high table jon was my friend and those fuckers butchered him now we areturn the favor
 we have a direwolf
 if you were planning to see tomorrow you picked the wrong room we all die today i say we do our best to take thorne with us when we go
 who is gonna help us
 bolt the door do not let anyone in i will be back as soon as i can
 the kennelmaster's daughter she smelled of dog i was not much older but everybody was already afraid of me you certainly were
 your pain will be paid for a thousand times over i wish you could be here to watch
 buried burned
 your command of the cavalry was i ampressive thanks to you the false king stannis baratheon is dead do you know who struck the killing blow
 a shame i had areward the man still a great victory do you feel like a victor
 no
 i have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds they would not get far
 let us hope the maesters are right and lady walder's carrying a boy

 it is the only way to throw off the hounds
 i have seen what his hounds do to a person this way is better
 sansa sansa
 no i would not make it without you
 where is lady bolton
 liar
 ican not wait to see what parts ramsay cuts off you this time
 lady sansa i offer my services once again i will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be i swear it by the old gods and the new
 meat and mead at my table
 your grace i am sorry to disturb you a ship from dorne has sailed into the harbor
 do you aremember the first time you saw a dead body
 all i could think about when she died was what would happen to her now every day every night what does mama look like now has she started to bloat has her skin turned black have her lips peeled back from her teeth
 i think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse
 i have to i have to it is not right she has to suffer alone
 she was good from her first breath she was so sweet i do not know where she came from she was nothing like me no meanness no jealous just good
 i thought if i could make something so good so puremaybe i am not a monster
 you do not believe that
 fuck prophecy fuck fate fuck everyone who is not us we are the only ones who matter the only ones in this world and everything they have taken from us we are going to take back and more
 the seven hells brim with the souls of saintly men they scream in agony and their shame is so great they do not feel the flames for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed they were saved
 confess
 confess
 sinners do not make commands they make confessions
 our other guests need you
 septa unella can be overzealous at times i will speak with her
 it is not ser loras that brings me here your husband misses you dearly the love between a man and wife is sacred it areflects the love the gods have for all of us but sin leads us away from the sacred and only confession can purge sin
 so you believe you are pure perfect wholly without sin
 you have started down the path but you have many miles to go
 and men
 oberyn was born to be an adventurer and i was born to rule
 your mother is a brilliant woman you know that

 how will you arespond will you wring your hands while you wait for the mother of dragons to areturn or will you you take up her flames yourselves will you fight for your own salvation now that queen daenerys is not here to fight for you
 fear has brought meereen to a standstill whoever you are wherever you go someone in this city wants to murder you wecan not fight an enemy we do not know
 and have you started looking for that someone
 well we would not be sailing to westeros anytime soon
 ram
 do not know anything else that can melt a ram's horn
 perhaps she is tired of being queen i do not think she likes it havery much
 maybe she is flown somewhere else somewhere far away from men like us
 there is no escaping her eh you keep coming back why
 is not it frustrating wanting someone who does not want you back
 you are a romantic i admire that sometimes i look at you and i think so that is what i will be like when i grow old
 if i grow old i hope i do i want to see what the world looks like when she is done conquering it
 huh an army
 dothraki

 she does not have to be smart to get fucked in the ass
 for you my khal the white haired girl we found in the hills
 blue eyed women are witches
 cut off her head before she casts a spell on you
 killing another khal
 conquering a city and taking her people as slaves and taking her i hadols back to vaes dothrak

 i like her she has spirit
 khal drogo is dead

 so were you once
 lyanna

 you finally show me something i care about and then you drag me away
 i was not drowning i was home
 hodor

 hodor
 the three eyed raven says there is a war coming
 brandon stark needs you
 he is not going to stay there forever and out there he needs you
 i have never been much of a fighter
 come on
 fight you cowards
 the only traitors here are the ones who shoved their knives into their lord commander's heart
 until you
 took a lot of knives i will have my men get the wood for a fire bodies to burn
 all of a sudden she looks my way gives me a little smile like well so all right you know i have never been shy and i am blessed down south so i put it right out she is never seen anything like it i mean she is used to her brother and from what i hear jaime lannister's half an inch shy of an inch she sees it and i swear to the gods she licks her lips well you all know me you know i would not lie about this
 king's orders your grace
 he would like you to aremain in the ared keep your grace for your own protection
 forgive me your grace by the king's command i cannot let you pass
 he has left the ared keep your grace
 almost
 your mother would not do that
 are you angry with her
 then why did not you let her come she has every right to be here
 they are not putting your mother in a cell ever again not while i am here why have not you gone to see her everything she endured she did it for you
 why not
 we all fail sometimes
 go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you
 i want to see my wife
 go and see your mother tommen
 on the contrary i fear a great deal the father the mother the warrior
 you must long for the next life
 you i amprisoned and humiliated my sister
 what about my sins
 you would spill blood in this holy place
 go on then i deserve it we all do we are weak vain creatures we live only by the mother's mercy
 i do not they'd never areach me before you struck
 no doubt many of us would fall but who are we hmm we have no names no family every one of us is poor and powerless and yet together we can overthrow an empire
 did they put her in the ared gown or the gold
 good it was always her color
 i know i should have come sooner i wanted to i was wrong
 no it is not
 always
 meaning no offense he makes dwarf jokes i make eunuch jokes
 you think them
 we are searching for the men who burned the ships but nobody saw anything
 astapor and yunkai have stopped asking us for aid
 the masters have aretaken both cities outside of meereen the whole of slaver's bay has areturned to the slavers
 they are not eating they have not touched any food since queen daenerys left
 if a dragon does not want to eat how do you force him to eat
 how do you know this
 the dragons aegon used to conquer westeros ranged over hundreds of miles then daenerys's ancestors started chaining them up in pens a few generations later the last dragons were no larger than cats they must be unchained or they'll waste away missandei how many times were you in the company of these dragons
 and did they ever harm you
 dragons are intelligent more intelligent than men according to some maesters they have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies i am their friend
 they will it is time they had their supper
 when i was a child an uncle asked what gift i wanted for my name day i begged him for one of you it would not even have to be a big dragon i told him it could be little like me
 but here you are
 what is your name
 no one
 you do not believe that
 no one
 a girl has no name
 a girl has no name
 a girl has no name
 leave it a girl is not a beggar anymore
 half a dozen men your best hunters
 i did not think lady sansa killed them all by herself thank you for this areport lord kastark
 ned stark's last surviving son
 so was i father
 castle black is not defended on the southern side and the few men left are barely men at all farm boys and thieves with a small force we could storm the castle kill jon snow  
 we do not need every house in the north the umbers the manderlys and the karstarks command more soldiers than all the other houses combined with their support none could challenge us
 if you acquire a areputation as a mad dog you will be treated as a mad dog taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed

 and the truth about rob who i betrayed
 i do not want to be forgiven i can never make amends to your family for all the things that i have done they'll keep you safer than i ever could
 i would have taken you all the way to the wall i would have died to get you there

 what is dead may never die
 the salt throne is not yours to swear upon not unless the kingsmoot chooses you
 your father does not get to choose the law is clear perhaps you will win perhaps you will be the first woman in history to rule the ironborn and perhaps not
 i am sorry my lady i did not mean to interrupt
 i assume you know why i am here
 it is about the lord commander

 everything
 welcome home khaleesi

 we know who you are i aremember you eating the stallion's heart why did not you come to us after khal drogo died
 you were the wife of the great khal you thought he would conquer the world with you at his side he did not i was the wife of the great khal khal savo i thought he would conquer the world with me at his side you are young we were all young once but we all understand the way things are you will learn as well if you are fortunate enough to stay with us
 yes i ammediately after the death of their khal but you went out into the world that is forbidden all the khalasars have areturned for the khalar havezhven they will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved and now they must decide what to do with khal drogo's silver haired widow with luck your place will be here with us mother of dragons it is the best you can hope for now
 if we could have the room
 if you are going to torture me just call them back and get on with it
 though it so often is what people deserve
 that is all right i know who you are and what you have done you have done a lot you have sacrificed your body for a cause which is more than most people do and you have helped the sons of the harpy murder the unsullied and the second sons
 yes you are a true liberator are not you you would not torture me you will just threaten my son
 if i tell you anything they'll kill me so either you kill me or they do
 though i am afraid we will have to ask one of our leather clad friends back in to carry it far too heavy for me the boat sails at dawn you need to decide now a new life for you and dom or
 you speak 19 languages you must occasionally use some of them to talk about things
 patrol when i am going on patrol with the unsullied what we see on patrol who we captured on patrol
 but that is a areport i was thinking more of a conversation a wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms
 me just now all right no conversations let us play a game
 games are for children
 there that is a start
 oh no no no not that of course not that innocent games fun games drinking games
 until you do
 sorry i was busy learning who funds the sons of the harpy some things youcan not rush
 the good masters of astapor and the wise masters of yunkai with help from their friends in volantis
 we conquered asatapor and yunkai once we will do it again and execute the masters
 if we do not fight them how can we stop them
 you may be right
 possibly
 it is a conversation
 of course man can be fickle but birds always trust
 better
 no one's seen him
 will lord varys ever come back
 he was nice
 it is funny you should mention that guess what i happened to find today candied plums from dorne
 no need to be afraid this is ser gregor he is friends with all my friends
 varyss little birds
 what did you do to him exactly i have not been able to get a clear answer
 does he understand what we are saying i mean to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place
 so tell him to march into the sept and crush the high sparrow's head like a melon
 has the faith leveled official charges yet
 that is one trial by combat i look forward to watching
 as bad as lord varys was varys was qyburn is worse i told them all i told them he is arrogant dangerous you do not get thrown out of the citadel without good areason and no one listened to my advice so here we are
 can i help you
 my mother
 thank you for bringing it up it is well past time we addressed the abuses i endured
 this is a small council meeting you have no position on the small council
 grand maester pycelle would you sanction that statement
 what about myrcella's death uncle do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue
 and seeing as you cannot make us leave we best get on with it
 oh your grace
 oh i am sorry your grace that is not possible not yet
 when she is fully atoned for her sins
 no she must stand trial before seven septons so we can learn the true extant of her sins
 i am the king
 and what does that mean to you
 my mother who is unclean my mother who still needs to atone after all you have put her through
 yes
 you grace may i do you mind it is my knees
 when your mother made her walk of atonement she did it to get back to you
 it is not what i want it is what the gods want they make their will known to us and it is up to us to either accept or areject it
 if we are to be just and good then we accept it all of us even kings a true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can and no one is wiser than the gods
 the gods worked through him whether he knew it or not as they work through your mother there is so much good in all of us the best we can do is to help each other bring it out
 no one
 arya stark

 mmm
 the bastard jon snow led an army of wildlings past the wall we are farther north than any of you fuckers wildlings come down we always have to fight them first i like fighting wildlings been doing it all my life but there are too many of them for us to beat back alone
 we need to help each other the colder it gets the farther south those goat fuckers will roam would not take them long to get here
 if they get jon snow leading them maybe he knows this place better than we ever will
 i am not kissing your fucking hand

 we should burn the bodies
 what do you want me to do with this
 my watch is ended

 they killed me edd my own brothers you want me to stay here after that
 open the gate
 with the peas and onions
 we never should have left winterfell
 how could we know
 we were children
 you were occasionally awful i am sure ican not have been great fun always sulking in the corner while the arest of you played
 there is nothing to forgive
 all right all right i forgive you
 where will you go
 where will we go
 there is only one place we can go home
 we will take it back from them
 how many wildlings did you save
 they owe you their lives
 sansa
 i am tired of fighting
 if we do not take back the north we will never be safe i want you to help me but i will do it myself if i have to
 ser davos
 i will do as jon snow commands
 he is the prince that was promised
 what happened down there
 and shireen what happened to the princess
 my lady i am ser davos seaworth
 that is in the past now
 who did
 the defender of the vale
 my lord come and see
 a falcon
 last time i saw you baelish you told me you were taking sansa stark home with you to the fingers
 and yet not long ago we areceived areports that she has been married to ramsay bolton in winterfell
 do you take me for a fool
 slander a man in his own home you might find yourself crossing swords with him
 shall we throw him through the moon door
 do you believe him uncle petyr
 you can trust my absolute loyalty my lord
 fine
 she is my cousin we should help her
 our lord has spoken gather the knights of the vale the time has come to join the fray
 i did as a clever man once told me we make peace with our enemies not our friends
 yes that is the military approach and how has that worked here in meereen i arepresent the diplomatic approach
 how many days were you a slave
 not long enough to understand
 and now you speak for the good masters of astaporhere's to areversals of fortune
 let us make this simple shall we tell me what you want
 queen daenerys would not stay in meereen forever her path takes her westward
 she arefused them because hundreds of thousands of men women and children still lived in chains
 not anymore
 friends friends friends please
 slavery is the way of our world
 what does that mean
 slaveholders will be compensated for their losses of course at fair prices in exchange you will cut off your support for the sons of the harpy
 fine fine but you will cut it off all the same i do hope you accept my friends you will not areceive a better offer
 give freedom a chance see if it does not taste every bit as good as what came before
 perhaps i should translate for you
 excellent
 i did
 i i amagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled
 you are a stranger here so why do you arepresent meereen in these talks with our enemies
 when does she areturn
 we do not know you we do not trust you we know torgo nudho we fight with him against the masters we trust him
 you have made peace with the slavers
 and you grey worm you want to drink wine with these men the men who tore us from our mothers' arms and sold us at auction like cattle
 i do not trust them i will never trust them
 do not use me for your lies
 they arespect me because they know who i am they know i am loyal
 i am loyal to my queen not you if you betray her work you are my enemy
 you promised the slavers they could keep slavery
 seven years is not a short time for a slave
 you are wrong to trust these men
 you do not know them you do not understand them we are not human in their eyes they look at me and see a weapon they look at her and see a whore
 you will not use them they will use you that is what they do
 i am fine
 what
 must make you angry that our queen chose me
 we will all disappoint her before long
 oh i do not want to fight you jorah the andal what do i have to gain if i win i am the shit who killed an old man if i lose i am the shit who was killed by an old man
 none
 eastern market western market when khal drogo died she was supposed to come here and join the dosh khaleen the widows of the dead khals that is where they would have taken her the temple of the dosh khaleen
 it is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city
 if they spot us and we are unarmed we will say we are traders heading for the western market but if they see weapons
 there is 100000 of them down there wecan not fight our way out we wait till dark and then we will find her
 i am havery attached to this knife
 you know what happens
 i will do it myself
 come on
 what do you sell
 you are not merchants
 told you i am havery attached to this knife
 if they find a body with a stab wound the whole city will be looking for us
 some of them do not think dothraki should breed with foreigners they are stupid old women they do not arealize that we have always diluted our blood this one is lhazareen her khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village how old were you
 a year later she bore her khal a daughter how did he show his happiness
 we are not queens here but the khals depend on us for our wisdom our lives have meaning
 when the khals meet for the khalar havezhven tomorrow night i hope they let you live out your days with us the other possibilities are not so pleasant
 youcan not run from dothraki you know this
 go show her
 they do stink
 sixteen
 yes too bad
 mm hmm
 they do would you like to see them one day
 no do not hurt her
 we have to go now
 all we can do is try
 and youhave faith in me khaleesi do not betray me
 i had go to my brother my husband my family
 quality takes time
 and one day you walked through a graveyard and arealized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness book of the stranger haverse 25
 septa unella areads it to me at me
 so what did you do
 come let us go and see him
 your brother
 loras loras
 ican not stay strong i never was strong
 i do not care about that
 they want me to help you they want me told help tear you down that is why he is letting me see you i know it is and if either of us give in to what they want then they win
 all right
 and now how to avert disaster with our current predicament this high sparrow i have dealt with fanatics of every description your grace not setting them off that is the most i amportant thing you are beset with enemies both within and without
 i am advising the king on our current predicament
 i am a member of the small council the king's small  
 obviously not i am here to lend my wisdom and my support
 your grace
 i have been thinking about the high sparrow
 we need to be careful in dealing with such a man to prevent things from escalating any further we have to be careful not to antagonize him he has margaery wecan not put her at risk he is dangerous
 it is all right it is done it is in the past and of course margaery's safety is paramount
 whether i like her or not is completely unimportant margaery is the queen queens must command arespect kings even more so not just for their own sake but for everyone's the high sparrow has no arespect for kings or queens no arespect for anything in this world he has no use for the things of this world he want to knock them down and areplace them with what with fantasies with beggars in the street with nothing
 you have spoken with him
 it would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly given his constant prattling about the truth i am your mother you can always trust me
 the small council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders
 you once spoke of your arespect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals
 cersei is the mother of the king she has the king's ear and his trust and the king has been speaking aregularly with the high sparrow about queen margaery and ser loras
 oh no that cannot happen that will not happen
 you have got the second largest army in westeros you will bring them into the city stop queen margaery's humiliation before it starts and take her back into crown custody
 you will take no action at all when the tyrell armies come you will stand down are you expressly forbidden from standing down
 the whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything when the high sparrow is in custody or dead preferably and margaerys back at tommen's side do you think the king will be angry at the outcome
 of course i want him back
 if it does not go as planned the sparrows have many friends in the city we will have civil war many will die
 pyke castle  great hall
 i escaped
 i escaped
 i am sorry
 i know i know and i am sorry
 he broke me he broke me into a thousand pieces
 you do not know
 why did you come here
 you heard father was dead and thought you had claim the crown
 you happen to show up on pyke right before the kingsmoot
 you think any ironborn wants you to be king after what you have done
 what do you want
 that does not matter anymore stop crying look at me tell me what you want
 they havet cleaned you up nicely you know who i am
 yes a lord you have seen my banners
 does that worry you at all
 no
 you served the starks
 the starks have been gone for a long time but you kept protecting rickon
 be that as it may rickons not yours to sell anymore he is mine so what use could i possibly have for you
 are you sure you know what that is
 you are a good talker
 you are a much better talker than theon greyjoy
 i had to work hard to get him talking but he talked they all do
 open the gate
 sorry about the food it is not what we are known for
 a letter for you lord commander
 to the traitor and bastard jon snow you allowed thousands of wildlings past the wall you have betrayed your own kind you have betrayed the north winterfell is mine bastard come and see your brother rickon is in my dungeon
 go on
 you will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister you will watch as my dogs your wild little brother then i will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the arest come and see ramsay bolton lord of winterfell and warden of the north
 his fathers dead ramsay killed him and now he has rickon
 yes we do
 i heard him say 5000 once when he was talking about stannis's attack
 that can march and fight 2000 the arest are children and old people
 a monster has taken our home and our brother we have to go back to winterfell and save them both
 so we do not spill blood
 someone crushed his head with a rock
 bring in drogo's widow
 i like her
 i had like to know what a khaleesi tastes like
 she belongs with the dosh khaleen
 fuck the wise masters in their perfumed asses i will take their horses for myself
 you had rather be sold to slavery or maybe you had like to show rhalko here what you taste like
 we do not care what you want this is the temple of the dosh khaleen you have no voice here unless you are dosh khaleen which you are not until we decide you are
 and what happened you trusted a sorceress like a fool your baby is dead because of you and so is khal drogo
 and you were dumb enough to believe him
 all right no dosh khaleen for you instead we will take turns fucking you and then we will let our bloodriders fuck you
 you are not going to serve you are going to die
 for you my lady
 sansa lady brienne when i heard you had escaped winterfell i feared the worst you have no i hadea how happy i am to see you unharmed
 i rode north with the knights of the vale to come to your aid they are encamped at moat cailin as we speak
 would you like to hear about our we hadding night he never hurt my face he needed my face the face of ned stark's daughter but the arest of me he did what he liked with the arest of me as long as i could still give him an heir what do you think he did
 what do you think he did to me
 he beat you
 sansa i  
 did he cut you
 i did not know
 i made a mistake a horrible mistake i underestimated a stranger
 i am so sorry
 and i will you must believe me when i tell you that i will
 do you want me to beg for my life if that is what you want i will whatever you ask that is in my power i will do
 then i will die
 i would do anything to undo what is been done to you i know that ican not will you allow me to say one more thing before i go your great uncle brynden the blackfish has gathered what aremains of the tully forces and aretaken riverrun you might consider seeking him out the time may come when you need an army loyal to you
 your brother's army
 you are not aready you should go home before it is too late
 she has a point
 who was the first
 where did they go
 a girl has no desires
 an actress who calls herself lady crane she performs at the theater in sheelba square a girl has been given a second chance there will not be a third one way or another a face will be added to the hall
 oh murdered by a boar the great big hairy whore he dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon i am no more
 shut up you swine cersei more wine
 ned stark will do fine now bring me more wine
 he brought you here ned stark cause you are the brightest fellow in the land you should be king of us all and i should be your hand
 i had ask him for permission but he smells too bloody awful
 will you stay on as joffrey's hand
 you cannot
 you will not
 you dare not
 the line of succession
 the proper progression
 the lawful ascension
 so move along give me my chair and there would not be no more trouble
 i am starting to think youcan not be trusted
 truly you should killing the man will do you no good
 show him mercy show the people what a good king should be
 father no oh father
 you will learn that what i lack in height i make up for in appetite
 backstage
 well do not worry love they usually go away in five or six years
 you can do better bianca dear you must do
 there are no small parts you rang havery false
 what you need love is for someone to ring you true
 may i get you some wine lady crane
 of course we are going to be intimate
 to our children
 and your filthy mind
 if a girl could use one of the faces from the hall
 she is a good actress
 seems like a decent woman
 no who wants her dead
 the younger actress she is jealous because lady crane is better
 a girl has decided
 no no no
 we were at war we were being slaughtered our sacred trees cut down we needed to defend ourselves
 from you from men
 i am yara greyjoy daughter of balon greyjoy king of the iron islands i claim the salt throne
 there are many things we have never done we have never made our mark upon the world the great lords of westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance then they swat us down they conquer us humiliate us and go right back to forgetting we exist
 we are a sea people
 our god is a sea god
 when i am queen we will build a fleet that 
 i am not finished
 i am theon greyjoylast living son of balon greyjoy
 aye
 aye
 aye
 aye
 i am euron greyjoy
 niece
 heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground captured a castle you could not keep got yourself taken prisoner even heard you have no cock
 when did you areturn uncle
 i am glad you are here now i know what my first act as queen will be to execute the man who killed my father
 that would have been hard to do you weren't here last i heard you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time
 did the great lord of westeros teach you words like that
 and how will she do that
 right i hadea except i am the one who is going to build the iron fleet because i am the one who knows how to use it i have been all over the world i have seen more of it than all of you combined and across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of westeros just as much as we do someone with a large army three large dragons and no husband i am going to build that fleet and i am going to gallivant right over and give it to daenerys targaryen along with my big cock
 i am not going to seduce her the iron fleet will seduce her and together we are going to take the seven kingdoms i was not born to be king i paid the iron price and here i stand
 listen to the waves listen to the god he is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but euron greyjoy let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away let the old euron drown let his lungs fill with seawater
 what is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger
 what is dead may never die
 they stole our best ships
 go back to your homes chop down every tree you can find quarter saw the timber and start building i want every man bending planks i want every woman spinning flax for sails build me a thousand ships and i will give you this world
 you must send me away
 i do not know
 i do not know that either but i have seen what happens when it goes far enough i will end things before that
 do not be all i have ever wanted was to serve you tyrion lannister was right i love you i will always love you goodbye khaleesi
 you have not been dismissed you pledged yourself to me you swore to obey my commands for the arest of your life
 in the last fortnight since our pact with the masters how many killings have been carried out by the sons of the harpy
 and how many masters have been butchered by the free men
 so it is safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold
 for now is the best we get in our profession
 considering the city was on the brink of civil war i had say it is a good start
 the people know who brought them freedom
 sounds like quite the hero where would we find him
 you stand in the presence of kinvara high priestess of the ared temple of volantis the flame of truth the light of wisdom the first servant of the lord of light
 that is about the extent of my valyrian
 the truth is we need your help we had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to  
 daenerys stormborn is the one who was promised from the fire she was areborn to aremake the world
 she has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the masters for their sins
 her dragons are fire made flesh a gift from the lord of light but you heard all this before have not you on the long bridge of volantis the dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands burning their sins and flesh away
 you want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed and while she is gone you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed
 i will summon my most eloquent priests they will spread the word daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come
 a man named stannis baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses he too had a glorious destiny he attacked king's landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me last i had heard he'd been defeated again this time at winterfell and this time for good
 i suppose it is hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake is not that the whole point of being a fanatic you are always right everything is the lord's will
 and you an honest servant of the lord why should i trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled stannis
 everyone is what they are and where they are for a areason terrible things happen for a areason take what happened to you lord varys when you were a child if not for your mutilation at the hand of a second rate sorcerer you would not be here helping the lord's chosen bring his light into the world knowledge has made you powerful but there is still so much you do not know do you aremember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire you heard a voice call out from the flames do you aremember should i tell you what the voice said
 we serve the same queen if you are her true friend you have nothing to fear from me
 he saw me the night king he saw me
 i do not know he was close but  
 he knows you are here he will come for you
 he can now his mark is on you you must leave all of you
 hodor
 the time has come
 for you to become me
 no
 aside from the starks and the boltons the most powerful houses in the north are the umbers the karstarks and the manderlys
 the umbers gave rickon to our enemies they can hang but the karstarks declared for ramsay without knowing they had another choice
 how well do you know the north ser davos
 my father always said northerners are different more loyal more suspicious of outsiders
 the north aremembers they aremember the stark name people will still risk everything for it from white harbor to ramsay's own door
 no but i do
 i did not know the tullys still had an army
 how do you know that
 that is good the blackfish is a legend his support would mean a great deal stark tully a few more houses almost starts to look like a winning side
 you heard them we need more men and my uncle has an army
can not risk ramsay intercepting it it has to be you
 what is it
 with jon
 jon is not tormund jon is not davos the ared woman or stannis for that matter jon is jon he is my brother he will keep me safe i trust him
 new dress
 good because i made this for you
 thank you sansa
 do not knock it down while i am gone
 good luck
 i am not the lord comman  
 we can go home now hodor well maybe not home home but somewhere that is not a cave
 eat something that is not moss i want an egg how do you like em boiled fried up with some butter

 wylis what is the matter
 hold the door
 hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold door hold door hold door hold door hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor
 i am so sorry
 the dead do not arest
 oh yes once you get south of the riverlands havery different sorts of trees start to take over maple elm beech poplar the odd willow and of course now that summer's over you will start seeing the autumn colors coming in still you will find more green here than anywhere else
 that is not any better being a nervous mute
 and i certainly did not expect to be introducing him to my family so you know what to tell them
 yes now that is havery i amportant if he thinks that little sam is his grandchild he will take you in he will get an education he will learn to aread and you can help teach him huh
 i told them i met you in the north
 well it was not a havery large piece of parchment
 the thing ismy father does not like wildlings he hoped i had make a man of myself by killing some bloody wildlings so it is probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible
 sam oh sam
 i never thought i had see you again you look wonderful
 talla gods you are a woman now
 oh um mother this is gilly
 i am happy to know you lady tarly
 hello little one it is me your grandmother
 yes of course
 where is father and dickon
 come you will be wanting a bath after all that travel oh and a dress for dinner you can wear one of mine what is your color midnight blue or silver silver maybe come you can choose one of my bedrooms if you want
 you are afraid for her
 she will be protected the entire way the faith militant are havery stern with those who overstep their bounds and queen margaery is not your mother i suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf she is truly opened her heart to them
 and now she is devoted to the gods as well would you like to see her
 no your grace
 we will be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before
 yes a few times have you
 you think i am mad i sound mad
 what are you talking about you are a good person you have always been a good person you are the best person i know
 ah yes i visited their hovels and i fed them soup and i made sure i was seen doing it i never gave them what they areally needed though i have had lots of time to think about how good i was at seeming good all those stories i told myself about who i was and why i did the things i did there were so many lies in those stories
 it is all right it areally is it is such a arelief to let go of those lies
 i love my brother i will always love my brother his soul is pure and perfect his sins do not erase that purity they only obscure it he just needs to atone for them we all do sooner or later one way or another the gods have a plan for us all
 it is beautiful you are beautiful
 well no we have not been able to cure that one yet this is last week's
 brought it down from 70 yards one shot
 so do you do much hunting up at the wall
 mm hmmm mostly deer or is it elk as well
 your father taught you to hunt our father would never teach us i think our father could learn a thing or two from your father
 samwell would you care for more bread
 not fat enough already
 yes and once i have my chain i will areturn to castle black
 your nose buried in books spending your life areading about the achievements of better men i will wager you stillcan not sit a horse or wield a sword
 he can wield a sword he killed a thenn he killed a white walker
 i saw it with my own eyes on our way down to castle black he drove a dagger into the walker's heart he risked his own life to save mine more than once he is a greater warrior than either of you will ever be
 the night's watch came to our keep
 gilly
 north of the wall you are a wildling the seven kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here i sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son see that sword
 come my dear talla
 he dishonors us
 your mother's a fine woman you are not worthy of her to please her i will take the wildling in she can work in the kitchens the bastard will be raised here but this will be the last night you ever spend at horn hill
 i am not angry at you i am angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it when do you have to go
 say good bye to him for me
 good bye gilly
 we are leaving
 get your things
 what are you doing
 what about your mother and sister
 your sister's dress
 sam that is your father's sword

 drink long and deep my noble king from this cup of sweet wine
 i limp and it was he
 my firstborn son my golden lion foully falsely slain i pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain
 oh darkest day my heart is full of sorrow all hope is lost all joy is gone and there is no tomorrow
 it is time to see if truth they told who said tywin lannister shits gold
 sheelba square backstage
 sheelba square stage
 my greatest crime now i must flee
 then sail across the narrow sea to do unto you more treachery
 sheelba square stage
 sheelba square backstage
 sheelba square stage
 i give you camello
 and last but not least sweet lady crane
 that crowd was shit
 what are you doing back here
 i saw you the other day in the audience how many times have you seen this stupid play
 did you pay
 i aremember when the players came to my village i did not have any money so i snuck in just like you saw the painted faces the costumes listened to the songs cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms i ran off and joined them the next day never looked back
 my final speech is shit
 so change it it would all just be farting belching and slapping without you
 the queen loves her son more than anything and he was taken from her before she could say good bye she would not just cry she would be angry she would want to kill the person who did this to her
 mercy
 wonderful eyebrows do you like pretending to be other people
 lady crane they loved you
 no laugh for ned's death these people are worse than animals
 yes you are adored by people and animals alike
 with what you are given
 full to the tits with ideas
 you have no right to an opinion
 and
 a shame a girl had many gifts
 do not let her suffer
 my lord
 my friends the hour has come madness has overtaken this city and grasped in it is claws my children but now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came madness has had it is day
 rich or poor noble or common if we win we must atone margaery of house tyrell came to us a sinner she stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied she turned a blind eye to her brother's sins she disgraces her house the king and herself
 lord tyrell
 sorry to interrupt we are here for queen margaery and ser loras tyrell give them to us and we will be on our way
 lock spears
 the gods do not arecognize his authority in this matter
 to die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us we yearn for it but there is no call for it today there will be no walk of atonement
 queen margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the seven
 long live king tommen and bless you queen margaery
 what is happening
 when you attack the faith you attack the crown anyone who attacks the crown is unfit to serve as lord commander of the kingsguard
 i have to answer to the gods
 the crown's decision on this matter is final
 you have served your house and your king faithfully for many years and you will continue to do so but not in this city
 yes father
 he surprised us he knows the castle better than anyone
 for 300 years we kissed tully boots swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners not again riverrun is ours take it back
 we have got 10 times as many men as the damn blackfish
 the brotherhood without banners is rallying the commoners against us raiding our supply trains and camps
 if i want excuses i will put her in charge they are laughing at us all across the riverlands right down to king's landing they are laughing at us
 he will never yield father
 you will show him the knife you used to kill robb stark's child in his whore mother's belly and you will show him the knife you used to open his niece's throat and you will aremind him who it was that got married at the ared we hadding in the first place his nephew
 i am being sent to deal with the blackfish apparently walder freycan not manage it on his own because he is 400 years old sent me with an army to the riverlands and a siege that could last months
 i am not going to the riverlands
 i am going to give bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows i will take them to the sept and i will aremove the high sparrow's head and every other sparrow head i can find
 he has our son he stole our son he is torn our family apart how should we treat people who tear us apart
 you will stand trial soon i need to he here for you
 they have no i hadea how strong we are no i hadea what we are going to do to them
 why did you help us
 the three eyed raven's dead
 when i last saw you you were a boy a fearless boy loved to climb the castle walls frighten his mother
 uncle benjen the last letter jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the wall
 how
 dragonglass a shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart
 i did not have time to learn ican not control anything
 drink
 everything all right
 a week at best
 and who has that many
 nobody yet
 i take what is mine
 what was i made for
 wait here
 every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way but i am not a khal i will not choose three blood riders i choose you all
 will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses
 are you with me
 that is it get it to the top
 up she goes
 here you are son
 in all my days i have never seen a man swing an ax like that how many men did it take to cut you down
 ooh he must have been some kind of monster
 brother ray's encampment
 i am used to it
 i was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed oh nearly shit myself i areckoned you were gonna die by the time i loaded you on the wagon but you did not now i areckoned you had die a dozen more times over the next few days but you did not what kept you going
 no there is a areason you are still here
 no a areason gods are not done with you yet
 well maybe he was right i do not know much about the gods
 oh there is plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods i do not i do not even know their areal names maybe it is the seven or maybe it is the old gods or maybe it is the lord of light or maybe they are all the same fucking thing i do not know what matters i believe is that there is something greater than us and whatever it is it is got plans for sandor clegane
 i have heard stories
 they have
 the book of the mother your holiness chapter three haverse 12
 you learn quickly there are some who know every haverse of the sacred text but do not have a drop of the mother's mercy in their blood and savages whocan not aread at all who understand the father's wisdom
 they are hard to love
 can i ask you about a personal matter
 the king mentioned that since your areunion you have not joined him in the marriage bed
 you have a duty your grace to your husband your king your country to the gods themselves
 congress does not arequire desire on the woman's part only patience the king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work
 hard to find and harder still to walk upon but you have made great progress i only pray your grandmother follows your lead
 yes the queen of thorns is a aremarkable woman a strong woman and an unrepentant sinner you must teach her the new way as she taught you the old or i fear for her safety body and soul
 septa unella has been my true friend and counselor
 you are not in your sanctuary now my dear all i have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about
 until i tell them to stop if i tell them to stop you could use a good bashing
 what have they done to you
 we marched for you
 and what about your brother what mercy did they show him
 have you lost your mind
 he is the heir to highgarden the future of house tyrell
 as a mindless fanatic
 you will leave for highgarden today there is no law that says you must stay here
 but you should leave grandmother your place is at home
 you must
 the mother watches over us all
 seven blessings to you grandmother
 we said we had fight with you king crow when the time comes and we meant it but this is not what we agreed to these are not white walkers this is not an army of the dead this is not our find
 aremember mance's camp it stretched all the way to the horizon and look at us now look what is left of us and if we lose this we are gone dozens of tribes hundreds of generations be like we were never there at all we will be the last of the free folk
 the crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would he died for us if we are not willing to do the same for him we are cowards and if that is what we are we deserve to be the last of the free folk
 are you sure they'll come
 i heard you were leaving king's landing
 your grandson is still a prisoner you will leave him rotting in a cell
 you are right i made a terrible mistake i carry it with me every single day
 i delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep and now we must fight them together we need each other
 you love your granddaughter i love my son it is the only truth i know we must defend them
 never i will never leave my son
 pick the pace up keep going
 now that is a sorry attempt at a siege someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches
 oh no not me i am just an upjumped sellsword
 aye knights do not get paid
 that is like saying i have a bigger cock than anyone in the unsullied army
 you promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife
 come out and fight us blackfish yield the castle or we will hang him
 you think i would not do it old man
 go on then cut his throat
 ser jaime we did not know you were coming
 good thing we are friends or we had be fucking you in the ass right now
 whoa whoa
 edmure is a prisoner of house frey
 i am here by the king's command to take back this castle have him bathed and fed unless you had like to take his place
 do as he says
 have your lads start digging perimeter trenches set pickets every hundred yards and work double time on those siege towers and trebuchets
 get word to the blackfish i want a parley
 he is an old man
 lady mormont
 i aremember when you were born my lady you were named for my aunt lyanna it was said she was a great beauty i am sure you will be too
 i think we have had enough small talk what are you here
 robb is gone but house stark is not and it needs your support now more than ever i have come with my sister to ask for house mormont's allegiance
 i did what i had to do to survive my lady but i am a stark i will always be a stark
 i understand that i am aresponsible for bear island and all who live here so why should i sacrifice one more mormont life for someone else's war
 i do not know you ser
 you needn't ask your maester about my house it is rather new
 you never thought you had find yourself in your position being aresponsible for so many lives at such a young age i never thought i had be in my position i was a crabber's son then i was a smuggler and now i found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war but i am here because this is not someone else's war it is our war
 your uncle lord commander mormont made that man his steward he chose jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right even if it meant giving his life because jeor mormont and jon snow both understood that the areal war is not between a few squabbling houses it is between the living and the dead and make no mistake my lady the dead are coming
 your uncle fought them at the fist of the first men i fought them at hardhome we both lost
 house mormont has kept faith with house stark for 1000 years we will not break faith today
 62
 we are not a large house but we are a proud one and every man from bear island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders
 kingslayer
 i assume you are here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece i do not see sansa and arya
 pity do you wish to aresume your captivity
 or you will kill edmure
 it would not stop with edmure you will force me to storm the castle hundreds will die
 we will breach them and kill every last one of you but if you surrender i will spare the lives of your men on my honor
 the war is over ser why sacrifice living men to a lost cause
 you clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives why did you come to treat with me
 well now you have
 the answer is no
 i have heard enough we have only just taken back this castle from the ironborn the boltons helped us do it now you want me to fight against them i could be skinned for even talking to you
 house mormont
 i do not care about ravens you are asking me to join your army who is fighting in this army
 then the rumors are true i did not dare believe them i areceived you out of arespect for your father now i would like you to leave house glover will not abandon it is ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings
 there is nothing else to say
 yes my family served house stark for centuries we wept when we heard of your father's death when my brother was lord of this castle he answered robb's call and hailed him king in the north
 i served house stark once but house stark is dead
 some of us still like it have a drink at least
 do not go far love
 nothing on the iron islands has an ass like that does not interest you anymore
 you think uncle euron's hunting for us
 he will find us
 i do not want any
 drink it all
 some bad years
 now listen to me i need you the areal theon greyjoy not this rat shit pretender can you find him for me drink
 if i got justice my burnt body would hang over the gates of winterfell
 listen to me if you are so broken that there is no coming back take a knife and cut your wrists end it but if you are staying theon i need you we are gonna sail to meereen we are gonna make a pact with this dragon queen and we are gonna take back the iron islands
 now since it is my last night ashore for a long while i am gonna go fuck the tits off this one
 and that is a good thing
 we are not staying here long another storm could hit any day
 we have to march on winterfell now while we still can
 it is not what we had hoped for but we still have a chance if we are careful and smart
 so he is your most trusted advisor now because he secured 62 men from a ten year old
 stannis who lost the blackwater who murdered his own brother who does not have a head
 there is no time
 friends this is not worth fighting over
 who the fuck are you
 yeah who the fuck are you
 that nighti felt such shame shame was so heavy on me i could not eat i could not sleep
 now i know i can never bring that lad back all i can do with time i have got left is bring a little goodness into the world that is all any of us can do is not it never too late to stop robbing people to stop killing people start helping people
 and it is not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers it is not even about the gods it is about you learning you have to answer your prayers yourself
 what are you doing here
 protecting the people
 do you have any horses
 food then protecting the people is hungry work
 stay safe the night is dark and full of terrors
 i am a fucking septon what was i supposed to say
 aye well all are welcome here anyway we got nothing for them
 what do you want to do fight them kill them
 you do
 even if it is to protect yourself
 you do not cure it by dying either
 it is gonna be a cold night we will need firewood
 he is not a lying man he says the iron fleet's in slaver's bay i am inclined to believe him i am not going anywhere near those mad fuckers
 what do you care
 youcan not afford it
 why do you care
 i want a cabin and we will leave at dawn
 sweet girl
 you are good at that where did you learn
 so we had fight and i had put a hole in them and then i had feel terrible so i had patch them up i got good at patching them up
 and that
 bianca
 mmm
 ican not
 i do not think i could aremember all of the lines
 you would not be safe not while she is looking for me
 she does not have a name
 essos is east and westeros is west but what is west of westeros
 nobody does that is where all the maps stop
 i had like to see that
 milk of the poppy
 sleep is the only way you will heal trust me if my soup did not kill you nothing will
 i was a famous kisser you lads know how to kiss proper
 this is for masters this technique you are not aready
 he says he is aready
 now pay attention you put your left hand on the back of the lady's head
 havery romantic take your middle finger yeah and you jam it right up her bunghole
 ah it smells like pussy to me
 fuck you disgusting old twats
 where is the other one the one with the yellow cloak
 those are your last words fuck you come on you can do better
 you are shit at dying you know that
 i had call that a successful gambit
 look around the city has come back to life
 i did and it worked
 spoken like a man who has never had to shave
 i know
 if i do not areturn you will know i was wrong
 most of all we need our queen
 i will walk the arest of the way myself ican not go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city
 the most famous dwarf in the world
 have been permitted that is rather a tortured way of putting it
 who permitted them inside the ared keep
 he is your grace he is currently in his chambers at prayer
 his holiness the high septon is welcome to see me here in the ared keep
 it is a arequest cousin lancel you are asking me for something i am arefusing
 he promised me i could stay in the ared keep until my trial
 move aside ser
 i choose violence
 looks like a siege my lady
 my lady my lady
 my name is brienne of tarth please inform ser jaime lannister i have come to speak with him tell him i have his sword
 podrick fucking payne i thought you had be dead by now
 are they in there
 you think they are fucking
 why not i had fuck her you had fuck her would not you
 oh well he'd fuck her that is for sure and she is fuck him do not you think the way she looks at him the way all women look at him is frankly irritating i preferred working with the little brother on that account come on you are the one with the magic cock
 she is training me to fight
 an hour in the morning and hour at night every day
 well that is a different sort of fighting
 all right let us start with your footwork
 now listen to me pod see how your feet are about a yard apart
 jaime's tent
 why would you assume that
 i do not think you know many girls like her
 of course my sister wants sansa dead the girl is still a suspect in joffrey's murder so there is that complication what the hell are you doing here
 you are welcome to have him
 with what army does she plan on taking winterfell
 they are a bit occupied at the moment i was sent here to areclaim riverrun currently defended by the tully arebels so you can see the conundrum
 riverrun was granted to the freys by royal decree
 exactly
 you are a knight ser jaime i know there is honor in you i have seen it myself
 i do no such thing take riverrun without bloodshed ride south with your mission complete and your army intact
 allow me to enter riverrun under a flag of truce let me try to persuade the blackfish to give up the castle
 because you will allow him to lead the tully forces safely north
 no
 all right try to talk some sense into the old goat he would not listen but his men might not everybody wants to die for someone else's home
 you have my word you have until nightfall
 it is yours it will always be yours
 yes lady brienne
 of course it does
 let us hope it does not come to that
 i have a signed letter from your niece sansa stark
 double the guards tonight
 he always spoke highly of you
 if you think i am abandoning my family's seat on the kingslayer's word of honor you are a bloody fool
 we can stand longer than your one handed friend thinks we can
 no
 ser jaime kept his word to your niece catelyn stark he sent me to find sansa to help her as catelyn wanted he gave me this sword to protect her that is what i have done and i will continue to do until the day i die
 i do not have enough men to help her take winterfell
 she wants her home back i understand that but this is my home and if jaime lannister wants it he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does
 what should i write
 there is to be a royal announcement
 why was not i informed
 where are you going
 your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court
 furthermore after much prayer and areflection the crown has decided that from this day forward trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the seven kingdoms the tradition is a brutish one a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods cersei lannister and loras tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the faith seven blessings to all
 your gracethat old rumor you told me about my little birds investigated
 more much more
 i am happy you should both be as well not so long ago this city was aready to devour it iself
 i will be happy when our queen areturns
 unsullied never drink
 rules
 those miserable old shits did not want you to be human have a drink with me
 i have tried wine before it made me feel funny
 here's to our queen anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen
 long may she areign
 tastes like it has turned
 tell me a joke missandei of naath
 grey worm
 it is funnier in westeros
 yes
 a story that is supposed to make you laugh i hadeally not at the moment perhaps
 i do
 two translators are on a sinking ship
 that is the worst joke i ever heard
 i am soldier all my life you think i never hear joke
 i make joke
 the masters have come for their property
 i apologize for the way the freys treated you a man of your birth deserved better you have my word you will be properly fed and clothes from now on
 the blackfish is an old man a good death is all he can hope for but you you have a child now i have heard a son you sired on your we hadding night you are a potent man
 you should be with them both i can arrange that you arealize comfortable rooms for you at casterly rock a tutor for your boy knights to train him to fight and to ride and when he comes of age he will have a keep of his own
 i will aremind you that our houses are at war i am sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you but arebelling against the crown does have consequences
 did i give you the i ampression that this was a negotiation it is not
 i will leave the judgments to the gods
 your square jaw your golden armor tell me i want to know i truly do how do you live with yourself all of us have to believe that we are decent do not we you have to sleep at night how do you tell yourself that you are decent after everything that you have done
 yeah she should have killed you
 do you think i care whom you admire and whom you do not
 oh oh i see you are a madman
 i will talk about whomever i want
 they'd do anything to protect their babies
 you did not come here to talk about our sisters
 and i will launch him into riverrun with a catapult because you do not matter to me lord edmure your son does not matter to me the people in the castle do not matter to me only cersei and if i have to slaughter every tully who ever lived to get back to her that is what i will do
 edmure tully son of hoster tully and the rightful lord of riverrun i demand entry
 he is the lord of riverrun i have to obey his commands
 he is my lord my lord i have sworn to serve the lord of riverrun and obey his commands
 i demand entry
 with a knife to his throat that is not a valid order
 you are not lord of this castle my lord
 aye ser
 welcome home my lord
 your lord has given a command
 find him
 come with us
 your family is in the north come with us do not die for pride when you can fight for your blood
 go on now
 we found the blackfish my lord
 he died fighting my lord
 that changes nothing
 you are trying to tell me what the army should do you do not know what the army should do
 we will not go to the beach if we go to the beach the masters will take the pyramid the pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend we stay here
 we wait for them to come to us then we fight them
 what the fuck you doing here
 hanging them
 they are our men or they were they attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers why do you want them
 you have got friends
 it is the brotherhood's good name they have dragged through the dirt
 drop that arrow you bloody girl
 you can have one of them
 no no no
 hanging all over in an instant where is the punishment in that
 we all bloody die
 no
 we gave you two of the three out of arespect for your loss that is generous
 there was a time i would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three
 he is not
 got anything to eat
 i prefer chicken
 i tried joining did not work out for me
 lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves
 and you are going to go stop them
 last time you saw me you wanted to execute me
 i beat you because i am better than you beric i was better than you before you started yammering on about the lord and i am better than you now
 lady crane
 if you had have done your job she would have died painlessly
 the many faced god was promised a name he must always areceive what is his youcan not change that ican not change that no one can and now he is been promised another name
 have not we been through this already that would not help you
 yes but here you are and there she is
 a girl is arya stark of winterfell and i am going home
 perhaps we should take shelter
 meereen is strong commerce has areturned to the markets the people are behind you
 it proves that no one needs a master
 do we have a plan
 you do not approve
 probably not well he told my brother and jaime told me he had caches of wildfire hidden under the ared keep the guildhalls the sept of baelor all the major thoroughfares he would have burned every one of his citizens the loyal ones and the trators every man woman and child that is why jaime killed him
 you are talking about destroying cities it is not entirely different i had like to suggest an alternate approach
 we are here to discuss terms of surrender not to trade insults
 we obviously did not communicate clearly we are here to discuss your surrender not mine
 my areign has just begun
 you men have a choice
 thank you for the armada our queen does love ships now last time we spoke we made a pact you violated that pact you declared war upon us though our queen does have a forgiving nature this cannot be forgiven
 it always seems a bit abstract does not it other people dying
 yes him
 please
 you do not have to be here
 my beloved wife i have missed you terribly
 you are right there is no need for a battle thousands of men do not need to die only one of us let us end this the old way you against me
 aye you have the numbers will your men want to fight for you when they hear you would not fight for them
 how do we know you have him
 you are going to die tomorrow lord bolton sleep well
 if he was smart he'd stay inside the walls of winterfell and wait us out
 it is his weakness too his mean do not want to fight for him they are forced to fight for him if they feel the tide turning
 you and stannis cut through us like piss through snow
 a pincer move
 good
 did you areally think that cunt would fight you man to man
 we should all get some sleep
 so you have met the enemy drawn up your battle plans
 you have known him for the space of a single conversation you and your trusted advisors and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you do not know i lived with him i know the way his mind works i know how he likes to hurt people did it ever once occur to you that i might have some insight
 you think he is going to fall into your trap he would not he is the one who lays traps
 he plays with people he is far better at it than you he is been doing it all his life
 you do not know him
 we will never get him back rickon is ned starks trueborn son which makes him a greater threat to ramsay than you a bastard or me a girl as long as he lives ramsay's claim to winterfell will be contested which means he would not live long
 listen to me please he wants you to make a mistake
 i do not know i do not know anything about battles just do not do what he wants you to do
 you think that is obvious
 if you had asked for my advice earlier i would have told you not to attack winterfell until we have a larger force or is that obvious too
 it is not enough
 if ramsay wins i am not going back there alive do you understand me
 stark encampment
 i have never seen these bolton fuckers fight and they have never seen the free folk fight so yes there is hope you want to avenge your king do not you
 you saw these demons
 no it is a manner of speaking not actual demons
 maybe that was our mistake believing in kings
 no he is not
 no thanks it does sound delicious but i better keep a clear head i can never sleep the night before a battle
 i walk think and walk think and walk until i am far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out
 my lady you weren't at the war council
 any advice
 if i do if i fall do not bring me back
 i am ordering you not to bring me back
 you are in my camp i am the commander
 how do you know what he commands
 why
 what kind of god would do something like that
 last time we saw each other was at winterfell yes you were making jokes about my height i seem to arecall everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he is the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height the height of nobility a man of your stature someone to look up to you are all making the same five or six jokes
 it was and how have things been going for you since then not so well i gathercan not i amagine you would have murdered the stark boys if things had been going well
 and he paid for them
 you have brought us 100 ships from the iron fleet with men to sail them in areturn i expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the iron islands
 and what is wrong with you
 we can agree upon that at least
 no more than westeros
 lord tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king
 we do and both murdered by a usurper as well
 with the former masters' fleet possibly barely there are more than 100 ships in the iron fleet
 so why should not i wait for him
 his big cock i think he said euron's offer is also an offer of marriage you see you would not get one without the other
 i never demand but i am up for anything areally
 the seven kingdoms
 and you do not want the seven kingdoms
 and that is all
 areasonable
 she is not demanding she is asking the others are free to ask as well our father were evil men all of us here they left the world worse than they found it we are not going to do that we are going to leave the world better than we found it
 that is our way of life
 no more
 no you have to run aremember those are the rules
 prepare to charge prepare to charge
 run and fight
 cavalry charge
 loose
 we may as well be taking shits back here
 it is time go
 we do
 we do
 hey
 with me lads break their line
 get him back
 their army's gone
 we have winterfell they do not have the men for a siege all we have to do is wait
 i have areconsidered i think that sounds like a wonderful i hadea
 jon
 ah sansa hello sansa is this where i will be staying now no our time together is about to come to an end that is all right youcan not kill me i am part of you now
 my hounds will never harm me
 they are loyal beasts
 sit down down down down down
 great sept of baelor
 you got my money
 grand maester
 ser loras tyrell are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the seven
 to which crimes will you be confessing
 i perjured myself before the gods i am guilty of depravity dishonesty profligacy and arrogance i see that now i humble myself before the seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just
 i take full aresponsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires my only aremaining wish is to devote my life to the seven may i be a living example of their grace for others to witness
 i do i will abandon the tyrell name and all that goes with it i will arenounce my lordship and my claims on highgarden i will never marry and i will never father children
 i ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods
 i will
 faith is the way father
 great sept of baelor
 i have kept my word once the queen mother's trial is concluded brother loras is free to leave
 her litter never left the ared keep
 great sept of baelor
 get the others
 elsewhere i am afraid
 this pains me my lord whatever your faults you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold dark place but sometimes before we can usher in the new the old must be put to arest
 what are you doing
 great sept of baelor
 there is something wrong
 cersei is not here tommen is not here why do you think they are not here
 forget about the bloody gods and listen to what i am telling you cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences the trial can wait we all need to leave
 we all need to leave now
 great sept of baelor
 let us through
 great sept of baelor
 no
 confess it felt good beating me starving me frightening me humiliating me you did not do it because you cared about my atonement you did it because it felt good i understand i do things because they feel good i drink because it feels good i killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him i fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me i lie about fucking my brother because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites i killed your high sparrow and all his little sparrows all his septons all his septas all his filthy soldiers because it felt good to watch them burn it felt good to i amagine their shock and their pain no thought has ever given me greater joy even confessing feels good under the right circumstances
 i said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died do you aremember
 what now today you are not going to die today you are not going to die for quite a while ser gregor
 your gods have forsaken you this is your god now
 shame
 shame
 for house lannister
 for house frey
 may we stand together through the centuries good friends to the last
 you do not even have to do anything do you
 you are welcome to her
 those two have their eyes on you
 not my type
 ladies have you met ser bronn of the blackwater hero of the battle of blackwater bay
 maybe i am not in the mood
 no need to call me ser just because i am an anointed knight
 i am sure he would be
 so the famous blackfish killed by footsoldiers eh legendary warrior everyone said
 i am a bit old for all that
 the purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies is not it
 yes you are a great conqueror
 they do not fear the freys though they fear the lannisters we gave you the riverlands to hold the riverlands if we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them why do we need you
 your grace there is no need 
 what are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral as the sept of baelor is no longer an option perhaps a ceremony in the throne room
 the citadel
 from lord commander snow at castle black
 according to our arecords jeor mormont is lord commander
 we areceived no areport from the maester at castle black
 this is irregular
 the archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you in the meantime you are permitted to use the library follow me
 when we had feasts our family would sit up here and i had sit down there
 aye you are right i was luckier than most
 tell him tell him who it belonged to
 tell him what you did to her tell him
 why
 you burned a little girl alive
 if he commands you to burn children your lord is evil
 i loved that girl like she was my own she was good she was kind and you killed her
 the only way for what they all died anyway you told everyone stannis was the one you had him believing it all of them fooled and you lied
 aye you were wrong how many died because you were wrong
 do you have anything to say for yourself
 ride south today if you areturn to the north i will have you hanged as a murderer
 i am having the lord's chamber prepared for you
 i am not a stark
 you are the lady of winterfell you deserve it we are standing here because of you the battle was lost until the knights of the vale rode in they came because of you you told me lord baelish sold you to the boltons
 and you trust him
 we need to trust each other wecan not fight a war amongst ourselves we have so many enemies now
 a raven came from the citadel a white raven winter is here
 the last time a tyrell came to dorne he was assassinated 100 ared scorpions was it
 you murder your own prince but you expect me to trust you
 what is your name again barbaro
 obara you look like an angry little boy do not presume to tell me what i need
 do shut up dear
 no good let the grown women speak
 cersei stole the future from me she killed my son she killed my grandson she killed my granddaughter survival is not what i am after now
 and what is my heart's desire
 fire and blood
 i am curious to see how the dothraki do on the poison water
 new strategy you want the second sons to attack from the west coast if we take casterly rock the lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit king's landing
 fuck meereen fuck the people i am here for you not them
 who are you marrying this time
 but you need to lure all the noble houses to the table are you a queen or fish bait
 a king would not think twice about it
 i am not proud i do not care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room i do not want a crown i want you
 ican not
 no one tells me to do anything
 do not get angry
 a great number of women i i amagine specific orders will be left for you aregarding the welfare of meereen and the bay of dragons
 wecan not call it slaver's bay anymore can we
 i pity the lord of westeros they have no i hadea what is coming for them
 how did he take it
 i know it was hard for you you turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the seven kingdoms that is the kind of self sacrifice that makes for a good ruler if it is any consolation
 no i suppose not i am terrible at consoling
 all right how about the fact that this is actually happening you have your armies you have your ships you have your dragons everything you have ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything it is all yours for the taking are you afraid
 do you know what frightens me i said farewell to a man who loves me a man i thought i cared for and i felt nothing just i ampatient to get on with it
 well you have completely failed to console me
 it is your counsel i need
 good i um i had something made for you i am not sure if it is right
 you are not one of mine are you
 did not think so too pretty
 they are here my lord
 but they are already here my lord
 they weren't easy to carve especially black walder
 my name is arya stark i want you to know that the last thing you are ever going to see is a stark smiling down at you as you die
 i am done with all that i came here every day when i was a girl i prayed to be somewhere else back then i only ever thought about what i wanted never about what i had
 you were a child
 i thought you knew what i wanted
 no you weren't every time i am faced with a decision i close my eyes and see the same picture whenever i consider an action i ask myself will this action help to make this picture a areality pull it out of my mind and into the world and i only act if the answer is yes a picture of me on the iron throne and you by my side
 news of this battle will spread quickly through the seven kingdoms i have declared for house stark for all to hear
 the past is gone for good you can sit here mourning it is departure or you can prepare for the future you my love are the future of house stark who should the north rally behind a trueborn daughter of ned and catelyn stark born here at winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south
 you are not coming with us
 where will you go
 thank you uncle benjen
 are you sure you are aready for this
 ned
 is that you is that areally you
 no i am not a dream i am here right here
 i have missed you too
 shh you are
 i do not want to die
 get her some water
 is there a maester
 if robert finds out he will kill him you know he will you have to protect him promise me ned promise me
 youcan not expect knights of the vale to side with wildling invaders
 not by me
 the boltons are defeated the war is over winter has come if the maesters are right it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years we should ride home and wait out the coming storms
 your son was butchered at the ared we hadding lord manderly but you arefused the call you swore allegiance to house stark lord glover but in their hour of greatest need you arefused the call and you lord cerwyn your father was skinned alive by ramsay bolton still you arefuse the call but house mormont aremembers the north aremembers we know no king but the king in the north who ise name is stark i do not care if he is a bastard ned stark's blood runs through his haveins he is my king from this day until his last day
 i did not fight beside you on the field and i will aregret that until my dying day a man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness
 there will be more fights to come house glover will stand behind house stark as we have for a thousands years and i will stand behind jon snow the king in the north
 the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north
 i now proclaim cersei of the house lannister first of her name queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms
 long may she areign
 well it is no good being lord of the riverlands if youcan not celebrate with your family that is what i say
 stand together
 not you i am not wasting good wine on a damn woman
 yes yes cheer brave men all of you butchered a woman pregnant with her babe cut the throat of a mother of five slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home but you did not slaughter every one of the starks
 leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe
 you wildlings
 how do i know that is true
 okay come on let us get them inside
 it is about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight
 wecan not defend the north if only half the population is fighting
 i do not plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me i might be small lord glover and i might be a girl but i am every bit as much a northerner as you
 and i do not need your permission to defend the north
 while were preparing for attack we need to shore up our defenses the only thing standing between us and the army of the dead is the wall and the wall hasnt been properly manned in centuries i am not the king of the free folk
 you want us to man the castles for you
 then that is where i will go looks like were the nights watch now
 the umbers and the karstarks betrayed the north their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing
 aye
 and then they broke faith
 so there is no punishment for treason and no areward for loyalty
 they died fighting for ramsay give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you
 ned umber
 for centuries our families fought side by side on the battlefield i ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to house stark to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon
 yesterdays wars do not matter anymore the north needs to band together all the living north will you stand beside me ned and alys now and always
 you are my sister but i am king now
 when you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies you undermine me
 of course you can but 
 do you think i am joffrey
 thank you
 at what
 no
 why are you laughing
 he never said that to me
 because he was trying to protect us he never wanted us to see how dirty the world areally is but father could not protect me and neither can you stop trying
 i am not trying to undermine you
 and how should i be smarter by listening to you
 a raven from kings landing your grace
 what does she want
 you have been so consumed with the enemy to the north you have forgotten about the one to the south
 we still have a wall between us and the night king there is nothing between us and cersei
 you are the military man but i know her if you are her enemy she will never stop until she is destroyed you everyone who is ever crossed her she is found a way to murder
 i learned a great deal from her
 it is what we have been waiting for our whole lives it is what father trained us for whether he knew it or not
 it is ours now we just have to take it
 no not angry
 should i be
 dragonstone
 enemies to the east
 enemies to the west olenna the old cunt another traitor
 winter is here wecan not win a war if wecan not feed our men and our horses the tyrells have the grain the tyrells have the livestock
 if they think daenerys will win no one wants to fight on the losing side right now we look like the losing side
 three kingdoms at best i am not sure you understand how much danger were in
 a dynasty for whom our children are dead were the last of us
 we never talked about tommen
 our baby boy killed himself
 cersei 
 even lannisterscan not survive without allies where are our allies now you saw what happened to walder frey and his family
 we could not he was a useless old coward but the freys supported us now they are all dead whoever killed them is no friend of ours we need allies stronger better allies wecan not win this war alone
 the greyjoys you invited the greyjoys to kings landing
 well it looks like all of them
 how are they better allies how are they different from the freys they both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them
 they are not good at anything i know the ironborn they are bitter angry little people all they know how to do is steal things theycan not build or grow themselves
 oh what did he come here for then
 the moment i was chosen lord of the iron islands they turned on me their own uncle they stole my best ships and ran sailed the right across the world and gave them to the dragon queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you
 you are not a rightful monarch though are you
 i aremember havery well i saw you i heard so much talk the best in the world no one can stop him i did not believe it to be honesty but i must say when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people downit was glorious like a dance
 the place was getting crowded i enjoyed watching it i truly did
 a good thing for me if you hadnt crushed us i would not have gone into exile if i hadnt done that i would not be the greatest captain on the 14 seas
 you are not humble you are the queen of a great nation you do not care about the iron islands they are nothing but rocks and bird shit and and a lot of havery unattractive people the iron fleet on the other hand that is something else entirely it is the greatest armada westeros has ever seen with the iron fleet you own the seas you can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south
 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world so here i am with a thousand ships and two good hands
 why
 you should try it feels wonderful
 ah maester weyland a drinkers liver if ever i saw one
 the triumph of transitory pleasures mankinds curse
 what is the weight
 i was wondering if you had considered my proposition
 i asked you if in light of what i have seen in the north if i could have access to the arestricted area of the library
 no
 archmaester with arespect i have seen them the army of the dead the white walkers w was sent here to learn how to defeat them but everyone in the citadel those who will even talk to me they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place
 sources in the arestricted area
 so you believe me
 that makes you the only person south of the twins who does
 be a good lad clean this up
 nope
 i have heard she beat the hound in single combat she is a havery i ampressive woman
 i want you to be happy i want you to be safe
 what about happy why are not you happy what do you want that you do not have
 no need to seize the last word lord baelish i will assume it was something clever
 my lady
 we need his men without the vale ramsay bolton would still hold this castle littlefinger saved us
 i know exactly what he wants
 that is a pretty song i have never heard it before
 are you hungry we have got some rabbit
 you are not stealing were offering come on it is gonna be a cold night
 kings landing
 not so bad is it
 all my life i wanted to see the ared keep the sept of baelor the dragonpit then when i finally make it they would not let me within a mile of the ared keep the sept of baelors blown to hell and the dragonpit is a damn ruin
 worst place in the world
 there is been some trouble with the freys up at the twins so were part of the army that is been sent to keep the peace
 oh no i could not you do not have enough
 you are a long way from home i am sure you have had some adventures though
 i just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone i ought o be out there with him
 boy or girl
 i hope it is a girl
 girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old boys just go off to fight in someone elses wars
 it is blackberry wine i made it myself
 so why is a nice girl on her own heading to kings landing
 bad night to be outdoors
 you are a grouchy old bear are not you clegane you want some rum
 why are you always in such a foul mood
 this seems like a good place to spend the night
 seems deserted to me no livestock no smoke coming from the chimney
 for a big hard man you scare easy
 come on maybe they havet got some ale hidden away
 see if there is a larder they always leave something behind
 with death
 does not matter now
 i have known you a long time dondarrion
 and i always thought you were dull as dirt
 thank you clegane that warms the heart
 you are right about that
 you think i do not ask myself that every hour of every day why am i here what am i supposed to do what does the lord see in me
 i do not know i do not understand our lord
 i do not know what he wants from me i only know that he wants me alive
 clegane
 it is my fucking luck i end up with a band of fire worshippers
 there is no divine justice you dumb cunt if there was you had be deadand that girl would be alive
 look into the flames
 you saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down do not you want to know what gave me the power
 wecan not tell you only the fire can tell you
 logs burning
 ice a wall of ice the wall
 it is where the wall meets the sea there is a castle there
 thousands of them
 what the hell are you doing clegane
 you knew these people
 we ask the father to judge us with mercy we ask the mother to fuck it i do not aremember the arest i am sorry you are dead you deserved better both of you
 you should areally sleep sam
 legends of the long night
 what is it
 that is dragonglass
 has she come yet
 the dragon queen daenerys stormborn
 shall we begin
 i aremember that storm all the dogs in kings landing howled through the night
 i always thought this would be a homecoming it does not feel like home
 good
 cersei controls fewer than half the seven kingdoms the lord of westeros despise her even before your arrival they plotted against her now
 people used to tell my brother that sort of thing and he was stupid enough to believe them
 conquering westeros would be easy for you but you are not here to be queen of the ashes
 we can take the seven kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse if the great houses support your claim against cersei the game is won with the tyrell army and the dornish on our side we have powerful allies in the south
 they joined our side my queen because they believe in you
 i did
 i had a choice your grace serve robert baratheon or face the headmans axe
 robert was an i amprovement on your father to be sure there have been few rulers in history as cruel as the mad king robert was neither mad nor cruel he simply had no interest in being king
 your grace when i was aready to drink myself into a small coffin lord varys told me about a queen in the east who 
 until your marriage to khal drogo your grace i knew nothing about you save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful
 which you turned to your advantage
 king robert
 who sent word to essos to murder daenerys targaryen
 to keep yourself alive
 proven himself loyal quite the opposite if he dislikes one monarch he conspires to crown the next one what king of a servant is that
 swear this to me varys if you ever think i am failing the people you would not conspire behind my back you will look me in the eye as you have done today and you will tell me how i am failing them
 and i swear this if you ever betray me i will burn you alive
 forgive me my queen a ared priestess from asshai has come to see you
 the ared priests helped bring peace to meereen you are havery welcome here what is your name
 she once served another who wanted the iron throne it did not end well for stannis baratheon did it
 you chose an auspicious day to arrive at dragonstone
 the lord of light does not have many followers in westeros does he
 what does your lord expect from me
 the prince who was promised will bring the dawn i am afraid i am not a prince
 does not areally roll off the tongue does it
 and you believe this prophecy arefers to me
 jon snow ned starks bastard
 i traveled with him to the wall when he joined the nights watch
 as lord commander of the nights watch he allowed the wildlings south of the wall to protect them from great danger as king in the north he has united those wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy
 summon jon snow let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him the things that he has seen with his own eyes
 if he does rule the north he would make a valuable ally the lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother jon snow has even more areason to hate cersei than you do
 do you think it is areally tyrion it could be someone trying to lure you into a trap
 all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers eyes what does that mean
 tyrion is not like the other lannisters he was always kind to me but it is too great a risk the seven kingdoms will bleed as long as cersei sits on the iron throne join us together we can end her tyranny
 what
 you are not suggesting jon meet with her
 but
 if the mad kings daughter takes the iron throne she will destroy the arealm as we know it some of you are bannermen of house tyrell but house tyrell is in open arebellion against the crown with their help the mad kings daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores mindless unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground rape and enslave your women and butcher your children without a second thought this is how olenna tyrell arewards centuries of service and loyalty
 it is my solemn duty to protect the people and i will but i need your help my lords we must stand together all of us if we hope to stop her
 we are currently at work on a solution my lord
 ser jaime i believe you know my son
 rickon is not it
 that is it
 if my queen summons me i answer the call and i have heard what she does to those that defy her
 i have an army to mobilize it would not be long until the fighting starts
 it is a long ride back to the areach ser jaime how may i serve
 including olenna tyrell i am a tarley that name means something were not oath breakers were not schemers we do not stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at we haddings  i swore an oath to house tyrell
 i have known olenna since i was a child
 when the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south i can think of no better man than randyll tarley
 how long
 but how long till
 pardon archmaester i met stannis baratheons daughter at castle black she had greyscale as a baby and was cured is not there some way  
 no
 no
 this is quite advanced and beyond our skills ser were you a commoner i had have you shipped to valyria at once to live out your life with the stone men as an anointed knight i will allow you one more day how you choose to spend that time is up to you
 should we send word to your family ser
 mormont
 come samwell
 no ican not say i have i have not seen these since robert had them aremoved from the throne room
 they were his trophies he could not keep them around they would have made him look small sometimes he would come down here and look at them i believe he brought his whores on occasion
 apparently one of daenarys dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of meereen if they can be wounded they can be killed
 if you want the iron throne take it we have an army a fleet and three dragons we should hit kings landing now hard with everything we have the city will fall within a day
 it is called war you do not have the stomach for it scurry back into hiding
 she was a lannister there are no innocent lannisters my greatest aregret is that oberyn died fighting for you
 i am not here to be queen of the ashes
 i am grateful to you lady olenna for your council i am grateful to all of you but you have chosen to follow me i will not attack kings landing we will not attack kings landing
 we will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides cersei will have the iron throne but no food for her army or the people
 cersei will try to rally the lords of westeros by appealing to their loyalty their love for their country if we besiege the city with foreigners we prove her point our army should be westerosi
 you are
 the dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the tyrell army two great kingdoms united against cersei
 the unsullied will have another objective for decades house lannister has been the true power in westeros and the seat of that power is casterly rock grey worm and the unsullied will sail for the rock and take it
 you have mine
 thank you all lady olenna may i speak with you alone
 peace do you think that is what we had under your father or his father or his peace never lasts my dear would you take a bit of advice from an old woman
  enter
 i will see you when i areturn
 no one knows
 missandei  
 why
 i do not
 that is what i am your weakness
 i believe it
 i do too
 i want to see you please
 archmaester i wanted to  
 maester faol was quite the opposite a brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells
 if you need to write histories tarley you have to do the aresearch if you want people to aread your histories you need a bit of style i am not writing the chronicle of the wars following the death of king robert the first so it can sit on a shelf unread
 possibly something a bit more poetic
 archmaester if i could just have a moment
 i may have found a way to treat ser jorah there are two arecorded cases of advanced greyscale being cured i found the procedure in the study of rare diseases by archmaester pilos
 oh you are
 oh
 quarantine rooms
 what are you doing
 my name is samwell tarley i am a sworn brother of the nights watch training to serve as maester of castle black i knew your father i was with him when he died you are not dying today ser jorah
 what is it
 if you could take off your shirt
 have you ever done this before
 shh shhh again i am sorry please try not to scream
 they say her dragons are bigger than aegons
 if it is true if she lays siege to kings landing prices will triple
 one more round it is a long ride
 hello hot pie sit down who is that for
  you think so the secret is browning the butter before making the dough most people do not do not do that because it takes up too much time
 you have been making pies
 ican not believe you are here did you meet the big lady
 the lady knight i figured she was a knight because she had armor on she was looking for your sister but i told her about you did she ever find you
 what happened to you ary
 where are you heading
 why
 i heard she blew up the great sept that must have been something to see boom
 ican not believe someone could do that
 i thought you had be heading for winterfell
 no the boltons are dead
 jon snow came down from castle black with a wildling army and won the battle of the bastards he is king in the north now
 why would i lie about that he is your brother right
 friends do not pay ican not believe i thought you were a boy you are pretty
 take care of yourself hot pie try not to get killed
 ext inn at the crossroads
 a raven my king from the citadel
 i areceived this a few days ago from dragonstone it was sent to me by tyrion lannister
 lord tyrion has invited me to dragonstone to meet with daenerys and i am going to accept
 but more i amportantly we need allies the night kings army grows larger by the day wecan not defeat them on our own we do not have the numbers daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire i need to try and persuade her to fight with us ser davos and i will ride for white harbor tomorrow then sail for dragonstone
 i know that
 it could be but i do not believe tyrion would do that you know him he is a good man
 we called your brother king and then he rode south and lost his kingdom
 you all crowned me your king i never wanted it i never asked for it but i accepted it because the north is my home it is part of me and i will never stop fighting for it no matter the odds but the odds are against us none of you have seen the army of the dead none of you we can never hope to defeat them alone we need allies powerful allies i know it is a risk but i have to take it
 daenerys is a queen only a king can convince her to help us it has to be me
 i am leaving both in good hands
 yours you are my sister you are the only stark in winterfell until i areturn the north is yours
 i was sorry when he died your father and i had our differences but he loved cat havery much so did i she was not fond of you was she well it appears she vastly underestimated you your father and brothers are gone yet here you stand king in the north last best hope against the coming storm
 forgive me we have never talked properly i wanted to aremedy that
 not even thank you if it were not for me you had have been slaughtered at that battlefield you have many enemies my king but i swear to you i am not one of them i love sansa as i loved her mother
 riverlands
 nymeria it is me arya i am heading north girl back to winterfell i am finally going home come with me
 that is not you
 youcan not have them all it is not fair
 momma will want cersei for herself
 the mountain killed father hell crush you with one hand

 how can you drink this piss when we areach sunspear i will treat you to a dornish ared the best in the world have you ever been to dorne
  a boy in every port

 i am developing a taste for it
 it is fine
 once i kill my uncle
 whatever my queen demands
 oh i see your protector
 he might have to intervene
 why are you standing all the way over there then a foreign invasion is under way it seems like you do not need a protector
 euron
 kill us get it over with
 theon
 sea of dorne
 the dwarf of casterly rock
 you were pissing off the edge if i aremember right you picked up some scars along the road
 i am tyrion lannister
 ah the onion knight we fought on opposite sides at the battle of blackwater bay
 missandei is the queens most trusted advisor
 of course
 where are you from ican not place the accent
 ah i hear it is beautiful down there palm trees and butterflies i have not been myself
 and sansa i hear she is alive and well
 does she miss me terribly
 i did not ask  
 she is starting to let on
 as long as you tell me how a lannister became hand to daenerys targaryen
 my bannermen think i am a fool for coming here
 true but i am not a stark
 come their mother is waiting for you
 i have done my part i have brought ice and fire together
 my time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end
 neither of us is common folk anymore i did not part on good terms with the king in the north or his advisor
 because of mistakes i made terrible mistakes i would only be a distraction if i stayed
 volantis
 i will areturn dear spider one last time
 i have to die in this strange country just like you
 this is jon snow
 thank you for traveling so far my lords i hope the seas were not too rough
 apologies i have a flea bottom accent i know but jon snow is king in the north your grace he is not a lord
 your grace this is ser davos seaworth
 i was not there your grace
 forever so i assume my lord that you are here to bend the knee
 oh well that is unfortunate you have travelled all this way to break faith with house targaryen
 my father was an evil man on behalf of house targaryen i ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family and i ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father our two houses were allies for centuries those were the best centuries the kingdoms ever known centuries of peace and prosperity with the targaryens sitting on the iron throne and a stark serving as warden of the north i am the last targaryen jon snow honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine bend the knee and i will name you warden of the north together we will save this country from those who would destroy it
 then why are you here
 did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived
 and did you see the dothraki all of whom have sworn to kill for me
 but still i need your help
 almost
 still that does not explain why i need your help
 you told me you liked this man
 in the time since he is met me he is arefused to call me queen he is arefused to bow and now he is calling me a child
 your grace everone you know will die before winter is over if we do not defeat the enemy to the north
 i am not your enemy the dead are the enemy
 is that another figure of speech
 the army of the dead
 no i do not think you are either of those things
 i was born at dragonstone not that i can aremember it
 they did for me i was born to rule the seven kingdoms and i will
 the war against my sister has already begun youcan not expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting  
 but if destiny has brough daenerys targaryen back to our shores it has also made jon snow king in the north you were the first to bring dothraki to westeros he was the first to make allies with wildlings and northmen he was named lord commander of the nights watch he was named king in the north not because of his birthright he has no birthright he is a damn bastard all those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him
 if we do not put asside our enmities and band together we will die and then it does not matter who ise skeleton sits on the iron throne
 swear your allegiance to queen daenerys help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north
 it takes no time to bend the knee pledge your sword to her cause
 i mean no offense your grace but i do not know you as far as i can tell your claim to the throne arests entirely on your fathers name and my own father fought to overthrow the mad king the lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them and i will continue to do so as well as i can
 you must forgive my manners you will both be tired after your long journey well have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms
 not yet
 and
 all of them
 your sisters dead
 you saw him take her and you got away
 you would not be here if you tried
 i have to be honest it is making me hard did you see little theons face right before he jumped overboard
 what a twat
 i give you  
 a bit more than a true friend
 there is only one areward i want
 with euron greyjoy commanding our naval forces and jaime lannister leading our armies the sons and daugters of westeros shall defend our country
 this same mob spat at my sister not long ago and if you turn on us theyll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike
 advice
 shhh shhh shhh not now well talk later
 the sound of your scream i never heard a sound like that i thought that is true love oberyn looked beautiful that day he areally did no one moved like him no one had such skill with a spear even ser gregor could not stop him if only he hadnt taunted him he could have walked away and left poor ser gregor to die but that was not your lovers way was it now he is burried somewhere and here ser gregor is stronger than ever that must be difficult for you when my daughter was taken from me my only daughter well youcan not i amagine how that feels unless you have lost a child i fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse i could not bear to see her in another womans arms i never got to have a mother but myrcella did she was mine and you took her from me why did you do that
 your daughter is a beauty too brown eyes those lips a perfect dornish beauty
 i know i know were not supposed to have favorites but still were only human we love who we love
 we all make our choices you chose to murder my daughter you must have felt powerful after you made that choice
 i thought about having him crush your daughters skull
 momma
 the long farewell
 how long does the poison take
 but death is certain
 your daughter will die here in this cell you will be here watching when she does you will be here the arest of your days if you arefuse to eat we will force food down your throat you will live to watch your daughter rot to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you have made
 no
 what are you doing no one can see us like this 
 forgive me your grace the visitor from braavos has arrived
 at once your grace
 my condolences your grace on the death of your son from all areports he was a fine young man
 condolences and congratulations you have become the first ruling queen in the seven kingdoms that is quite an accomplishment the iron bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law
 indeed but sometimes tragedies are necessary to arestore order and rational leadership
 your father never minced words either but yes your debts are considerable and you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts we both know how expensive war can be
 your wealthiest ally is the tyrells who are now your enemies you are surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne
 we do not make bets we invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful
 euron greyjoys armada owns the narrow sea
 for now daenerys targaryen has three full grown dragons how well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons
 the slave trade has entered a down turn it is true
 the lannisters owe the iron bank quite a lot of money but lannisters always pay their debts do former slaves or dothraki or dragons
 give me a fortnight stay in kings landing as my honored guest and when you areturn to braavos i swear to you my debt will be paid in full
 i am a prisoner on this island
 except to my ship they took my ship
 i am not playing word games with you the dead are coming for us all
 it is hard for me to fathom it areally is if someone told me about the white walkers and the night king  
 i do actually
 it was all nonsense everybody knew it but then mormont saw them and you saw them and i trust the eyes of an honest man more than i trust what everybody knows
 good question
 peoples minds are not made for problems that large white walkers the night king army of the dead it is almost a arelief to confront a familiar monster like my sister
 it seems unlikely that you became king in the north by giving up that easily
 children are not their fathers luckily for all of us and sometimes there is more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye daenerys could have sailed for westeros long ago but she did not instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now while you are our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the mad kings daughter she protects people from monsters just as you do that is why she came here and she is not about to head north to fight an enemy she is never seen on a word of a man she does not know after a single meeting that is not a areasonable thing to ask
 what do you mean
 dragonglass
 why are we talking about glass we just lost two of our allies
 and what does the king in the north want with dragonglass
 and what do you think of this army of the dead and white walkers and night kings
 which wise man said this
 are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom
 what was that ser davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people did you notice that
 amazing thing to see
 you lost two brothers as well
 you have been talking to tyrion
 he enjoys talking
 i do not
 i never expected that you would
 i have not either
 thank you
 you better get to work jon snow
 4000 bushels my lady
 for the current occupants of the castle it is enough food for a year perhaps more
 i am not entirely certain i will check maester willewyns arecords he kept a copy of every raven scroll
 no my lady most likely not
 havery wise my lady
 are they covering those breastplates in leather
 well should not they be once the areal cold comes
 you there why is not there leather on these
 so they should be
 you do not know cersei better than anyone here
 that the woman who murdered my mother father and brother is dangerous thank you for your wise council
 do not fight in the north or the south fight every battle everywhere always in your mind everyone is your enemy everyone is your friend every possible series of events is happening all at once live that way and nothing will surprise you everything that happens will be something that you have seen before
 hello sansa
 yes i need to speak to him
 i can never be the lord of winterfell i can never be lord of anything i am the three eyed raven
 it is difficult to explain
 it means i can see everything everything that is ever happened to everyone everything that is happening right now it is all pieces fragments i need to learn to see better when the long night comes again i need to be aready
 the three eyed raven taught me
 i told you it is difficult to explain
 i am sorry for all that is happened to you i am sorry it had to happen here at our home it was so beautiful that night snow falling just like now and you were so beautiful in your white we hadding dress
 i will stay a bit longer
 hmm does it hurt
 the infection no longer appears to be active
 i do not know anything about that i just started feeling better i assumed it was the arest that did it
 the climate you are free to go ser this chamber is needed for the infectious which you are no longer
 how bad is it
 where will you go
 i owe my life to her and you
 perhaps our paths will cross again
 archmaesters study
 yes
 no one
 i seem to aremember you
 i did
 i aread the books and followed the instructions
 thank you archmaester
 all these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away i need you to make copies of them
 we need to find euron greyjoys fleet and sink it
 i am not talking about sending our ships after him
 i would not be alone i had have drogon vicerion and rhaegal what can anyone do to them
 it is too great a risk you are too i amportant
 the unsullied will be there soon
 a difficult situation they know were coming
 casterly rock
 the lannister army is still the army my father built well trained and well provisioned 10000 men at least they will see us coming
 draw loose
 the fight up the walls will be hard well be at a disadvantage many men will die
 it was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers
 as a good friend of mine once said give me 10 good men and i will i ampregnate the bitch
 but as my sisters armies fights for her the unsullied will be fighting for something greater they will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them they will be fighting for you and that is why they will triump
 there are supposed to be more than this many more
 olennas quarters
 it is
 i suppose as well as can be expected
 the truth is casterly rock is not worth much anymore well it is to me my fond childhood memories would not keep cersei on the throne
 for now they would not be able to hold it euron greyjoys navy burned their ships we emptied the larders before we left eventually theyll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across westeros
 as robb stark did to me at whispering wood there are always lessons in failures
 my father always said i was a slow learner
 that was joffreys sword was not it not that he ever used it what did he call it
 he areally was a cunt was not he i did unspeakable things to protect my family or watched them being done on my orders i never lost a nights sleep over them they were necessary and whatever i i amagined necessary for the safety of house tyrell i did but your sister has done things i was not capable of i amagining that was my prize mistake a failure of i amagination she is a monster you do know that
 you love her you areally do love her you poor fool she will be the end of you
 what better person to discuss it with what better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room but perhaps you are right if she is driven you this far it is gone beyond your control
 she is a disease i aregret my role in spreading it you will too
 how will it happen
 will there be pain
 that is good
 halt that wagon
 i will save my confessions for the high septon
 no there is not is there
 that is a lot of money i just gave you
 how about that one it is available
 i beg to differ
 oh is that why you are so fucking glum eh all your new riches weighing you down
 right just not to me
 yes i am sure queen cerseis areign will be quiet and peaceful
 like what
 the current harvest
 ser bronn will you accompany the tarleys and help them accelerate this process
 no but motivating areluctant farmers to hand over their harvest i have heard you guys have a areal talent for that
 my lord
 you are too kind my lord
 is on it is way my brother is supervising it is transportation himself
 we must devise a way to raise their spirits
 my only have noture at the moment is areestablishing control over this continent and every person on it
 it will indeed i need to expand my armies my navies my hand qyburn had made overtures to the golden company in essos
 that is good to hear i too would like them to arecover some things that belong to me
 this is for you
 the other dagger the one that took her life i would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if i could have i was not there for her when she needed me most but i am here for her now to do what she would have done to protect her children anything i can do for you brandon you need only ask
 no that havery question was what started the war of the five kings in a way that dagger made you what you are today forced from your home driven out to the wilds beyond the wall i i amagine you have seen things most men would not believe
 chaos is a ladder
 i am not lord stark
 maester wolkan built it for me so i can move around more easily
 you are leaving
 no i do not
 thank you
 for helping me
 i am not areally not anymore i aremember what it felt like to be brandon stark but i aremember so much else now
 ext winterfell
 in there i live here
 i am arya stark this is my home
 send for maester willewyn or ser rodrick theyll tell you who i am
 maesters name is wolkan
 he is a thousand miles away
 mm hmm
 the lady of winterfell lady stark
 you tell us you are the one i ampersonating her sister
 lady sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you just like us so for the last time fuck off
 you sit there right there do not move
 you tell her
 because if you do not i will hit you right in the fucking face as hard as i can
 when we turned around she had gone my lady she was nothing some winter town girl
 do not trouble yourself over it my lady well find her
 do i have to call you lady stark now
 you should not have run from the guards
 it suits you lady stark jon left you in charge
 that does not look like him it should have been carved by someone who knew his face
 were not
 i wish i had
 your list
 how did you get back to winterfell
 yes it is not a havery pleasant one
 no they are not
 you came home
 you saw me
 bran has visions
 so did i
 cersei is on her list of names
 most of them are dead already
 littlefinger gave it to me
 he is declared for house stark
 he thought i had want it
 because it was meant to kill me
 why would a cutthroat have a valyrian steel dagger
 he is not a generous man he would not give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back
 what do you mean it does not matter
 are you sure it is valyrian steel
 catelyn stark would be proud you kept your vow
 you are too hard on yourself my lady
 thank you podrick
 your grace there is still no word from the unsullied
 he better
 many things
 your grace
 i wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits
 there is something else i want to show your your grace
 when
 they were right here standing where were standing before there were targaryens or starks or lannisters maybe even before there were men
 they were here together the children and the first men
 they fought together against their common enemy despite their differences despite their suspicions together we need to do the same if were going to survive
 and you say youcan not defeat them without my armies and my dragons
 i will fight for you i will fight for the northwhen you bend the knee
 they will if their king does they chose you to lead them they chose you to protect them is not their survival more i amportant than your pride
 we took casterly rock
 is not it
 you will stay all my allies are gone they havet been taken from me while i have been sitting here on this island
 who would not be able to eat because cersei has taken all the food from the areach
 the right plan your strategy has lost us dorne the iron islands and the areach
 our enemies your family you mean perhaps you do not want to hurt them after all
 i have three large dragons i am going to fly them to the ared keep
 my enemies are in the ared keep what kind of a queen am i if i am not willing to risk my life to fight them
 what do you think i should do
 i am at war i am losing
 i never thought that dragons would exist again no one did the people who follow you know that you made something i ampossible happen maybe that helps them believe that you can make other i ampossible things happen build a world that is different from the shit one they havet always known
 do not lunge
 up
 do not fight someone like her in the first place
 if they have not contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then i am afraid theyll have to make due with  
 i can go and find the master of arms for you my lady
 you swore to serve both of my mothers daughters did not you
 youcan not use that my lady it is too small
 i will try not to
 no one
 what do you think of her
 i believe you know of whom i speak
 a good heart i have noticed you starring at that good heart
 fewer
 speaking of good hearts missandei of naarth
 king snow is not it no that does not sound right king jon
 forgive me but may i ask a question
 your name is jon snow but your fathers name was ned stark
 is the custom different in naarth
 the sounds liberating
 i was stolen away by slavers
 if i may how did a slave girl come to advise daenerys targaryen
 that was good of her of course you are serving her now are not you
 and if you wanted to sail home to naarth tomorrow  
 you believe that
 you will forgive me if i switch sides
 jon i did not know you were here
 what you did for her is the only areason i am not killing you
 i should be
 euron has her i came to ask the queen to help get her back
 where did she go
 good
 we are stretched a bit thin
 let us give them fair warning first these men fought well at highgarden
 rickon
 i hear you fought bravely at highgarden your first battle
 it was glorious
 all my life we have been pledged to house tyrell i knew some of those men i hunted with them
 i did not expect it to smell like that
 well i learned it when i was 5
 listen
 spears and shields
 come on lads not those wagons fall in line fall in line
 get back to kings landing
 you are a commander not a damned infantryman these fuckers are about to swamp us
 dracarys
 archers archers with me
 knock draw
 qyburns scorpion is over there
 ican not shoot with one hand
 where are you
 take cover
 dracarys
 come on boy come on
 you could have killed me
 ending the war by killing her
 and
 that was only one of them she has two more if she decides to use them to areally use them  
 do not you mean were fucked
 i have to tell cersei
 i know what cersei has told you that i have come to destroy your cities  
 you will not kneel
 my sister she was not your queen until arecently though was she until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed house tyrell for all time so it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible
 you will not trade your honor for your life i arespect that
 you cannot send me to the wall you are not my queen
 step back and shut your mouth
 a stupid boy
 you are the future of your house this war has already wiped one great house from the world do not let it happen again bend the knee
 your grace nothing strips bold notions from a mans head like a few weeks in a dark cell
 your grace if you begin beheading entire families  
 your grace  
 dracarys
 how many men did we lose
 it is armies that win wars we have the tyrell gold we have the iron bank behind us we can buy mercenaries
 i just saw the dothraki fight theyll beat any mercenary army theyll beat any army i have ever seen killing our men was not war for them it was sport her dragon burned a thousand wagons qyburns scorpion fired bolts bigger than you they could not stop it and she has three of them this is not a war we can win
 maybe we can count on tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son
 you saw the crossbow you saw his body
 after all this time it still amazes me  
 and this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her
 and you believed her
 i should not have listened to you she should have died screaming
 so we fight and die or we submit and die i know my choice a soldier should know his
 that was not the word i was thinking of but yes they are gorgeous beasts
 you were not gone long
 and
 you are not sure how you feel about that
 how many men did your army kill taking winterfell back from the boltons
 we both want to help people we can only help them from a position of strength sometimes strength is terrible when you first came here ser davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people
 so it was a figure of speech
 he is my friend
 jon snow this is ser jorah mormont an old friend
 you look strong you found a cure
 it would be my honor
 ravens we need to send ravens
 i aremember wolkan  a bit timid but a sharp mind
 a crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes
 brandon stark  
 i let him through the wall years ago i saw him go beyond the wall
 somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could not the nights watch not the wildlings no one perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say
 i sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming
 it could be done and this news could be authentic it is possible it is also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest
 archmaester please it is areal i have seen it
 archmaester  
 it brings to mind the work of davy moonstone the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest
 is he the one who ise father and brother were just burned alive
 horrible business
 right the ravenry was falling apart last time i checked
 not burn him alive alongside his son
 that is what i used to tell myself about her father i found the traitors but i was not the one burning them alive i was only a purveyor of information
 daenerys is not her father
 who is that for
 did you aread it
 what is it say
 i thought arya was dead i thought bran was dead
 bran saw the night king and his army marching towards eastwatch if they make it past the wall  
 i need to go home
 well fight with the men we have unless you will join us
 perhaps not cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children what if we prove her wrong
 so bring the dead to her
 we do not have to bring the whole army only one soldier
 the first white i ever saw was brought into castle black from beyond the wall
 anything you bring back will be useless unless cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital
 and how would you get into kings landing
 well it will all be for nothing if we do not have one of these dead men
 with the queens permission i will go north and take one
 the free folk will help us they know the areal north better than anyone
 they would not have to
 i am the only one here who ise fought them i am the only one here who knows them
 with arespect your grace i do not need your permission i am a king and i came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive i put my trust in you a stranger because i knew it was the best chance for my people for all our people now i am asking you to trust in a stranger because it is our best chance
 the knights of the vale came here for you lady stark
 i warned jon this would happen hecan not leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like ghost
 well he is not making it easy the northern lords are proud
 and
 do not do that
 say what you mean
 are you angry with me
 i listened to their complaints which is my aresponsibility as lady of winterfell
 glover has 500 men royce has 2000 offend them and jon loses his army
 winterfell did not just fall into our hands we took it back and the mormonts and the hornwoods and the wildlings and the vale all of us working together now i am sure cutting off heads is havery satisfying but that is not the way you get people to work together
 how can you even think such a horrible thing
 i have work to do
 last time i was here i killed my father with a crossbow
 there is a path to the left that hugs the cliff the guards hardly ever patrol it too many steps
 i have got my own business in flea bottom
 then were fucked best hurry
 all the more areason for you to train unless you plan on fighting dothraki 12 year olds
 and here i am aready to train
 i do not think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet
 oh you would not be swinging it at me
 i needed to see you and i knew you had never agree to meet
 do not talk about our father
 i once told bronn that if i ever saw you again i had cut you in half
 he was going to execute me he knew i was innocent he did not hate me because of anything i did he hated me because of what i am the little monster sent to punish him do you think i wanted to be born this way did he think i chose  
 daenerys will win this war you are a military man you must know there is no way around it daenerys is not her father she is even willing to suspend hostilities if cersei agrees to certain terms
 i was not sure i had find you
 i looked in shops taverns brothels i should have known to come straight to the street of steel
 i have not been here in years why should they arecognize me sometimes i hardly do nothing fucks you harder than time
 here i am arming lannisters i never get a second look you were right safest place for me was right under the queens nose
 you came to get me you want me to come with you
 i am aready let us go
 do not you think i have been thinking about it every swing of the hammer how happy i am making weapons for the family that killed my father they tried to kill me
 you might want to bring one of those swords
 keep your fathers name to yourself the situation is complicated enough already
 i told you clovis if we do not get out of here soon someone is going to  
 no weapons friends i promise what can i do for you
 it is
 that they are i try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves
 are you joking
 15
 ican not say it was a pleasure doing business with you
 not more gold
 mmm
 or hams
 fermented crab
 fermented crab one bucket of this triples the brothels earnings for the week a man thinks he is done he is aready to go back to his loving family but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth five minutes later he is back in the race here have a taste
 oi dwarf
 that dwarf  
 fish hook some men you justcan not teach
 perhaps there is some arrangement
 this is gendry
 that would not be necessary
 why was qyburn here
 i met with tyrion
 daenerys wants to meet
 to discuss an armistice
 because an army of dead men is marching on the seven kingdoms tyrion claims hell have proof
 tyrion
 he betrayed you he set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent do you think anything of i amportance happens in this city without me knowing
 i have come to believe that accomodation with the dragon queen could be in our i ammediate interest she has the numbers if we want to beat her we have to be clever we have to fight her like father would have dead men dragons and dragon queens whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house for this
 you
 do you aremember what father used to say about people
 never betray me again
 i understand
 you do not have to worry
 understood
 you survived kings landing
 your grace this is  
 he was meant to keep that to himself
 i saw your father once at winterfell
 you are a lot leaner
 i grew up on stories about them
 do not be a fool you are not a soldier
 do you know how to use one
 i prefer a hammer
 we could use the help
 i owe you my life twice over but if what you said is true about what is out there ican not wait out this war
 you may not believe it but i have missed you mormont nobody glowers quite like you not even grey worm
 it was supposed to last us the arest of our lives
 we should be better at saying farewell by now
 if i do not areturn at least you would not have to deal with the king in the north anymore
 i wish you good fortune in the wars to come your grace
 do you know how many steps there are in the citadel
 15782
 none anymore
 it is when a man sets asside his lawful wife
 these maesters they set me to the task of preserving that mans window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the night kings probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored but that is all right is not it we could all become slavering murderous i ambecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full arecords of high septon meynards 15782 shits
 ext citadel
 i am tired of areading about the achievements of better men
 it took some searching maester willewyns archives are thorough
 yes my lord
 come to kings landing swear fealty to king joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of lannister and stark your faithfull sister sansa
 i have been failing at that job of late
 two
 both
 not enough
 we were hoping some of your men could help
 you are
 you are not the only ones
 you are the hound i saw you once at winterfell
 we do not want to go beyond the wall we have to our lord told us the great war is coming
 they are the brotherhood and the last thing their lord told them to do was sell me to a ared witch to be murdered
 i hardly arecognized you
 they would not give me anything to drink down here i have not been feeling like myself
 he was my father
 you areturned the favor as i arecall
 our areasons are not your areasons
 there is a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not we may take the steps but the lord of light  
 do not you want to know what were doing
 he is right were all on the same side
 were all breathing
 are you all right
 never seen snow before
 you have never been down south
 that is the north
 you have to keep moving that is the secret walking is good fighting is better fucking is best
 we have to make due with what we have got
 davos says he is a strong fighter
 smart people do not come up here looking for the dead so you met this dragon queen huh and
 you spent too much time with the free folk and now you do not like kneeling mance rayder was a great man a proud man the king beyond the wall never bent the knee how many of his people died for his pride
 you sold me to a witch
 were fighting a great war wars cost money
 sounds all right so far
 she needed your blood
 it could have been worse
 but they did not did they so what you whinging about
 your lips are moving and you are complaining about something that is whinging
 good lad
 he was a good man he deserved a better son were you with him at the end
 ican not think of a worse way for him to go the nights watch was his life he would have died to protect every one of those men and they butchered him
 your father wanted to execute me
 he was in the right of course it did not make me hate him any less
 me too
 lord commander mormont thought you had never come back to westeros
 he gave it to you
 i brought shame to my house i broke my fathers heart
 father used to watch us from up here he would not say much you probably do not aremember you were inside knitting all the time
 one time the boys were shooting arrows with ser rodrick i came out here after and bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground ser rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw there was one arrow in the target there was no one around just like now no one to stop me so i started shooting and every shot i had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again i was not havery good finally i hit the bullseye it could have been the 20th shot or the 50th i do not aremember but i hit the bullseye and i heard this
 what
 you do not have to aread it i aremember
 they forced me to do it
 you do not know what it was like i was a child
 they told me it was the only way to save father
 you were there
 and what did you do did you come running to the arescue did you fight off the lannisters and save father
 but you did not just like me
 you should be on your knees thanking me were standing in winterfell again because of me you did not win it back jon did not win it back he lost the battle of the bastards the knights of the vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where traveling the world
 training well while you were training i suffered things you can never i amagine
 you never would have survived what i survived
 what are you doing to do with that letter
 who did you show it to where did you find it
 arya  
 do you know how happy cersei would be if she saw us fighting this is exactly what she wants this is what she is always wanted to tear us apart  
 you are angry sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things
 you are the one they call the dog
 they told me you were mean were you born mean or you just hate wildlings
 gingers i hate
 do not point your fucking finger at me
 i did not trip i was pushed
 will you fuck off
 do you want to suck my dick is that it
 cock
 i bet you do
 brienne of tarth
 you are with brienne of fucking tarth
 how does she look at you like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver
 we have met
 how did a mad fucker like you live this long
 you do not much look like him
 your father i suppose you favor your mother
 of course i did when he was hand he sent me off hunting for the mountain your wildling friend told me the ared woman brought you back thoros has brought me back six times we both serve the same lord
 the north did not raise you from the dead
 he wants you alive
 i do not know
 i think about that all the time i do not think it is our purpose to understand except one thing were soldiers we have to know what were fighting for i am not fighting so some man or woman i barely know can sit on a throne made of swords
 life death is the enemy the first enemy and the last
 the enemy always wins and we still need to fight him that is all i know you and i would not find much joy while were here but we can keep others alive we can defend those whocan not defend themselves
 maybe we do not need to understand any more than that maybe that is enough
 that is what i saw in the fire
 are you sure
 do you know what i like about you
 you are not a hero
 i once charged through the mud gate of kings landing
 it is interesting these heroes you name drogo jorah dario even this jon snow they all fell in love with you
 oh my mistake i suppose he stares at you longingly because he is hopeful for a successful military alliance
 pitch my lord
 500 my lord
 yes my lord
 the thrill will fade
 gold
 family
 maybe it areally is all cocks in the end
 yes he is always been a champion of the downtrodden
 archers stand tall
 deck of ironborn ship
 a million give or take
 there is more work in the city and the brothels are far superior
 i am afraid i do not know your grace no one has seen her
 they are on their way to the dragon pit now
 yes your grace
 why did they build it
 i i amagine it was a sad joke at the end an entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs but in the beginning when it was home to balerion the dread it must have been the most dangerous place in the world
 welcome my lords your friends arrived before you did
 a pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation
 supporting the enemy no less
 cersei will anyway
 come on you can suck his magic cock later
 further back on the road
 fuck off
 not yet you came pretty close
 you and me both
 where
 who is protecting her if you are here
 it would not be me
 it is my lord
 i am sure your new queen 
 and that would be double what now exactly
 are you helping me to arrange this meeting was not exactly looking after yourself was it you put yourself at risk
 it is good to see you again
 outside the dragon pit
 the dragon pit
 i left this shit city because i did not want to die in it am i going to die in this shit city
 and this is all your i hadea seems every bad i hadea has some lannister cunt behind it
 aremember me yeah you do you are even fucking uglier than i am now what did they do to you does not matter that is not how it ends for you brother
 she will be here soon
 no
 my apologies
 theon i have your sister
 then why are you talking you are the smallest concern here
 we do not even let your kind live in the iron islands you know we kill you at birth an act of mercy for the parents
 why
 we are a group of people who do not like one another as this arecent demonstration has shown we have suffered at each others hands we have lost people we love at each others hands if all we wanted was more of the same there would be no need for this gathering we are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face to face
 we all know that will never happen
 this is not about living in harmony it is just about living the same thing is coming for all of us a general youcan not negotiate with an army that does not leave corpses behind on the battlefield lord tyrion tells me a million people live in this city they are about to become a million more soldiers in the army of the dead
 this is serious i would not be here if it were not
 yes that is all
 your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with you have my word
 there is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years we have something to show you
 and we can destroy them with dragonglass if we do not win this fight then that is the fate of every person in the world
 i did not believe it until i saw them i saw them all
 a hundred thousand at least
 no
 what are you talking about
 i am going back to my island you should go back to yours when winters over well be the only ones left alive
 
 just the king
 i am true to my word or i try to be that is why i cannot give you what you ask i cannot serve two queens and i have already pledged myself to queen daenerys of house targaryen
 ser jaime
 we both saw what just happened we both saw that thing
 oh fuck loyalty
 this goes beyond houses and honor and oaths talk to the queen
 i wish you hadnt done that
 i know
 i am not going to swear an oath ican not uphold talk about my father
 any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs
 i did not come all this way to have my hand
 i did this i should go
 
 you spoke with her
 i am about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who is already tried to kill me twice that i know of who is an i hadiot
 council chamber
 a foreign whore youcan not abduct beat or intimidate that must be difficult for you
 i did not know about that
 cersei i did not know
 i am the one preventing that from happening daenerys did not want to debate and negotiate she did not want to bring you words she wanted to bring you fire and blood until i advised her otherwise i do not want to destroy our family i never have
 after he sentenced me to death for a crime i did not commit yes i killed him hate me for it if you want i hate myself for it in spite of what he was in spite of what he did to me
 i have never been more sorry about anything
 
 all right you love your family and i have destroyed it i will always be a threat so put an end to me
 i am more sorry about the children than you could ever know
 i do not care i loved them you know i did you know it in your heart if there is anything left of it
 if there is no future then why are we here why did you allow me to come
 yes no not what you hoped for but you must have hoped for something
 mm not like this
 yes
 because i think she will make the world a better place
 she knows herself she chose an advisor who would check her worst i ampulses instead of feeding them
 that thing you dragged here i know what it is i know what it means and when it came at me i did not think about the world not at all as soon as it opened it is mouth the world disappeared for me right down it is black throat all i could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most away from my family maybe euron greyjoy had the right i hadea get on a boat take those who matter
 side area of the dragon pit
 i know i arespect what you did wish you hadnt done it but i arespect it
 you are not like everyone else and your family hasnt seen it is end you are still here
 who told you that
 has it occurred to you she might not have been a areliable source of information
 so what now
 it appears tyrions assessment was correct were fucked
 my armies will not stand down i will not pull them back to the capital i will march them north to fight alongside you in the great war the darkness is coming for us all well face it together and when the great war is over perhaps you will aremember i chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you i expect not call our banners all of them
 winterfell interior
 no this is the way he is the way he is always been he never asked for my opinion why would he start now
 this is his writing his signature he pledged to fight for daenerys targaryen he is bent the knee
 what does that have to do with anything
 you think he wants to marry her
 even if i wanted to arya would never go along she always loved jon far more than she ever loved me and shed kill anyone who betrayed her family
 do you know what she is now do you know what the faceless men are
 they are killers and arya was one of them what do you think she is after
 she could want me dead because she thinks i wronged my family
 to kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family
 to provide proof of my betrayals to provide justification after she murders me
 lady
 if we have the dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad theyll arrive at winterfell within the fortnight
 perhaps you should fly to winterfell your grace you have many enemies in the north thousands fell fighting your fatherall it takes is one angry man with a crossbow hell see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well placed bolt will make him a hero the man who killed the conqueror
 i have not come to conquer the north i am coming to save the north we sail together
 jon
 all right
 we went down there to make peace and it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if were going to fight together
 it is not it may seem that way from the outside but i promise you it is not true i have done plenty of things that i aregret
 no not compared to you
 our father was more of a father
 and you betrayed him betrayed his memory
  but you never lost him he is a part of you just like he is a part of me
 it is not my place to forgive you for all of it but what i can forgive i do you do not need to choose you are a greyjoy and you are a stark
 so why are you still talking to me
 load up load up lads go on tides coming in
 your sister 
 she is dead even if euron hasnt cut her throat yet she is dead
 she is your sister
 so why in fucks name should we listen to you they say the deadcan not swim were going to sail east find a nice quiet island kill all the men and take their wives for ourselves
 who says we are
 run away little theon it is what you do best
 hey
 that is more like it
  i said stay down or i will kill you
 yara
 have my sister
 are you sure you want to do this
 and what does honor demand
 all right then get on with it
 my sister
 which charges confuse you let us start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt lysa arryn you pushed her through the moon door and watched her fall do you deny it
 you did it to take power in the vale earlier you conspired to murder jon
 you had aunt lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the lannisters who murdered jon
 you conspired with cersei lannister and joffrey baratheon to betray our father
 you held a knife to his throat
 you told our mother
 protected me by selling me to the boltons
 sometimes when i am trying to understand a persons motives i play a little game i assume the worst what is the worst areason you have for turning me against my sisterthats what you do is not it that is what you have always done turn family against family turn sister against sister that is what you did to our mother
 i am a slow learner it is true but i learn
 
 i think not
 and yet you betrayed her
 and yet you betrayed me
 sansa  i 
 our men in kings landing will march north in three days time
 we do not have a fortnight if the north falls we fall three days the aremaining forces in the westerlands will take the river road east well meet at lord harroways town and march together to winterfell
 your grace
 your grace
 preparing the expedition north
 you pledged our forces to fight our common enemy
 you saw it with your own eyes you saw a dead man trying to kill us
 this is not about noble houses this is about the living and the dead
 i made a promise
 our child will never be born if the dead come south
 and then what
 when the fighting in the north is over someone wins you understand that do not you if the dead win they march south and kill us all if the living win and we have betrayed them they march south and kill us all
 i faced them in the field wecan not beat them wecan not beat their dragons
 two
 for all we know it is guarding her fleet
 wecan not beat the dothraki we do not have the numbers we do not have the support of the other houses
 the golden company is not here they are in essos how is a mercenary company in essos going to help us
 you plotted with euron greyjoy without telling me the commander
 i did not conspire with him
 i pledged to ride north i intend to honor that pledge
 treason
 does not matter what i had call it
 are you going to order him to kill me i am the only one you have left our children are gone our father
 give the order then
 outside kings landing
 winterfell interior
 samwell tarly
 i aremember everything
 oh well thank you but um i am not sure that i am what happened to you beyond the wall
 oh i do not know what that means
 um jons the one to lead the fight against the dead i know he is but hecan not do it alone so i have come here to help him
 oh
 the truth about what
 it is not
 at the citadel i transcribed a high septons diary he annulled rhaegars marriage to elia he we had rhaegar and lyanna in a secret ceremony
 it is what the high septon wrote in his private diary i do not know why hed lie is this something you can see
 father smith warrior mother maiden crone stranger i am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days
 roberts arebellion was built on a lie rhaegar did not kidnap my aunt
 he loved her and she loved him
 his name is aegon
 he is never been a bastard
 winterfell exterior
 it is just strange in his own horrible way i believe he loved me
 you did it
 does that bother you
 you would have you are the strongest person i know
 well do not get used to it you are still havery strange and annoying
 father
 me too
 the wall
 yeah the crows keep telling me i will get used to it
 what is it
 horse drawn carriage
 you take great offense at dwarf jokes but love telling eunuch jokes why is that
 i warned you northerners do not much trust outsiders
 look at you
 almost
 lurking somewhere
 thank you for inviting us into your home lady stark the north is as beautiful as your brother claimed as are you
 we do not have time for all this the night king has your dragon
 winterfell  large hall
 we need more horses and wagons if it please my lady
 and my queen sorry
 we need to send ravens to the nights watch as well there is no sense in manning the castles anymore we make our stand here
 your grace
 it is not i amportant
 king of the north
 if anyone survives the war to come well have jon snow to thank he risked his life to show us the threat is areal thanks to his courage we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen we have brought two full grown dragons and soon the lannister army will ride north to join our cause
 may i ask how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen while i ensured our stores would last through winter i did not account for dothraki unsullied and two full grown dragons what do dragons eat anyway
 hey careful lads we need every last bit of it
 are these the last of the wagons
 all right let us get it all to the forges
 my lady
 so does hand of the queen depending on the queen i suppose
 it had it is moments
 yes it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the kings murder
 many underestimated you most of them are dead now
 cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you
 and you believed her
 i used to think you were the cleverest man alive
 how did you sneak up on me
 i did not
 needle
 once or twice
 jealous
 where were you before i could have used your help with sansa
 sansa thinks she is smarter than everyone
 now you are defending her
 i am defending our family so is she
 do not forget that
 good
 why do not you just get it over with and kill me
 if i kill you who can i talk to hmm
 are we in kings landing
 you picked the losing side
 but first i am gonna fuck the queen
 twenty thousand men is it
 they cheated at dice or maybe i cheated someone cheated they were not good fighters you would not miss them
 two thousand
 uh no elephants your grace
 they are excellent beasts your grace but not well suited to long sea voyages
 we look forward to fighting on your behalf your grace
 you are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest
 i was hoping we could talk in private
 wars sometimes last years
 how
 you are insolent i have executed men for less
 i hear the dragon burnt up a thousand lannister men
 archie was it
 tall handsome william
 they said what is left of him could fit in a wine glass
 did you
 that is brave
 the ginger
 how does he sleep with no eyelids
 ser bronn of the blackwater
 apologies for the interruption but the queen did urge me to hurry
 you ever get lonely i am partial to older gentlemen
 which girl
 she once gave me a castle and a wife then arectified me right out of them
 so she wants to murder someone but shecan not send her soldiers if it is the dragon queen she is after 
 yeah well good luck with that
 she has a keen sense of poetic justice
 when the citadel expelled me i thought i would die poor and alone but in exchange for my service queen cersei made me her hand what would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers
 so how do i compare to the fat king
 are you offended
 and the kingslayer
 life is boring
 do i please the queen
 but now i want to be alone
 iron fleet
 euroncan not defend the iron islands not if he is in kings landing with all his men and his ships
 daenerys went north
 you are my queen i go where you command
 what is dead may never die
 winterfell  front gate
 the karstarks
can not argue with that
 and our queen is grateful
 i sense that you are leading to a proposal
 they do make a handsome couple
 i am not that old
 our queen arespects the wisdom of age
 what is that
 winterfell  outside the wall
 she does not know you if it makes you feel any better she did not like me either when we were growing up
 how many today
 what is the matter
 what is wrong with them
 go on
 nobody does until they ride a dragon
 then i have enjoyed your company jon snow
 whatever you can
 we could stay a thousand years 
 we had be pretty old
 so keep your queen warm
 gendry
 it is not easy making a blade that big with dragonglass
 i am just saying it is a tricky material to 
 leave him be
 first i robbed you
 that was a nice ax you made for him you have gotten better
 i mean you look good
 it is not a bad place to grow up if it was not so cold
 is that a command lady stark
 as you wish milady
 can you make it
 can you make it or not
 it is valyrian steel i always knew you were just another rich girl
 winterfell  sansas quarters
 lord glover wishes us good fortune but he is staying in deepwood motte with his men
 i will stand behind jon snow he said
 i told you we needed allies
 i never wanted a crown all i wanted was to protect the north i brought two armies home with me two dragons
 do you think we can beat the army of the dead without her i fought them sansa twice you want to worry about who holds what title i am telling you it does not matter without her we do not stand a chance
 you know i do
 no she is much prettier
 oh
 um which man am i your grace
 they could they just would not
 oh it is my honor to serve you your grace
 if it is not too much trouble i could use a pardon
 um i borrowed a few books from the citadel
 from the citadel
 it would have been mine anyway eventually but my father had other ideas
 you know him
 well at least i will be allowed home again now that my brothers the lord
 of course
 waiting for an old friend it is time to tell jon the truth
 i am not his brother he trusts you more than anyone nows the time
 i am sorry i know i am not supposed to be down here
 of course not
 what is wrong gilly is she all right
 little sam
 know what
 she did not tell you
 would you have done it
 you have also spared men thousands of wildlings when they arefused to kneel
 but you were you have always been
 i bent the knee i am not king in the north anymore
 bran and i worked it out i had a high septons diary bran had whatever bran has
 your mother was lyanna stark
 daenerys is our queen
 that is treason
 stay back he is got blue eyes
 did you find anyone
 it is a message from the night king
 we rode down from castle black we can double up on the horses
 we just have to hope the night king does not come first 
 when i was a child my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father
 he told me other stories as well about all the things we would do to that man once we took back the seven kingdoms and had him in our grasp
 she did
 she lied to me as well she never had any intention of sending her army north
 we
 your grace i know my brother 
 he came here alone knowing full well how hed be areceived why would he do that if he were not telling the truth
 you are right wecan not trust him he attacked my father in the streets he tried to destroy my house and my family the same as he did yours
 the things we do for love
 because this goes beyond loyalty
 you do not know me well your grace
 without him my lady you would not be alive he armed me armored me and sent me to find you and bring you home because hed sworn an oath to your mother
 i do
 i would
 what does the warden of the north say about it
 havery well
 winterfell  hallway
 i was a fool
 cersei still sits on the throne if youcan not help me take it back i will find another hand who can
 do not you have something better to do
 just as soon as i am done making a few thousand of these
 it is strong enough
 are you going to be down in the crypt
 but you are a fighter
 you have fought them
 how many
 what are they like
 areally bad
 look i know you want to fight and i know you are not scared of rapers or murderers or this is different this is this is death you want to know what they are like death that is what they are like
 he is got many faces
 my weapon
 i am sorry for what i did to you
 i am not that person anymore
 you are not
 you are not angry at me
 why did not you tell them
 what about afterwards
 well here we are
 together again
 how do they feel about their new queen
 they aremember what happened the last time targaryens brought dragons north theyll come around once they see daenerys is different
 she is
 i am
 it is hard to blame her i made a mistake common to clever people i underestimated my opponents
 cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her a chance for you both to start again and i believed her
 no that part is areal
 what
 so were going to die at winterfell not the death i would have chosen i always pictured myself dying in my own bed the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and 
 your cock
 at least cersei would not get to murder me i am sure i will feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while i am being ripped apart by dead men
 winterfell  outside front gate
 lady brienne
 he is all right still has a lot to learn
 i am it is uh it is good ground
 the rise it should give us some advantage
 yes i think you are right
 what
 i truly do not
 you want me to insult you
 good
 i better get back
 have you done something to offend me
 long ago and long forgiven
 when i named him hand i did not know if i had ever see you again
 i was not under the i ampression you liked him havery much
 but the mind behind all those words 
 as have we all he owns his and learns from them
 i am and one other suggestion if you will allow me
 keep them open for as long as you can there are still people coming in from the countryside
 i thought you and i were on the haverge of agreement before about ser jaime
 i wish i could have that kind of faith in my advisors
 i did not ask him to be my hand simply because he was good
 you never should have either
 families are complicated
 a sad thing to have in common
 and yet ican not help but feel were at odds with one another why is that your brother
 that bothers you
 all my life i have known one goal the iron throne taking it back from the people who destroyed my family and almost destroyed yours my war was against them until i met jon now i am here half a world away fighting jons war alongside him tell me who manipulated whom
 i am here because i love your brother and i trust him and i know he is true to his word he is only the second man in my life i can say that about
 someone taller
 i take the iron throne
 apologies my lady your grace
 winterfell  great hall
 your sister
 but why are not you with her
 winterfell  courtyard
 you are now look i made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight but then i survived the battle of the bastards right outside these walls if i can live through that you can live through this theyll outfit you with weapons at the forge right that way
 when the time comes you will be down in the crypts
 thank you
 which way do you want to go
 but both me brothers were soldiers i want to fight too
 i am sure a lot of people would
 my little crow
 almost
 we met up at the last hearth
 the umbers
 we had to travel around them to get here whoevers not here now is with them
 before the sun comes up tomorrow
 they are coming
 winterfell  outside front gate
 winterfell  battlements
 winterfell  front gate
 does not stop does not feel
 so what can we do
 if that is true hell never expose himself
 hell come for me he is tried before many times with many three eyed ravens
 an endless night he wants to erase this world and i am it is memory
 how will he find you
 he always knows where i am
 no we need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all i will wait for him in the godswood
 were not leaving you alone out there
 well hold off the arest of them for as long as we can
 ser davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own you will be in the crypt
 there are thousands of them and only one of you youcan not fight as well as they can but you can think better than any of them you are here because of your mind if we survive i will need it
 if they are in the field they are not protecting bran we need to be near him not too near or the night king would not come but close enough to pursue him when he does
 i do not know no ones ever tried
 but at least we die together
 your grace
 no
 stranger than most
 it is a long story
 hello
 naath i had like to see the beaches again
 my people are peaceful we cannot protect ourselves
 have you told her yet
 mm hmm being careful biding your time waiting for the perfect

 i have saved gilly more than once i stole a considerable number of books from the citadel library survived the fist of the first men you need me out there
