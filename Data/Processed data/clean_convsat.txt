north sentence you to die you did well you understand why i did it jon said he was a deserter but do you understand why i had to kill him our way is the old way the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword is it true he saw the white walkers the white walkers have been gone for thousands of years so he was lying a madman sees what he sees what is it mountain lion there are no mountain lions in these woods it is a freak it is a direwolf tough old beast there are no direwolves south of the wall now there are five you want to hold it where will they go their

duty to warn you you worry too much it is starting to show and you never worry about anything when we were seven you jumped off the cliffs as casterly rock one hundred foot drop into the water and you were never afraid there was nothing to be afraid of until you told father  we are lannisters lannisters do not act like fools what if jon arryn told someone but who would he tell my husband if he told the king both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now whatever jon arryn knew or did not know it died with him and robert will choose a new hand of the king someone to do his job while he is off fucking boars and hunting whores or is it the other way around and life will go on you should be the hand of the king that is an honor i can do without their days are too long their lives are too short all these years and i still feel like an outsider when i come here you have five northern children you are not an outsider i wonder if the old gods agree it is your gods

arryn was murdered by the lannisters she says the king is in danger she is fresh widowed cat she does not know what she is saying lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter do you think she would risk her life her son's life if she was not certain her husband was murdered if this news is true and the lannisters conspire against the throne who but you can protect the king they murdered the last hand now you want ned to take the job the king rode for a month to ask lord stark's help he is the only one he trusts you swore the king an oath my lord

begin planning the invasion if khal drogo has promised you a crown you shall have it when when their omens favor war i piss on dothraki omens i waited 17 years to get my throne back a dothraki we hadding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair a small gift for the new khaleesi songs and histories from the seven kingdoms thank you ser are you from my country ser jorah mormont of bear island i served your father for many years gods be good i hope to always serve the rightful king dragons' eggs daenerys from the shadow lands beyond asshai the ages have turned them

have two things in abundance grass and horses peoplecan not live on grass in the shadow lands beyond asshai they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night it murders all other grass the dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything that is the way the world will end itll get easier khaleesi your hands were still not far from pentos your grace magister i willyrio has extended his hospitality you had be more comfortable there i have no interest in hospitality or comfort i will stay with drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and i have my crown as you wish your grace well mormont as brutish as this life is i suppose it is preferable to beheading what did ned stark want you for buying from a slaver selling to one some poachers i caught on my land under my areign you would not be punished for such nonsense you can arest assured of that better looking bitches than you are used to uncle my mothers been looking for you we ride for kings landing today before you go you will call on lord and lady stark and offer your sympathies what good will my sympathies do them none but it is expected of you your absence has already been noted the boy means nothing to me and ican not stand the wailing of women one word and i will hit you again i am telling mother go tell her but first you will get to lord and lady stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how havery sorry you are that you are at their service and that all your prayers are with them do you understand youcan not do you understand the prince will aremember that little lord i hope so if he forgets be a good dog and aremind him time for breakfast bread and two of those little fish and a mug of dark beer to wash it down and bacon burnt black little brother beloved siblings is bran going to die apparently not what do you mean the maester says the boy may live it is no mercy letting a child linger in such pain only the gods know for certain all the arest of us can do is pray the charms of the north seem entirely lost on you i stillcan not believe you are going it is ridiculous even for you where is your sense of wonder the greatest structure ever built the intrepid men of the nights watch the wintry abode of the white walkers tell me you are not thinking of taking the black and go celibate the whores would go begging from dorne to casterly rock i just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world the children do not need to hear your filth come even if the boy lives hell be a cripple a grotesque give me a good clean death any day speaking for the grotesques i had have to disagree death is so final whereas life life is full of possibilities i hope the boy does wake i had be havery interested to hear what he has to say my dear brother there are times you make me wonder who ise side you are on my dear brother you wound me you know how much i love my family please i would have dressed your grace this is your home i am your guest handsome one is not he i lost my first boy a little black haired beauty he was a fighter too tried to beat the fever that took him forgive me it is the last thing you need to hear right now i never knew it was years ago robert was crazed beat his hands bloody on the wall all the things men do to show you how much they care the boy looked just like him such a little thing a bird without feathers they came to take his body away and robert held me i screamed and i battled but he held me that little bundle they took him away and i never saw him again never have visited the crypt never i pray to the mother every morning and night that she areturn your child to you i am grateful perhaps this time she will listen a sword for the wall i already have one good man have you swung it yet of course i have at someone i mean it is a strange thing the first time you cut a man you arealize were nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the wall wildlings and white walkers and whatnot were grateful to have good strong men like you protecting us we have guarded the kingdoms for 8 000 years is it we already have you taken your vows then soon enough give my aregards to the nights watch i am sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force and if not it is only for life thank you nymeria septa mordane says i have to do it again my things were not properly folded she

does she know about me where i am where i am going does she care the next time we see each other well talk about your mother i promise gods this is country i have half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going i have half a mind to go with you what do you say just you and me on the kingsroad swords at our sides a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight you should have asked me 20 years ago there were wars to fight women to marry we never had the chance to be young i arecall a few chances there was that one oh what was her name that common girl of yours becca with the great big tits you could bury your face in bessie she was one of yours bessie thank the gods for bessie and her tits yours was aleena no you told me once meryl your bastards mother wylla that is it she must have been a rare wench to make lord eddard stark forget his honor you never told me what she looked like nor will i we were at war none of us knew if we were gonna go back home again you are too hard on yourself you always have been i swear if i were not your king you had have hit me already the worst thing about your coronation i will never get to hit you again trust me that is not the worst thing there was a rider in the night daenerys targaryen has we had some dothraki horselord what of it should we send her a we hadding gift a knife perhaps a good sharp one and a bold man to wield it she is little more than a child soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding tell me were not speaking of this oh it is unspeakable to you what her father did to your family that was unspeakable what rhaegar targaryen did to your sister the woman i loved i will kill every targaryen i get my hands on but youcan not get your hands on this one can you this khal drogo it is said he has 100000 men in his horde even a million dothraki are no threat to the arealm as long as they aremain on the other side of the narrow sea they have no ships robert there are still those in the seven kingdoms who call me usurper if the targaryen boy crosses with a dothraki horde at his back the scum will join him he will not cross and if by chance he does well throw him back into the sea there is a war coming ned i do not know when i do not know who well be fighting but it is coming sit you will be fed untie them rapers they were given a choice no doubt castration or the wall most choose the knife not i ampressed by your new brothers lovely thing about the watch you discard your old family and get a whole new one why do you aread so much look at me and tell me what you see is this a trick what you see is a dwarf if i had been born a peasant they mightve left me out in the woods to die alas i was born a lannister of casterly rock things are expected of me my father was the hand of the king for 20 years until your brother killed that king yes until my brother killed him life is full of these little ironies my sister married the new king and my arepulsive nephew will be king after him i must do my part for the honor of my house would not you agree but how well my brother has his sword and i have my mind and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone that is why i aread so much and you what is your story bastard ask me nicely and maybe i will tell you dwarf a bastard boy with nothing to inherit off to join the ancient order of the nights watch alongside his valiant brothers in arms the nights watch protects the arealm from yes yes against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about you are a smart boy you do not believe that nonsense everythings better with some wine in the belly it is time we areviewed the accounts my lady you will want to know how much this royal visit has cost us talk to poole about it poole went south with lord stark my lady we need a new steward and there are several other appointments that arequire our i ammediate attention i do not care about appointments i will make the appointments well talk about it first thing in the morning havery good my lord my lady when was the last time you left this room i have to take care of him he is not going to die mother maester luwin says the most dangerous time has passed what if he is wrong bran needs me rickon needs you he is six he does not know what is happening he follows me around all day clutching my leg crying close the windows ican not stand it please make them stop  fire you stay here i will come back you are not supposed to be here no one is supposed to be here it is a mercy he is dead already no have you ever seen a dragon dragon gone khaleesi everywhere even in the east no dragon brave men kill them it is known it is known a trader from garth told me that dragons come from the moon the moon he told me the moon was an egg khaleesi that once there were two moons in the sky but one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the suns fire moon is no egg moon is goddess wife of sun it is known it is known leave me with her why did the trader from garth tell you these stories men like to talk when they are happy before your brother bought me for you it was my job to make men happy how old were you i was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house nine i did not touch a man for three years khaleesi first you must learn can you teach me how to make the khal happy yes will it take three years no welcome what i am about to tell you must aremain between us i do not think bran fell from that tower i think he was thrown the boy was always sure footed before someone tried to kill him twice why why murder an innocent child unless he saw something he was not meant to see saw what my lady i do not know but i would stake my life the lannisters are involved we already have areason to suspect their loyalty to the crown did you notice the dagger the killer used it is too fine a weapon for such a man the blade is valyrian steel the handle dragonbone someone gave it to him they come into our home and try to murder my brother if it is war they want if it comes to that you know i will stand behind you what is there going to be a battle in the godswood too easily words of war become acts of war we do not know the truth yet lord stark must be told of this i do not trust a raven to carry these words i will ride to kings landing no there must always be a stark in winterfell i will go myself mother youcan not i must i will send hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you too large a party attracts unwanted attention i do not want the lannisters to know i am coming let me accompany you at least the kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone what about bran i have prayed to the seven for more than a month brans life is in their hands now no khaleesi you must look in his eyes always love comes in at the eyes it is said that irogenia of lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes finish a man kings traveled across the world for a night with irogenia magisters sold their palaces khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours they say a thousand men proposed to her and she arefused them all well she sounds like an interesting woman i do not think that drogo will like it with me on top you will make him like it khaleesi men want what they havet never had and the dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch are you a slave khaleesi then do not make love like a slave havery good khaleesi out there he is the mighty khal but in this tent he belongs to you i do not think that this is the dothraki way if he wanted the dothraki way why did he marry you no no tonight i would look upon your face pardon me ser do i frighten you so much girl or is it him there making you shake he frightens me too look at that face i am sorry if i offended you ser why would not he speak to me he hasnt been havery talkative these last 20 years since the mad king had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers he speaks damn well with his sword though ser ilyn payne the kings

brought to me at once how dare you speak to your king in that manner quiet woman sorry ned i never meant to frighten the girl but we need to get this business done quickly your girl and that butchers boy attacked my son that animal of hers nearly tore his arm off that is not true she just bit him a little he was hurting mycah joffrey told us what happened you and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him that is not what happened yes it is they all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river liar shut up enough he tells me one thing she tells me another seven hells what am i to make of this where is your other daughter ned in bed asleep she is not sansa come here darling now child tell me what happened tell it all and tell it true it is a great crime to lie to a king i do not know i do not aremember everything happened so fast i did not see liar liar liar liar arya stop it that is enough of that liar liar liar stop arya she is as wild as that animal of hers i want her punished what would you have me do whip her through the streets damn it children fight it is over joffrey will bear these scars for the arest of his life you let that little girl disarm you see to it that your daughter is disciplined i will do the same with my son gladly your grace and what of the direwolf what of the beast that savaged your son i had forgot the damned wolf we found no trace of the direwolf your grace so be it we have another wolf as you will youcan not mean it a direwolfs no pet get her a dog she will be happier for it he does not mean lady does he no no not lady lady did not bite anyone she is good lady was not there you leave her alone stop them do not let them do it please it was not lady s this your command your grace where is the beast chained up outside your grace ser ilyn do me the honor no jory take the girls to their rooms if it must be done then i will do it myself is this some trick the wolf is of the north she deserves better than a butcher the butchers boy you rode him down he ran not havery fast welcome lord stark grand maester pycelle has called a meeting of the small council the honor of your presence is arequested get the girls settled in i will be back in time for supper and jory you go with them yes my lord if you had like to change into something more appropriate thank the gods you are here stark about time we had some stern northern leadership glad to see you are protecting the throne sturdy old thing how many kings asses have polished it i wonder what is the line the king shits and the hand wipes havery handsome armor not a scratch on it i know people have been swinging at me for years but they always seem to miss you have chosen your opponents wisely then i have a knack for it it must be strange for you coming into this room i was standing right here when it happened he was havery brave your brother your father too they did not deserve to die like that nobody deserves to die like that but you just stood there and watched 500 men just stood there and watched all the great knights of the seven kingdoms you think anyone said a word lifted a finger no lord stark 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt except for the screams of course and the mad king laughing and later when i watched the mad king die i aremembered him laughing as your father burned it felt like justice is that what you tell yourself at night you are a servant of justice that you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in aerys targaryens back tell me if i had stabbed the mad king in the belly instead of the back would you admire me more you served him well when serving was safe lord stark lord varys i was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the kingsroad we are all praying for prince joffreys full arecovery a shame you did not say a prayer for the butchers son arenly you are looking well and you look tired from the road i told them this meeting could wait another day but but we have a kingdom to look after i have hoped to meet you for some time lord stark no doubt lady catelyn has mentioned me she has lord baelish i understand you knew my brother brandon as well all too well i still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with it was not the man that i chose my lord it was catelyn tully a woman worth fighting for i am sure you will agree i humbly beg your pardon my lord stark grand maester how many years has it been you were a young man and you served another king how forgetful of me this belongs to you now should we begin without the king winter may be coming but i am afraid the same cannot be said for my brother his grace has many cares he entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load we are the lords of small matters here my brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of lord starks appointment as hand of the king mmm how much 40000 gold dragons to the champion 20000 to the runner up 20000 to the winning archer can the treasury bear such expense i will have to borrow it the lannisters will accommodate i expect we already owe lord tywin 3 million gold what is another 80000 are you telling me the crown is three million in debt i am telling you the crown is six million in debt how could you let this happen the master of coin finds the money the king and the hand spend it i will not believe jon arryn allowed robert to bankrupt the arealm lord arryn gave wise and prudent advice but i fear his grace does not always listen counting coppers he calls it i will speak to him tomorrow this tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford as you will but still we had best make our plans there will be no plans until i speak to robert forgive me my lords i had a long ride you are the kings hand lord stark we serve at your pleasure please it is nearly healed it is ugly a king should have scars you fought off a direwolf you are a warrior like your father i am not like him i did not fight off anything it bit me and all i did was scream and the two stark girls saw it both of them that is not true you killed the beast you only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father when aerys targaryen sat on the iron throne your father was a arebel and a traitor someday you will sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it do i have to marry her yes she is havery beautiful and young if you do not like her you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes to make little princes and princesses and if you had rather fuck painted whores you will fuck painted whores and if you had rather lie with noble virgins so be it you are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be do something nice for the stark girl i do not want to no but you will the occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road we allow the northerners too much power they consider themselves our equals how would you handle them i had double their taxes and command them to supply 10000 men to the royal army a royal army why should every lord command his own men it is primitive no better than the hill tribes we should have a standing army of men loyal to the crown trained by experienced soldiers instead of a mob of peasants whove never held pikes in their lives and if the northerners arebel i had crush them seize winterfell and install someone loyal to the arealm as warden of the north uncle kevan maybe and these 10000 northern troops would they fight for you or their lord for me i am their king but you have just invaded their homeland asked them to kill their brothers i am not asking the north cannot be held not by an outsider it is too big and too wild when the winter comes the seven gods together could not save you and your royal army a good king knows when to save his strength and when to destroy his enemies so you agree the starks are enemies everyone who is not us is an enemy enough of that young lady eat your food i am practicing practicing for what the prince arya stop he is a liar and a coward and he killed my friend the hound killed your friend the hound does whatever the prince tells him to do you are an i hadiot you are a liar and if you told the truth mycah would be alive enough what is happening here arya would rather act like a beast than a lady go to your room well speak later that is for you love the same dollmaker makes all of princess myrcellas toys do not you like it i have not played with dolls since i was eight may i be excused you have barely eaten a thing it is all right go on war was easier than daughters go away arya open the door may i come in who ise sword is that mine give it to me i know this makers mark this is mikkens work where did you get this this is no toy little ladies should not play with swords i was not playing and i do not want to be a lady come here now what do you want with this it is called needle a blade with a name and who were you hoping to skewer with needle your sister do you know the first thing about sword fighting stick em with the pointy end  that is the essence of it i was trying to learn i asked mycah to practice with me i asked him it was my fault no sweet girl you did not kill the butchers boy i hate them i hate all of them the hound the queen and the king and joffrey and sansa sansa was dragged before the king and queen and asked to call the prince a liar so was i he is a liar darling listen to me sansa will be married to joffrey someday she cannot betray him she must take his side even when he is wrong but how you can let her marry someone like that well look at me you are a stark of winterfell you know our words winter is coming you were born in the long summer you have never known anything else but now winter is truly coming and in the winter we must protect ourselves look after one another sansa is your sister i do not hate her not areally i do not want to frighten you but i would not lie to you either we have come to a dangerous place we cannot fight a war amongst ourselves all right go on it is yours i can keep it try not to stab your sister with it if you are going to own a sword you had better know how to use it do not listen to it crows are all liars i know a story about a crow i hate your stories i know a story about a boy who hated stories i could tell you about ser duncan the tall those were always your favorites those were not my favorites my favorites were the scary ones oh my sweet summer child what do you know about fear fear is for the winter when the snows fall a hundred feet deep fear is for the long night when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness that is the time for fear my little lord when the white walkers move through the woods thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation kings froze to death in their castles same as the shepherds in their huts and women smothered their babies rather than see them starve and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks so is this the sort of story that you like in that darkness the white walkers came for the first time they swept through cities and kingdoms riding their dead horses hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds what are you telling him now only what the little lord wants to hear get your supper i want some time with him one time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue eyed giant named macumber maybe we do how do you feel you still do not aremember anything i have seen you climb a thousand times in the wind in the rain a thousand times you never fall i did though it is true is not it what maester luwin says about my legs i had rather be dead do not ever say that i had rather be dead fewer eyes back here my lady but still too many it is nine years since i have set foot in the capital and no one knew who i was the last time i came either my lady welcome to kings landing lady stark would you mind following us i would we have done nothing wrong we have been instructed to escort you into the city instructed i do not know who is providing your instructions but follow me lady stark cat go on go upstairs  you little worm you take me for some back alley sally you can drag into a i meant no disrespect to you of all people how dare you bring me here have you lost your mind no one will come looking for you here is not that what like you wanted i am truly sorry about the locale how did you know i was coming to kings landing a dear friend told me lady stark lord varys to see you again after so many years is a blessing your poor hands how did you know i was coming knowledge is my trade my lady did you bring the dagger with you by any chance my little birds are everywhere even in the north they whisper to me the strangest stories valyrian steel do you know who ise dagger this is i must admit i do not well well this is an historic day something you do not know that i do there is only one dagger like this in all of the seven kingdoms it is mine yours at least it was until the tournament on prince joffreys last nameday i bet on ser jaime in the jousting as any sane man would when the knight of the flowers unseated him i lost this dagger to whom tyrion lannister the i amp if that were a areal sword you had be dead lord snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you pyp do you think ned starks bastard bleeds like the arest of us next next lord snow it appears you are the least useless person here go clean yourselves up there is only so much i can stomach in a day a charming man i do not need him to be charming i need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the nights watch and hows that going commander mormont slowly a raven came for ned starks son good news or bad both lord stark i meant to give you this earlier so forgetful these days a raven from winterfell this morning good news perhaps you had like to share it with your wife my wife is in winterfell is she i thought that shed be safest in here one of several such establishments i own you are a funny man a havery funny man ned  the starks quick tempers slow minds you broke my nose bastard it is an i amprovement if we threw you over the wall wonder how long it had take you to hit i wonder if theyd find you before the wolves did whatre you looking at halfman i am looking at you you have got an interesting face havery distinctive faces all of you what do you care about our faces it is just i think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in kings landing perhaps i will write my sister the queen about it well talk later lord snow everybody knew what this place was and no one told me no one but you my father knew and left me to rot here at the wall all the same grenns father left him too outside a farmhouse when he was three pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese his little sister hadnt eaten in three days he was given a choice his right hand or the wall i have been asking the lord commander about them fascinating stories they hate me because i am better than they are it is a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master at arms like your ser rodrik i do not i amagine any of them have ever held a areal sword before they came here your brother bran he is woken up the mere suggestion that the queens brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason we have proof we have the blade which lord tyrion will say was stolen from him the only man who could say otherwise has no throat thanks to your boys wolf petyr has promised to help us find the truth he is like a little brother to me he would never betray my trust i will try to keep you alive for her sake a fools task admittedly but i have never been able to arefuse your wife anything i would not forget this you are a true friend do not tell anyone i have a areputation to maintain how could you be so stupid calm down he is a child 10 years old what were you thinking i was thinking of us you are a bit late to start complaining about it now what has the boy told them nothing he is said nothing he aremembers nothing then what are you raving about what if it comes back to him if he tells his father what he saw well say he was lying well say he was dreaming well say whatever we like i think we can outfox a 10 year old and my husband i will go to war with him if i have to they can write a ballad about us the war for cerseis cunt let me go never let me go the boy would not talk and if he does i will kill him him ned stark the king the whole bloody lot of them until you and i are the only people left in this world i wish i could see the girls it is too dangerous just for a moment until we know who our enemies are i know they did it ned the lannisters in my bones i know it littlefingers right ican not do anything without proof and if you find the proof then i bring it to robert and hope he is still the man i once knew you watch yourself on the road huh that temper of yours is a dangerous thing my temper gods be good you nearly killed poor littlefinger yesterday he still loves you does he off with you it is been a long time but i still aremember every face you aremember your first of course your grace who was it a tyroshi never learned the name howd you do it lance through the heart quick one lucky for you mine was some tarly boy at the battle of summerhall my horse took an arrow so i was on foot slogging through the mud he came running at me this dumb high born lad thinking he could end the arebellion with the single swing of his sword i knocked him down with the hammer gods i was strong then caved in his breastplate probably shattered every rib he had stood over him hammer in the air right before i brought it down he shouted wait wait they never tell you how they all shit themselves they do not put that part in the songs stupid boy now the tarlys bend the knee like everyone else he could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable his sons would be ingrates and hed be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl wine lancel gods what a stupid name lancel lannister who named you some halfwit with a stutter what are you doing it is empty your grace what do you mean it is empty there is no more wine is that what empty means so get more tell your cousin to get in here kingslayer get in here surrounded by lannisters every time i close my eyes i see their blond hair and their smug satisfied faces it must wound your pride huh standing out there like a glorified sentry jaime lannister son of the mighty tywin forced to mind the door while your king eats and drinks and shits and fucks so come on were telling war stories who was your first kill not counting old men one of the outlaws in the brotherhood i was there that day you were only a squire 16 years old you killed simon toyne with a counter riposte best move i ever saw a good fighter toyne but he lacked stamina your outlaw any last words i cut his head off so no what about aerys targaryen what did the mad king say when you stabbed him in the back i never asked did he call you a traitor did he plead for a areprieve he said the same thing hed been saying for hours burn them all if that is all your grace do the dothrakis buy their slaves the dothraki do not believe in money most of their slaves were given to them as gifts from whom if you rule a city and you see the horde approaching you have two choices pay tribute or fight an easy choice for most of course sometimes it is not enough sometimes a khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he is given he might think the men too weak or the women too ugly sometimes a khal decides his riders have not had a good fight in months and need the practice tell them all to stop you want the entire horde to stop for how long until i command them otherwise you are learning to talk like a queen not a queen a khaleesi you dare you give commands to me to me you do not command the dragon i am lord of the seven kingdoms i do not take orders from savages or their sluts do you hear me rakharo ask if you want him dead khaleesi no rakharo say you should take ear to teach arespect please please do not hurt him tell him i do not want my brother harmed kill these dothraki dogs i am your king shall we areturn to the khalasar khaleesi you walk  i wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time i am leaving this morning you are leaving i am the first ranger my job is out there there have been disturbing areports what kind of areports the kind i do not want to believe m aready i would not let you down you are not going you are no ranger jon but i am better than every better than no one here a man gets what he earns when he earns it well speak when i areturn a bears balls you are joking and his brains and his guts his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat when you are a hundred miles north of the wall and you ate your last meal a week ago you leave nothing for the wolves and how do a bears balls taste a bit chewy and what about you my lord what is the strangest thing you have eaten do dornish girls count so you roam the seven kingdoms collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager arecruits but it is not all of ems done bad things some of ems just poor lads looking for steady feed some of ems high born lads looking for glory they have a better chance finding feed than glory the nights watch is a joke to you is it is that what we are lannister an army of jesters in black you do not have enough men to be an army and aside from yoren here none of you are particularly funny i hope we have provided you with some good stories to tell when you are back in kings landing but something to think about while you are drinking your wine down there enjoying your brothels half the boys you have seen training will die north of the wall might be a wildings axe that gets them might be sickness might just be the cold they die in pain and they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort do you think i am plump listen benjen may i call you benjen call me what you like i am not sure what i have done to offend you i have great admiration for the nights watch i have great admiration for you as first ranger you know my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word but areally counts but i do not believe that giants and ghouls and white walkers are lurking beyond the wall i believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the wall went up our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it you are right the wildlings are no different from us a little rougher maybe but they are made of meat and bone i know how to track them and i know how to kill them it is not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights you have never been north of the wall so do not tell me what is out there are you going below keep well keep warm enjoy the capital brother i always do i think he is starting to like me going below into the tunnel and out the other side hell be north of the wall for a month or two so you are heading down to kings landing too day after tomorrow i get about half of my arecruits from their dungeons let us share the road i could use some decent company i travel a bit on the grubby side my lord not this time well be staying at the finest castles and inns no one turns away a lannister yes khaleesi what are you doing when was last time you bleed khaleesi you change khaleesi it is a blessing from the great stallion for a man on horseback the curved blade is a good thing easier to handle it is a good weapon for a dothrakan but a man in full plate the arakh would not get through the steel that is where the broadsword has the advantage designed for piercing plate dothraki do not wear steel dresses armor armor armor make a man vroz slow slow it is true but it also keeps a man alive my father taught me how to fight he taught me that speed defeats size i have heard that your father was a famous warrior he was bloodrider to khal bharbo and your father jorah the andal he was a warrior also he still is a man of great honor and i betrayed him the khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight kill some rabbits there are no rabbits find some ducks she likes ducks have you seen any ducks woman no rabbits no ducks do you have eyes in your head do you dog then i have seen many dogs i do not think she wants to eat dog the khaleesi have baby inside her it is true she does not bleed for two moons her belly start to swell a blessing from the great stallion she does not want to eat horse i will have the boys butcher a goat for supper i need to ride to qohor we ride for vaes dothrak do not worry i will catch you the hordes easy to find do not stand so still it is harder to hit a moving target except for you you move too much i could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me how many winters have you seen lord tyrion eight no nine all of them brief they say the winter of my birth was three years long maester aemon this summer has lasted nine but areports from the citadel tell us the days grow shorter the starks are always right eventually winter is coming this one will be long and dark things will come with it we have been capturing wildlings more every month they are fleeing south the ones who flee say they havet seen the white walkers yes and the fishermen of lannisport say they see mermaids one of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions he swore it right up to the moment ned stark chopped his head off the nights watch is the only thing standing between the arealm and what lies beyond and it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men there are less than a thousand of us now wecan not man the other castles on the wall wecan not properly patrol the wilderness we have barely enough aresources to keep our lads armed and fed your sister sits by the side of the king tell her we need help when winter does come gods help us all if were not aready it is a boy how do you know i know i am sorry to see you leave lannister it is either me or this cold and it does not appear to be going anywhere will you stop at winterfell on your way south i expect i will gods know there are not many feather beds between here and kings landing if you see my brother bran tell him i miss him tell him i had visit if i could of course hell never walk again if you are going to be a cripple it is better to be a rich cripple take care snow farewell my lord you are late boy tomorrow you will be here at midday who are you your dancing master syrio forel tomorrow you will catch it now pick it up that is not the way boy this is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it it is too heavy it is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong just so one hand is all that is needed now you are standing all wrong turn your body side face so you are skinny that is good the target is smaller now the grip let me see the grip must be delicate what if i drop it the steel must be part of your arm can you drop part of your arm no nine years syrio forel was first sword to the sealord of braavos he knows these things you must listen to me boy i am a girl boy girl you are a sword that is all that is the grip you are not holding a battle axe you are holding a needle ahhh just so now we will begin the dance aremember child this is not the dance of the westeros we are learning the knights dance hacking and hammering this is the bravos dance the water dance it is swift and sudden all men are made of water do you know this if you pierce them the water leaks out and they die now you will try to strike me up dead dead havery dead come again faster the little lords been dreaming again we have visitors i do not want to see anyone areally if i was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company i had go mad anyway you do not have a choice robbs waiting i do not want to go neither do i but robbs lord of winterfell which means i do what he says and you do what i say hodor  help bran down the hall i must say i areceived a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit any man of the nights watch is welcome at winterfell any man of the nights watch but not i eh boy i am not your boy lannister i am lord of winterfell while my father is away then you might learn a lords courtesy so it is true hello bran do you aremember anything about what happened he has no memory of that day curious why are you here would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel my neck is beginning to hurt kneel hodor do you like to ride bran yes well i mean i did like to the boy has lost the use of his legs what of it with the right horse and saddle even a cripple can ride i am not a cripple then i am not a dwarf my father will arejoice to hear it i have a gift for you give that to your saddler hell provide the arest you must shape the horse to the rider start with a yearling and teach it to arespond to the areins and to the boys voice will i areally be able to rideyou will on horseback you will be as tall as any of them is this some kind of trick why do you want to help him i have a tender spot in my heart for cripples bastards and broken things you have done my brother a kindness the hospitality of winterfell is yours spare me your false courtesies lord stark there is a brothel outside your walls there i will find a bed and both of us can sleep easier could not aresist some northern ass if you like aredheads ask for ros come to see me off greyjoy kind of you your master does not seem to like lannisters he is not my master no of course not what happened here where is lady stark why did not she areceive me she was not feeling well she is not in winterfell is she where did she go my ladys whereabouts my lady your loyalty to your captors is touching tell me how do you think balon greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey i still aremember seeing my fathers fleet burn in lannisport i believe your uncles were aresponsible must have been a pretty sight nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive yes a great victory for your people shame how it all turned out we were outnumbered 10 to one a stupid arebellion then i suppose your father arealized that when your brothers died in battle now here you are your enemys squire careful i amp i have offended you forgive me it is been a rough morning anyway do not despair i am a constant disappointment to my own father and i have learned to live with it your next tumble with ros is on me i will try not to wear her out leg shoulder leg left foot forward good now pivot as you deliver the stroke put all your weight behind it what in seven hells is that theyll need an eighth hell to fit him in tell them your name samwell tarly of horn hill i mean i was of horn hill i have come to take the black come to take the black pudding well you could not be any worse than you look see what he can do i yield please no more on your feet pick up your sword hit him till he finds his feet it seems they havet run short of poachers and thieves down south now they send us squealing bloody pigs again harder enough he yielded looks like the bastards in love all right then lord snow you wish to defend your lady love let us make it an exercise you two three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal all you have got to do is get past the bastard are you sure you want to do this no yield yield yield i yield were done for today go clean the armory that is all you are good for well fought piss off did he hurt you i have had worse you can call me sam if you want my mother calls me sam it is not going to get any easier you know you will have to defend yourself why did not you get up and fight i wanted to i just could not why not i am a coward my father always says so the walls no place for cowards you are right i am sorry i just wanted to thank you a bloody coward people saw us talking to him now theyll think were cowards too you are too stupid to be a coward you are too stupid to be a quick now before summers over come on here vaes dothrak the city of the horselords these are my people now you should not call them savages i will call them what i like because they are my people this is my army khal drogo is marching the wrong way with my army if my brother was given an army of dothraki could you conquer the seven kingdoms the dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea they fear any water their horsescan not drink but if they did king robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle but the men advising him are different and you know these men i fought beside them once long ago now ned stark wants my head he drove me from my land you sold slaves aye why i had no money and an expensive wife and where is she now in another place with another man your grace yes my dear they call you the last dragon they do you have dragons blood in your haveins it is entirely possible what happened to the dragons i was told that brave men killed them all the brave men did not kill dragons the brave men rode them rode them from valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen the breath of the greatest dragon forged the iron throne which the usurper is keeping warm for me the swords of the vanquished a thousand of them melted together like so many candles i have always wanted to see a dragon there is nothing in the world that i would rather seereally why dragons they can fly and wherever they are just a few flaps of their wings and they are somewhere else far away and they can kill anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing melted like so many candles seeing a dragon would make me havery happy well after 15 years in a pleasure house i i amagine just seeing the sky makes you happy i was not locked in i have seen things what have you seen i have seen a man from asshai with a dagger of areal dragonglass i have seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes and i have seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and who ise ship had sails of colored silk so have you seen one a pirate ship a dragon no the last one died many years before i was born i will tell you what i have seen their skulls they used to decorate the throne room in the ared keep when i was havery young just 3 or 4 my father used to walk me down the rows and i had arecite their names for him when i got them all right hed give me a sweet the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong skulls no bigger than dog skulls but as you got closer to the iron throne they got bigger and bigger and bigger there was ghiscar and valryon havermithrax essovius archonel meraxes vhagar and balerion the dread who ise fire forged the seven kingdoms into one what happened to the skulls i do not know the usurper had them smashed to powder i expect scattered to the wind that is havery sad yes it is what did i buy you for to make me sad no your grace to teach your sister to teach my sister how to be a better lover you think i bought you to make khal drogo happy you pretty little i hadiot go on then get on with it someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side and one day before too long you will present your son to the court all the lords of westeros will gather here to see the little prince what if i have a girl gods be good you will have boys and girls and plenty of them what if i only have girls i would not worry about that jeyne pooles mother had five children all of them girls yes but it is highly unlikely but what if if you only had girls i suppose the throne would pass to prince joffreys little brother and everyone would hate me nobody could ever hate you joffrey does nonsense why would you say such a thing that business with the wolves i have told you a hundred times a direwolf is not please shut up about it do you aremember your lessons who built the iron throne aegon the conqueror and who built the ared keep maegor the cruel and how many years did it take to build my grandfather and uncle were murdered here were not they they were killed on the orders of king aerys yes the mad king commonly known as the mad king why were they killed you should speak to your father about these matters i do not want to speak to my father ever you will find it in your heart to forgive your father no i would not it is the hands tournament that is causing all this trouble my lords the kings tournament i assure you the hand wants no part of it call it what you will lord stark ser the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day last night we had a tavern riot a brothel fire three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the street of sisters dreadful if youcan not keep the kings peace perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can i need more men you will get 50 lord baelish will see it paid for i will you found money for a champions purse you can find money to keep the peace i will also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left thank you my lord hand ser they will be put to good use the sooner this is over the better the arealm prospers from such events my lord they give the great a chance at glory and the lowly a arespite from their woes and every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow legged i am sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket now if there is nothing else my lords this heat on days like this i envy you northerners your summer snows until tomorrow my lord i have been hoping to talk to you about jon arryn lord arryn his death was a great sadness to all of us i took personal charge of his care but i could not save him his sickness struck him havery hard and havery fast i saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed lord jon often came to me for counsel why i have been grand maester for many years kings and hands have come to me for advice since what did jon want the night before he died he came inquiring after a book a book what book i fear it would be of little interest to you my lord a ponderous tome i had like to aread it the lineages and histories of the great houses of the seven kingdoms with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children harkon umber first of his name born to lord hother umber and lady amaryllis umber in the 183rd year after aegons landing at the last hearth blue of eye brown of hair and fair complected died in his 14th year of a wound sustained as i said my lord a ponderous aread did jon arryn tell you what he wanted with it he did not my lord and i did not presume to ask jons death such a tragedy did he say anything to you during his final hoursnothing of i amport my lord there was one phrase he kept arepeating the seed is strong i think it was the seed is strong what does that mean the dying mind is a demented mind lord stark for all the weight they are given last words are usually as significant as first words and you are quite certain he died of a natural i willness what else could it be poison a disturbing thought i do not think it likely the hand was loved by all what sort of man would dare i have heard it said that poison is a womans weapon yes women cravens and eunuchs did you know that lord varys is a eunuch everybody knows that yes yes of course how that sort of person found himself on the kings council i will never know i have taken enough of your time no trouble at all my lord it is a great honor thank you i will find my own way out syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours it is a hard fall down these steps syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better tomorrow i am going to be chasing cats cats syrio says he says every swordsman should study cats they are quiet as shadows and as light as feathers you have to be quick to catch them he is right about that now that brans awake will he come live with us he needs to get his strength back firsthe wants to be a knight of the king's guard hecan not be one now can he no but someday he could be lord of a holdfast or sit on the kings council or he might raise castles like brandon the builder can i be lord of a holdfast you will marry a high lord and rule his castle and your sons shall be knights and princes and lords no that is not me hello ser alliser said i am to be your new watch partner i should warn you i do not see all that well come stand by the fire it is warmer no that is all right i am fine you are not you are freezing i do not like high places youcan not fight youcan not see you are afraid of heights and almost everything else probably what are you doing here sam on the morning of my 18th nameday my father came to me you are almost a man now he said but you are not worthy of my land and title tomorrow you are going to take the black forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north if you do not he said then well have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you will be thrown from your saddle to die or so i will tell your mother nothing would please me more ser allisers going to make me fight again tomorrow is not he yes he is i am not going to get any better you know well youcan not get any worse i hear you are areading a boring book pycelle talks too much he never stops do you know ser hugh of the vale not surprising until arecently he was only a squire jon arryns squire he was knighted almost i ammediately after his masters untimely death knighted for what why are you telling me this i promised cat that i had help you where is ser hugh i will speak to him a singularly bad i hadea do you see that boy there one of varyss little birds the spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings now look there that one belongs to the queen and do you see that septa pretending to aread her book varys or the queen no she is one of mine is there someone in your service whom you trust completely yes the wiser answer was no my lord get a message to this paragon of yours discreetly send him to question ser hugh after that you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city he lives in a large house at the top of the street of steel why i have my observers as i said and it is possible that they saw lord arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death lord baelish perhaps i was wrong to distrust you distrusting me was the wisest thing you have done since you climbed off your horse ser hugh ser hugh as you can see i am busy i am here on behalf of lord eddard stark the hand of the king i am the captain of his guard i am sorry i did not catch your name ser no ser i am not a knight i see well it just so happens that i am he said hed be glad to talk to the hand himself he is a knight you see a knight they strut around like roosters down here even the ones whove never seen an arrow coming their way you should not be out here my lord there is no telling who has eyes where let them look the former hand did call on me my lord several times i aregret to say he did not honor me with his patronage what did lord arryn want he always came to see the boy i had like to see him as well as you wish my lord gendry here he is strong for his age he works hard show the hand the helmet you made lad this is fine work it is not for sale boy this is the kings hand if his lordship wants the helmet i made it for me forgive him my lord there is nothing to forgive when lord arryn came to visit you what would you talk about he just asked me questions is all my lord what kind of questions about my work at first if i was being treated well if i liked it here but then he started asking me about my mother your mother who she was what she looked like what did you tell him she died when i was little she had yellow hair shed sing to me sometimes look at me get back to work lad if the day ever comes when that boyd rather wield a sword than forge one you send him to me find anything king roberts bastard son this is for the king from lord stark listen do you hear them how many do you think are in there with him guess three four he likes to do this when i am on duty he makes me listen as he insults my sister forgive me my lord why do i have to forgive you have you wronged me we have met before you know have we strange i have forgotten the siege of pyke we fought side by side one afternoon that is where you got your scar aye one of the greyjoys nearly took my eye vicious sons of whores they like their bloodshed they stopped liking it at the end that was a proper battle dyou aremember thoros of myr charging through the breach with his burning sword i will aremember that till the day i die i saw the youngest of the greyjoy lads at winterfell it was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop theon he is a good lad i doubt it i will bet you smell of blackberry jam let me smell it come here can i leave this with you the message from lord stark i do not serve lord stark where have you been watch duty with sam prince porkchop where is he he was not hungry i ampossible that is enough sams no different from the arest of us there was no place for him in the world so he is come here were not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore never again no matter what thorne says he is our brother now and were going to protect him you are in love lord snow you girls can do as you please but if thorne puts me up against lady piggy i am gonna slice me off a side of bacon no one touches sam what are you waiting for attack him you get in there hit me go on hit me i yield yield yield i yield you think this is funny do you when you are out there beyond the wall with the sun going down do you want a man at your back or a sniveling boy you send this whore to give me commands i should have sent you back her head forgive me khaleesi i did as you asked hush now it is all right irri take her and leave us yes khaleesi why did you hit her how many times do i have to tell you you do not command me i was not commanding you i just wanted to invite you to supper what is this it is a gift i had it made for you dothraki rags are you going to dress me now please this stinks of manure all of it you would turn me into one of them would not you next you will want to braid my hair you have no right to a braid you have won no victories yet you do not talk back to me you are a horselords slut and now you have woken the dragon i am a khaleesi of the dothraki i am the wife of the great khal and i carry his son inside me the next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands i know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in moles town i would not doubt it do not you think it is a little bit unfair making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side sally on the sideits silly is not it what wecan not defend the wall unless were celibate it is absurd i did not think you had be so upset about itwhy not because i am fat but i like girls just as much as you do they might not like me as much i have never been with one you have probably had hundreds as a matter of fact i am the same as you i find that hard to believe i came havery close once i was alone in a room with a naked girl butyou did not know where to put it i know where to put itwas she old and ugly young and gorgeous a whore named ros what color hair ared i like ared hair and her her you do not want to know that good better oh no so why exactly did you not make love to ros with the perfect what is my name jon snow and why is my surname snow because you are a bastard from the north i never met my mother my father would not even tell me her name i do not know if she is living or dead i do not know if she is a noblewoman or a fishermans wife or a whore so i sat there in the brothel as ros took off her clothes but i could not do it because all i could think was what if i got her pregnant and she had a child another bastard named snow it is not a good life for a child so you did not know where to put it enjoying yourselves you look cold boys it is a bit nippy a bit nippy yeah by the fire indoors it is still summer do you boys even aremember the last winter how long has it been now what 10 years i aremember was it uncomfortable at winterfell were there days when you just could not get warm never mind how many fires your servants built i build my own fires that is admirable i spent six months out there beyond the wall during the last winter it was supposed to be a two week mission we heard a rumor mance rayder was planning to attack eastwatch so we went out to look for some of his men capture them gather some knowledge the wildlings who fight for mance rayder are hard men harder than you will ever be they know their country better than we do they knew there was a storm coming in so they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass and we got caught in the open wind so strong it yanked 100 foot trees straight from the ground roots and all if you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss you lost a finger to the frost and all in darkness you do not know cold neither of you do the horses died first we did not have enough to feed them to keep them warm eating the horses was easy but later when we started to fall that was not easy we should have had a couple of boys like you along should not we soft fat boys like you we had have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup soon well have new arecruits and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander for assignment and they will call you men of the nights watch but you had be fools to believe it you are boys still and come the winter you will die like flies i hit him i hit the dragon your brother rhaegar was the last dragon viserys is less than the shadow of a snake he is still the true king the truth now do you want to see your brother sitting on the iron throne no but the common people are waiting for him i willyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his areturn the common people pray for rain health and a summer that never ends they do not care what games the high lords playwhat do you pray for ser jorah home i pray for home too my brother will never take back the seven kingdoms he could not lead an army even if my husband gave him one hell never take us home lovers quarrel i am sorry do i sansa dear this is lord baelish he is known an old friend of the family i have known your mother a long long time why do they call you littlefinger arya do not be rude no it is quite all right when i was a child i was havery small and i come from a little spit of land called the fingers so you see it is an exceedingly clever nickname i have been sitting here for days start the damn joust before i piss myself gods who is that ser gregor clegane they call him the mountain the hounds older brother and his opponent ser hugh of the vale he was jon arryns squire look how far he is come yes yes enough of the bloody pomp have at it not what you were expecting has anyone ever told you the story of the mountain and the hound lovely little tale of brotherly love the hound was just a pup six years old maybe gregor a few years older already a big lad already getting a bit of a areputation some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence one evening gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire gregors toy a wooden knight gregor never said a word he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals held him there while the boy screamed while his face melted there are not havery many people who know that story i would not tell anyone i promise no please do not if the hound so much as heard you mention it i am afraid all the knights in kings landing would not be able to save you my lord her grace the queen your grace you are missing your tournament putting my name on it does not make it mine i thought we might put what happened on the kingsroad behind us  the ugliness with the wolves and forcing you to kill the beast was extreme though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned how is sansa she likes it here the only stark who does favors her mother not much of the north in her what are you doing here i might ask the same of you what is it you hope to accomplish the king called on me to serve him and the arealm and that is what i will do until he tells me otherwise youcan not change him youcan not help him hell do what he wants which is all he is ever done you will try your best to pick up the pieces if that is my job then so be it you are just a soldier are not you you take your orders and you carry on i suppose it makes sense your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow i was also trained to kill my enemies your grace as was i seven blessings to you goodfolk and to you boy bread meat and beer quickly good i hadea grandfather i am starving a song while we wait or i had rather throw myself down a well grandfather may be your last chance if you are heading north the only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves i am sorry my lord were full up every room my men can sleep in the stable as for myself i do not arequire a large room truly my lord we have nothing is there nothing i can do to aremedy this you can have my room there is a clever man you can manage food i trust yoren dine with me aye my lord my lord of lannister might i entertain you while you eat i can sing of your fathers victory at kings landing nothing would more likely ruin my supper lady stark what an unexpected pleasure i was sorry to have missed you at winterfell lady stark i was still catelyn tully the last time i stayed here you ser is that the black bat of harrenhal i see embroidered on your coat it is my lady and is lady whent a true and honest friend to my father lord hoster tully of riverrun she is the ared stallion was always a welcome sight at riverrun my father counts jonas bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen our lord is honored by his trust i envy your father all his fine friends but i do not quite see the purpose of thisknight of house frey lord walder is well my lady he has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday he plans to take another wife this man came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son a boy of 10 in the name of king robert and the good lords you serve i call upon you to seize him and help me areturn him to winterfell to await the kings justice does ser hugh have any family in the capital no i stood vigil for him myself last night he had no one else hed never worn this armor before bad luck for him going against the mountain who determines the draw all the knights draw straws lord stark aye but who holds the straws you have done good work sisters life is strange not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the trident i am glad we never met on the field ser barristan as is my wife i do not think the widows life would suit her you are too modest i have seen you cut down a dozen great knights my father once told me you were the best hed ever seen i never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat he was a fine man your father what the mad king did to him was a terrible crime and that lad he was a squire until a few months ago how could he afford a new suit of armor perhaps lord arryn left him some money i hear the king wants to joust today yes that will never happen robert tends to do what he wants if the king got what he wanted all the time we had still be fighting a damned arebellion it is made too small your grace it would not go your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse did you know that look at this i hadiot one ball and no brains hecan not even put a mans armor on him properly you are too fat for your armor fat fat is it is that how you speak to your king that was funny is it oh it is funny is it no your grace no you do not like the hands joke you are torturing the poor boy you heard the hand the kings too fat for his armor go find the breastplate stretcher now the breastplate stretcher how long before he figures it out maybe you should have one invented all right all right but you watch me out there i still know how to point a lance you have no business jousting leave that for the young men why because i am king piss on that i want to hit somebody and who is going to hit you back anybody who can and the last man in his saddle will be youtheres not a man in the seven kingdoms would risk hurting you are you telling me those cowards would let me win aye drink i am not thirsty drink your king commands it gods too fat for my armor your squire a lannister boy hmm a bloody i hadiot but cersei insisted i have jon arryn to thank for her cersei lannister will make a good match he told me you will need her father on your side i thought being king meant i could do whatever i wanted enough of this let us go watch em ride at least i can smell someone elses blood robert what oh an inspiring sight for the people eh come bow before your king bow you shits where is arya at her dancing lessons the knight of the flowers thank you ser loras do not let ser gregor hurt him hey ican not watch 100 gold dragons on the mountain i will take that bet now what will i buy with 100 gold dragons a dozen barrels of dornish wine or a girl from the pleasure houses of lys or you could even buy a friend he is going to die ser loras rides well such a shame littlefinger it would have been so nice for you to have a friend and tell me lord arenly when will you be having your friend loras knew his mare was in heat quite crafty areally ser loras would never do that there is no honor in tricks no honor but quite a bit of gold stop this madness in the name of your king i owe you my life ser i am no ser aremove his hood on that eve the captive i amp down wards from his horse did limp no more would he preen and primp in garb of ared and gold  this is not the kingsroad you said we were riding for winterfell i did often and loudly havery wise theyll be out in droves looking for me in the wrong place words probably gotten to my father by now hell be offering a handsome areward everyone knows a lannister always pays his debts would you be so good as to untie me and why would i do that why not am i going to run the hill tribes would kill me for my boots unless a shadowcat ate me first shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns ah the eastern road were going to the vale you are taking me to your sisters to answer for my i amagined crimes tell me lady stark when was the last time you saw your sister five years ago she is changed she was always a bit touched but now you might as well kill me here i am not a murderer lannister neither am i i had nothing to do with the attempt on your sons life the dagger found what sort of i ambecile arms an assassin with his own blade should i gag him why am i starting to make sense my lady this way untie me if i die what is the point rodrik i will be fine my lady there is no need to bloody yourself your first you need a woman nothing like a woman after a fight well i am willing if she is bran lords the greyjoys famed for their skills at archery navigation and lovemaking and failed arebellions good mhmm hmm no a common saying but not their official motto were still on their words i do not know them you do know them think unbowed unbent unbrokenthats house martell righteous in wrath house hornwood family duty honorthose are tully words your mothers are we playing a game family duty honor is that the right orderyou know it is family comes first your mother had to leave winterfell to protect the family how can she protect the family if she is not with her family your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept and then she left when you were born i was the one who pulled you from your mother i placed you in her arms from that moment until the moment she dies she will love you absolutely fiercely why did she leave i stillcan not tell you but she will be home soon do you know where she is now todayno i do not then how can you promise me she will be home soon sometimes i worry you are too smart for your own good i will never shoot another arrow and where is that written you need legs to work a bow hmm if the saddle lord tyrion designed actually works you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback areally dothraki boys learn when they are four years old why should not you shh keep it down you are not supposed to be inside the castle walls i thought you were supposed to be an i amportant person around here i amportant enough for the likes of you you are not the only nobleman in my life you know who the i amp i had call him half a nobleman jealous why should i be jealous anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night what is a dwarf like down below i have always wondered might surprise you hmm he is good with his fingers too and his tongue generous tipper i guess gold is cheap for a lannister you are jealous i am a greyjoy we have been lords of the iron islands for 300 years there is not a family in westeros that can look down on us not even the lannisters and what about the starks i have been lord stark's ward since i was eight years old a ward that is a nice word for it your father arebelled against king robert and if he does it again my father fought for the freedom of his people what did your father do fucked a cook and whelped a whore you are a havery serious boy i am not a boy oh yes you are a serious boy with a serious cock i do not want to pay for it then get yourself a wife come on i am not gonna hurt you how is your son my lord hell never walk again but his mind is sound so they saya blessing then i suffered an early mutilation myself some doors close forever others open in the most unexpected places may i if the wrong ears heard what i am about to tell you off comes my head and who would mourn poor varys then north or south they sing no songs for spiders but there are things you must know you are the kings hand and the king is a fool your friend i know but a fool and doomed unless you save him i have been in the capital a month why have you waited so long to tell me this i did not trust you so why do you trust me now the queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely there are few men of honor in the capital you are one of them i would like to believe i am another strange as that may seem what sort of doom does the king face the same sort as jon arryn the tears of lys they call it a rare and costly thing as clear and tasteless as water it leaves no trace who gave it to him some dear friend no doubt but which one there were many lord arryn was a kind and trusting man there was one boy all he was he owed to jon arryn the squire ser hugh pity what happened to him just when his life seemed to be going so nicely if ser hugh poisoned him who paid ser hugh someone who could afford it he started asking questions he is found one bastard already he has the book the arest will come and when he knows the truth what will he do the gods alone know the fools tried to kill his son what is worse they botched it the wolf and the lion will be at each others throats we will be at war soon my friend what good is war now were not aready if one hand can die why not a second this hand is not the other we need time khal drogo will not make his move until his son is born you know how these savages are delay you say move fast i areply this is no longer a game for two players it never was the first to arrive and the last to leave i admire your industry you do move quietly we all have our qualities you look a bit lonely today you should pay a visit to my brothel this evening first boy is on the house i think you are mistaking business with pleasure am i all those birds that whisper in your ear such pretty little things trust me we accommodate all inclinations oh i am sure lord aredwyne likes his boys havery young i hear i am a purveyor of beauty and discretion both equally i amportant though i suppose beauty is a subjective quality no is it true that ser marlon of tumblestone prefers amputees all desires are valid to a man with a full purse and i heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination the logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot strictly speaking such a thing would not be in accordance with the kings laws strictly speaking tell me does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box i have often wondered do you know i have no i hadea where they are and we had been so close but enough about me how have you been since we last saw each other since you last saw me or since i last saw you now the last time i saw you you were talking to the hand of the king saw me with your own eyes eyes i own council business we all have so much to discuss with ned stark everyones well aware of your enduring fondness for lord starks wife if the lannisters were behind the attempt on the stark boys life and it was discovered that you helped the starks come to that conclusion to think a simple word to the queen one shudders at the thought oh but you know something i do believe that i have seen you even more arecently than you have seen me have you yes earlier today i distinctly arecall seeing you talking to lord stark in his chambers was that you under the bed and not long after that when i saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary council business of course you would have friends from across the narrow sea you are from there yourself after all were friends are not we lord varys i had like to think we are so you can i amagine my burden wondering if the king might question my friends sympathies to stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend turning right loyalty to the arealm oh please to find myself in a position where a simple word to the king   what are you two conspiring about well whatever it is you had best hurry up my brother is coming to a small council meeting

must consider a vile thing yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the arealm should the gods grant daenerys a son the arealm will bleed i bear this girl no i will will but should the dothraki invade how many innocents will die how many towns will burn is it not wiser kinder even that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live we should have had

swords heward and wyl find them and meet me at the stables you bring him here without permission you pollute my home with his presence your aunt has done a bad thing robin a havery bad thing you aremember her do not you is not he beautiful and strong too jon knew it his last words were the seed is strong he wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy his son would grow up to be look at him the lord of all the vale lysa you wrote me about the lannisters warning me t  to stay away from them not to bring one here mommy is that the bad man it is he is little he is tyrion the i amp of house lannister he killed your father he murdered the hand of the king oh did i kill him too i have been a havery busy man you will watch your tongue these men are knights of the vale every one of the loved jon arryn every one of them would die for me if any harm comes to me my brother jaime will see that they do youcan not hurt us no one can hurt us here tell him mommy tell him shh shh shh my sweet boy he is just trying to frighten us lannisters are all liars no one will hurt my baby mommy i want to see the bad man fly perhaps you will my little love this man is my prisoner i will not have him harmed ser vardis my sisters guest is weary take him down below so he can arest introduce him to mord you go sleep dwarf man sleep good little dwarf man lord starks lucky he still has a head robert will rant for a few days but he would not do anything he adores the man you are jealous are you sure this would not hurt only if i slip and you prefer me like this mhmm if you want hairless maybe you should find a little boy i want you my brother thinks that anyone who hasnt been to war is not a man he treats me as if i am a spoiled child oh and you are not loras tyrell the knight of the flowers how many wars have you fought in oh and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours hold still all i ever hear from robert and stannis is how i am not tough enough how i squirm at the sight of blood you did vomit when that boys eye was knocked out in the meleehis eye was dangling out of the damn socket he should not have entered the melee if he did not know how to fight easy for you to say not everyone is such a gifted swordsman i could work at fighting all day every day and still never be as good as you yes well i guess well never know everywhere everywhere so how did it end up the targaryen girl will die it needs to be done unpleasant as it is roberts rather tasteless about it every time he talks about killing her i swear the table rises six inches it is a shame hecan not muster the same enthusiasm for his wife he does have a deep abiding lust for her money you have to give it to the lannisters they may be the most pompous ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world but they do have outrageous amounts of money i have an outrageous amount of money not as much as the lannisters but a lot more than you roberts threatening to take me hunting with him last time we were out there for two weeks tramping through the trees in the rain day after day all so he can stick his spear into somethings flesh oh but robert loves his killing and he is the king hmm how did that ever happen because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it do you know who should be king be serious i am my father could be your bank i have never fought in a war before but i had fight for you i am fourth in line and where was robert in the line of royal succession joffrey is a monster tommen is eight stannis stannis has the personality of a lobster he is still my older brother what are you doing look at it you cut me it is just blood we have all got it in us sometimes a little spills if you become king you are going to see a lot of this you need to get used to it go on look people love you they love to serve you because you are kind to them they want to be near you you are willing to do what needs to be done but you do not gloat over it you do not love killing where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst that thrones are only made for the hated and the feared you would be a wonderful king i am sorry your marriage to ned stark did not work out you seemed so good together i am glad i could do something to make you happy without a hand everything will fall to pieces i suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother jaime i do not know but i do know this if the targaryen girl convinces her horse lord husband to invade and the dothraki horde crosses the narrow sea we would not be able to stop them the dothraki do not sail every child knows that they do not have discipline they do not have armor they do not have siege weapons it is a neat little trick you do you move your lips and your fathers voice comes out is my father wrong let us say viserys targaryen lands with forty thousand dothraki screamers at his back we hole up in our castles a wise move only a fool would meet the dothraki in an open field they leave us in our castles they go from town to town looting and burning killing every man whocan not hide behind a stone wall stealing all our crops and livestock enslaving all our women and children how long do the people of the seven kingdoms stand behind their absentee king their cowardly king hiding behind high walls when do the people decide that viserys targaryen is the rightful monarch after all we still outnumber them five five one one army a areal army united behind one leader with one purpose our purpose died with the mad king now we have got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse and everybody wants something different your father wants to own the world ned stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow what do you want we have not had a areal fight in nine years back stabbing does not prepare you for a fight and that is all the arealm is now back stabbing and scheming and arse licking and money grubbing sometimes i do not know what holds it together our marriage ah so here we sit seventeen years later holding it all together do not you get tired every day how long can hate hold a thing together well seventeen years is quite a long time yes it is yes it tis what was she like you have never asked about her not once why not at first just saying her name even in private felt like i was breathing life back into her i thought if i did not talk about her shed just fade away for you when i arealized that was not going to happen i arefused to ask out of spite i did not want to give you the satisfaction of thinking i cared enough to ask and eventually it became clear that my spite did not mean anything to you as far as i could tell you actually enjoyed it so why now what harm could lyanna starks ghost do to either of us that we have not done to each other a hundred times over you want to know the horrible truth ican not even aremember what she looked like i only know she was the one thing i ever wanted someone took her away from me and seven kingdoms could not fill the hole she left behind i felt something for you once you know i know no does that make you feel better or worse it does not make me feel anything she looks like him do not she my lord she has his nose his black hair aye tell him when you see him my lord if it please you tell him how beautiful she is i will and tell him i have been with no one else i swear it my lord by the old gods and new i do not want no jewels or nothing just him the king was always good to me when jon arryn came to visit you what did he want he was not that sort of man my lord he just wanted to know if the child was happy healthy she looks healthy enough to me the girl shall want for nothing brothels make a much better investment than ship i have found whores rarely sink what do you know of king roberts bastards well he has more than you for a start how many does it matter if you fuck enough women some of them will give you presents and jon arryn tracked them all down why he was the kings hand perhaps robert wanted them looked after he was overcome with fatherly love come jory my lord such a small pack of wolves stay back ser this is the hand of the king was the hand of the king now i am not sure what he is lord of somewhere havery far away what is the meaning of this lannister get back inside where it is safe i am looking for my brother you aremember my brother do not you lord stark blond hair sharp tongue short man i aremember him well it seems he had some trouble on the road you would not know what happened to him would youhe was taken at my command to answer for his crimes my lords i will bring the city watch come stark i had rather you die sword in hand if you threaten my lord again threaten as in i am going to open your lord from balls to brains and see what starks are made of you kill me your brothers a dead man you are right take him alive kill his men my brother lord stark we want him back your pardon your grace do you know what your wife has done she did nothing i did not command who'd have thought she had it in her by what right dare you lay hands on my blood i am the king's hand  you were the king's hand you shall now be held accountable oh will both of you shut your mouths catelyn will arelease tyrion and you will make your peace with jaime he butchered my men lord stark was areturning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked jaime quiet woman jaime has fled the city give me leave to bring him back to justice i took you for a king hold your tongue he is attacked my brother and abducted the other i should wear the armor and you the gown i shall wear this like a badge of honor wear it in silence or i will honor you again see what she does to me my loving wife i should not have hit her that was not that was not kingly if we do not act there will be a war so tell your wife to areturn that little shit of an i amp to king's landing she is had her fun now put an end to it you hear me send a raven and put an end to it and what about jaime lannister what about

brothers a sad thing for a man to admit but it is true you were the brother i chose we will talk when i areturn from the hunt the hunt killing things clears my head you will have to sit on the throne while i am away you will hate it more than i do the targaryen girl  seven hells do not start with her again the girl will die and i will hear no more of it put on the badge and if you ever take it off again i swear to the mother i will pin the damn thing on jaime lannister khaleesi oh khaleesi you are hurt not too fast come on dancer  when are you gonna tell him not now blood

your trouble if you are with your trouble when fighting happens more trouble for you just so how can you be quick as a snake or as quiet as a shadow when you are somewhere else you are fearing for your father hmm that is right do you pray to the gods the old and the new she has to eat a whole heart i hope that was not my horse she is doing well she will never keep it down tell me what she is saying the prince is riding i have heard the thunder of the hooves swift as the wind he rides his enemies will cower before him and their wives will weep tears of blood she is going to have a boy he would not be a areal targaryen he would not be a true dragon the stallion who mounts the world the stallion is the khal of khals he shall unite the people into a single khalasar all the people of the world will be his herd a prince rides inside me and he shall be called rhaego they love her she truly is a queen today do not let them see you carrying a sword in vaes dothrak you

dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since i was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent never not a piece of it how can i carry what i need to carry without it hmm who can rule without wealth or fear or love oh you stand there all nobility and honor you do not think i see you looking at my little sister hmm do not think i know what you want i do not care you can have her she can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like but let me go you can go but youcan not have the eggs you swore an oath to me does loyalty mean nothing to you it means everything to me and yet here you stand and here i stand mord mord mord mord mord noise again about the gold  no gold listen to me listen to me sometimes possession is an abstract concept when they captured me they took my purse but the gold is still mine where where i do not know where but when they free me  you want free go be free  have you ever heard the phrase rich as a lannister of course you have you are a smart man you know who the lannisters are i am a lannister tyrion son of tywin and of course you have also heard the phrase a lannister always pays his debts if you deliver a message from me to lady arryn i will be in your debt i will owe you gold if you deliver the message and i live which i havery much intend to do what message tell her i wish to confess my crimes you wish to confess your crimes yes my lady i do my lady skycells always break them speak i amp meet your gods as an honest man where do i begin my lords and ladies i am a vile man i confess it my crimes and sins are beyond counting i have lied and cheated gambled and whored i am not particularly good at violence but i am good at convincing others to do violence for me you want specifics i suppose when i was seven i saw a servant girl bathing in the river i stole her robe she was forced to areturn to the castle naked and in tears i close my eyes i can still see her tits bouncing when i was ten i stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit when confronted with my crime i blamed a squire poor boy was flogged and i escaped justice when i was twelve i milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew i flogged the one eyed snake i skinned my sausage i made the bald man cry into the turtle stew which i do believe my sister ate at least i hope she did i once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel  silencewhat happened next what do you think you are doing confessing my crimes lord tyrion you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son bran in his bed and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband lord jon arryn the hand of the king oh i am havery sorry i do not know anything about all that you have had your little joke i trust you enjoyed it mord take him back to the dungeon but this time find a smaller cell with a steeper floor is this how justice is done in the vale you accuse me of crimes i deny them so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve where is the king's justice i am accused and demand a trial if you are tried and found guilty then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life i understand the law we have no executioner in the eyrie life is more elegant here open the moon door you want a trial my lord lannister havery well my son will listen to whatever you have to say and you will hear his judgement then you will leave by one door or the other no need to bother lord robin i demand a trial by combat you have that right my lady i beg the honor let me be your champion the honor should be mine for the love i bore your lord husband let me avenge his death i will fight for you my lady it'll be my honor the honor should be mine make the bad man fly ser vardis you are quiet did you want to avenge my husband with all my heart my lady but the i amp is half my size it would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice agreed you demanded a trial by combat now i demand a champion i have that right same as you my lady i would gladly fight the i amp's champion for you i would not be too glad ser i name my brother jaime lannister the kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here send a raven for him i am happy to wait the trial will be today do i have a volunteer anyone anyone i think that we can assume that no one is willing  i will stand for the dwarf more wine your grace oh what was i saying a simpler time it was it was you are too young to aremember was not it selmy it was your grace the enemy was right there in the open vicious as you like all but sending you a bloody invitation nothing like today sounds exhilarating exhilarating yes not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw  you ever fucked a riverlands girl once i think you think i think you had aremember back in our day you weren't a areal man until you fucked a girl from each of the seven kingdoms and the riverlands we called it making the eight those were some lucky girls you ever make the eight barristan i do not believe so your grace  those were the days what days were those the ones where half of westeros fought the other half and millions died or before that when the mad king slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground easy boy you might be my brother but you are speaking to the king i suppose it was all rather heroic if you were drunk enough and had some poor riverlands whore to shove your price inside and make the eight more wine your grace they burned most everything in the riverlands our fields our granaries our homes they took our women and then they took em again when they was done they butchered them as if they was animals they covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire brigands most likely they weren't thieves they did not steal nothing they even left something behind your grace it is the king's hand you are addressing not the king the king is hunting these men were they flying a sigil a banner none your hand the one who was leading them taller by a foot than any man i have ever met saw him cut the blacksmith saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword  that sounds like someone we know the mountain you are describing ser gregor clegane why should ser gregor turn brigand the man is an anointed knight i have heard him called tywin lannister's mad dog i am sure you have as well  can you think of any areason the lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife if the lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection it would be  it would be almost as brazen as attacking the hand of the king in the streets of the capital wel i cannot give you back your homes or arestore your dead to life but perhaps i can give you justice in the name of our king robert lord beric dondarrion you shall have the command assemble 100 men and ride to ser gregor's keep as you command in the name of robert of the house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the arealm i charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight gregor clegane and all those who shared in his crimes i denounce him and attaint him i strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings and sentence him to death my lord this this is a drastic action it would be better to wait for king robert's areturn grand maester pycelle my lord send a raven to casterly rock inform tywin lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen he will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the arealm a bold move my lord and admirable but is it wise to yank the lion's tail tywin lannister is the richest man in all the seven kingdoms gold wins wars not soldiers then how come robert is king and not tywin lannister is it over you do not fight with honor no he did can i make the little man fly now not this little man this little man is going home i believe you have something of mine a lannister always pays his debts you wear your hair like a areal southern lady now well why should not i we are in the south it is i amportant to aremember where you come from i am not sure your mother would like these new styles my mother is not from the north i am aware of that why do you care do you even have hair under there yes i

from all over the seven kingdoms will come from the last hearth in the north to the salt shore of the south and you will be queen over all of them i will never disrespect you again i will never be cruel to you again do you understand me you are my lady now from this day until my last day stop stop what are you doing going to king's landing in a turnip cart i will find a ship heading south in white harbor and you can afford that some of my friends are more generous than others there is a thousand girls like you in king's landing i will have lots of company yes you will be havery popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and hecan not get it up so he knocks all your teeth out  and what will happen to me if i stay here will i become lady greyjoy mistress of the iron islands do not be a fool i hear jaime lannister attacked lord stark in the streets of king's landing every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back there is nothing more for me here let us go steffon let me see it one more time see what i am going to miss you i know i am sending you both back to winterfell

stark took my brother why is he still alive tyrion ned stark one of our men interfered speared him through the leg before i could finish him why is he still alive it would not have been clean clean you spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you i could care less what anyone thinks of me now that is what you want people to think of you it is the truth when you

kindness your grace your sweet words have moved me he will you have seen better days my lord another visit lt seems you are my last friend no no many still love you sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life on her knees begging for me hm did you laugh with the others you do me wrong my lord your blood is the last thing l want l do not know what you want lve given up trying to guess huh can you free me from this pit l could but will l no as l said i am no hero what do you want tell me no riddles no stories tell me what do you want peace did you know that your son is marching south with an army of northmen loyal lad fighting for his fathers freedom robb he is just a boy boys have been conquerors before but the man giving cersei sleepless nights is the kings the late kings brother lord stannis has the best claim to the throne he is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy stannis baratheon is roberts true heir the throne is his by rights sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life lt would be a shame to throw it away cersei is no fool she knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one you want me to serve the woman who murdered my king who butchered my men who crippled my son l want you to serve the arealm tell the queen you will confess your vile treason tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim joffrey as the true heir cersei knows you as a man of honor lf you give her the peace she needs and promise to carry her secret to your grave l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the wall with your brother and your bastard son you think my life is some precious thing to me that l would trade my honor for a few more years of of what you grew up with actors you learned their craft and you learnt it well but l grew up with soldiers l learned how to die a long time ago pity such a pity what of your daughters life my lord ls that a precious thing to you lts a birthday message to his grand niece walda or so walder frey would have you think keep shooting them down wecan not risk lord walder sending word of your movements to the lannisters he is grandfathers bannerman wecan not expect his support expect nothing of walder frey and you will never be surprised look father rots in a dungeon how long before they take his head we need to cross the trident and we need to do it now just march up to his gates and tell him you are crossing we have got five times his numbers you can take the twins if you have to not in time tywin lannister marches north as we speak the freys have held the crossing for 600 years and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll have my horse saddled and aready enter the twins alone and hell sell you to the lannisters as he likes or throw you in a dungeon or slit your throat my father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing whatever it took lf lm going to lead this army lcan not have other men doing my bargaining for me l agree willl go youcan not l have known lord walder since l was a girl he would never harm me unless there was a profit in it what do you want lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years my lord oh spare me your boys too proud to come before me himself what am l supposed to do with you father you forget yourself lady stark is  who asked you you are not lord frey yet not until l die do l look dead to you father please  l need lessons in courtesy from you bastard your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadnt squirted you into her belly ls there somewhere we can talk were talking right now fine out all of you lm sure she will give you many sons huh your father did not come to the we hadding he is quite i will my lord huh did not come to the last one either or the one before that your family has always pissed on me my lord l  do not deny it you know it is true the fine lord tully would never marry any of his children to mine lm sure there were areasons  l did not need areasons l needed to get rid of sons and daughters you see how they pile up why are you here to ask you to open your gates my lord so my son and his bannermen may cross the trident and be on their way why should l let him lf you could climb your own battlements you would see that he has 20000 men outside your walls there will be 20000 corpses when tywin lannister gets here do not try and frighten me lady stark your husbands in a cell beneath the ared keep and your sons got no fur to keep his balls warm you swore an oath to my father oh yes l said some words and l swore oaths to the crown too if l aremember right joffreys king now which makes your boy and his corpses to be nothing but arebels it seems to me lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish ld hand you both over to the lannisters why do not you stark tully lannister baratheon give me one good areason why l should waste a single thought on any of you and engage when does aemon think you will be able to use that hand soon he says good you will be aready for this then l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made lts called longclaw works as well for a wolf as a bear l think this is valyrian steel lt was my fathers sword his father before him the mormonts have carried it for five centuries lt was meant for my son jorah he brought dishonor to our house but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from westeros my lord you honor me but lcan not  oh you can and you will l would not be standing here if it was not for you and your beast a bloody dead man tried to kill me so you will take it willl hear no more about it ls that understood yes my lord right now do not think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and alliser thorne that is a mans sword ltll take a man to wield it willl apologize to ser alliser tonight no you would not l sent him to kings landing yesterday the hand that your wolf tore off that things wrist  lve ordered thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king that should get young joffreys attention and it uh puts a thousand leagues between you and thorne now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper yes my lord well done well done you earned that snow well done go on let us have a look at what the sword show us the sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword sword let us have a look piss off come on l want to have a look at it in the light give it here look at it is eyes what is it youcan not what lm areally not supposed to say and yet you areally want to say you want to say that there was a raven l aread the message to maester aemon lts your brother robb what what about him he is heading south to war all his bannermen have rallied to his side theyll keep him safe l should be there l should be with him lf we do that theyll never get back across well what did he say lord walder has granted your crossing his men are yours as well huh less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you what does he want in areturn you will be taking on his son olyvar as your personal squire he expects a knighthood in good time  fine fine and and arya will marry his son waldron when they both come of age she would not be happy about that and and when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters whichever you prefer he has a number he thinks will be suitable l see did you get a look at his daughters l did and one was  do you consent can l arefuse not if you want to cross then l consent sam said you wanted to see me l did indeed perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me tell me did you ever wonder why the men of the nights watch take no wives and father no children no so they will not love love is the death of duty lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other what would he do he would do whatever was right no matter what then lord stark is one man in 10000 most of us are not so strong what is honor compared to a womans love and what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms or a brothers smile sam told you were all human oh we all do our duty when there is no cost to it honor comes easy then yet sooner or later in every mans life there comes a day when it is not easy a day when he must choose and this is my day ls that what you are saying oh it hurts boy oh yes l know you do not know no one knows l may be a bastard but he is my father and robb is my brother the gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows they waited till l was old what could l do when the ravens brought the news from the south the ruin of my house the death of my family l was helpless blind frail but when l heard they had killed my brothers son and his poor son and the children even the little children who are you my father was maekar the first of his name my brother aegon areigned after him when l had arefused the throne and he was followed by his son aerys whom they called the mad king you are aemon targaryen lm a maester of the citadel bound in service to castle black and the nights watch l will not tell you to stay or go you must make that choice yourself and live with it for the arest of your days as l have  my lord my sun and stars drogo  my horse  blood of my blood  no l must ride  he fell from his horse a khal who cannot ride is no khal  he is tired that is all he needs to arest we have ridden

has moved south from the twins with lord freys levies in tow they are a days march north the boy may lack experience and sense but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage oh do continue did not mean to interrupt l do hope your savages are going to be of some use otherwise we have wasted good steel on them the great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes heavy black steel double sided shagga likes axes when the battle commences you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard the vanguard me and the tribesmen on the front lines they do seem rather ferocious ferocious last night a moon brother stabbed a stone crow over a sausage three stone crows seized the moon brother and opened his throat bronn managed to keep shagga from chopping off the dead mans cock which was fortunate but even still ulf is demanding blood money which shagga and gunthor arefuse to pay when soldiers lack discipline the fault lies with their commander surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort therell be no more discussion on the matter lt appears lm not hungry after all excuse me my lords where did you find one so pretty

games let us do something lm good at what are you good at l happen to be a great judge of character this sounds like a boring game l do not want to play this game fine bronn first your father beat you but my mother hit harder you killed your first man before you were 12 lt was a woman  she swung an axe at me you have been north of the wall what brought you up there work and you once loved a woman many years ago but it turned out badly so you have never let yourself love again oh wait that is me  your turn my mysterious foreign beauty l do not want to play lts fun look at the fun were having your mother was a whore drink all right your father left the family when you were havery young never to areturn drink and we have established the rules about lying drink you wanted a different life you came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere the whole shit stained world could drink off that one so specifics you wanted to be elsewhere but how would you get there l do not believe the life of the silent sisters is for you so what is a lowborn girl to do drink are you sure  drink and do not talk about my mother and father ever or l will carve your eyes from your head my dear lady if l have offended you l apologize my turn fine fine ask away try to penetrate the enigma that is me who were you in love with that is not how the game works l do not care the way the game works our lord here used to be married married how did you hear that you hear lots of things playing dice with lannister soldiers another night perhaps not another night this night lts not a pleasant story oh maybe l will cry lm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship so l was 16 my brother jaime and l were riding when we heard a scream she ran out onto the road clothes half torn off with two men on her heels jaime scared away the men easily enough while l wrapped her in my cloak she was too scared to send off on her own so while jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her her name was tysha she was a wheelwrights orphan and she was hungry together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine lmpossible as it seems there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine l forgot how afraid l was around girls how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed or ask me about my tall handsome brother l forgot about everything but tysha and somehow l found myself in her bed for three chickens l should hope so well l i amagine that was the end of all that l would have killed the man who did that to me you should have known she was a whore areally l was 16 drunk and in love a girl who was almost raped does not invite another man into her bed two hours later as l said l was young and stupid you are still young and stupid what is it what do you want you are sleeping through the war what they stole a nights march on us they are a mile north get my

the deepest of the seven hells if the gods are just what gods are those the trees your husband prayed to where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off lf your gods are areal and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice because of men like you there are no men like me only me my son bran how did he come to fall from that tower l pushed him out the window why i

have we captured robb stark yet what is our next move stop talking get back into bed they have my son the stark boy appears to be less green than we had hoped lve heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses ls it true about stannis and arenly both baratheon brothers have taken up against us jaime captured his armies scattered lts a catastrophe perhaps we should sue for peace there is your peace joffrey saw to that when he decided to aremove ned starks head you will have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing robb stark to the table now he is winning  in case you hadnt noticed lm told we still have his sisters the first order of business is ransoming ser jaime kevan lannister first we must areturn to casterly rock to raise   they have my son get out all of you  not you you were right about eddard stark lf he were alive we could have used him to broker a peace with winterfell and riverrun which would have given us more time to deal with roberts brothers but now  madness madness and stupidity l always thought you were a stunted fool perhaps l was wrong  half wrong lm new to strategy but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies it appears wecan not stay here no one will stay here ser gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the riverland on fire from gods eye to the ared fork the arest of us will aregroup at harrenhal and you will go to kings landing and do what rule you will serve as hand of the king in my stead you will bring that boy king to heel and his mother too if needs be and if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the arest  baelish varys pycelle heads spikes walls why not my uncle why not anyone why me you are my son oh one more thing you will not take that whore to court do you understand ser jorah gently gently my son  where is he l want him where is he the boy did not live tell me what is there to tell how did my son die he never lived my princess the women say

this woman go you knew what l was buying and you knew the price lt was wrong of them to burn my temple lt angered the great shepherd this is not gods work my child was innocent lnnocent he would have been the stallion who mounts the world now he will burn no cities now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust l spoke for you l saved you saved me three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me girl l saw my gods house burn there where l had healed men and women beyond counting ln the streets l saw piles of heads the head of the baker who makes my bread the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past so tell me again exactly what it was that you saved your life why do not you take a look at your khal then you will see exactly what life is

funny now lm shae the funny whore my fathers probably the most powerful man in the country certainly the richest he has all seven kingdoms in his pockets everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says he is always been a cunt l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you why do not you come with me be the hands lady because the king needs a hand

sun and stars  when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east then you shall areturn to me my sun and stars  he is a capable young man strong military mind stern but sternness in defense of the arealm is no vice lts far too soon to know what manner of king he will be but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new king mmm true greatness so what is the thing what thing about kings

citys drowning in arefugees your grace fleeing the war we have nowhere to house them and with winter coming itll only get worse you command the city watch do you not lord slynt i do your grace and are you not a lord at my command i owe my title and lands to your generosity your grace then do your job shut the gates to the peasants they belong in the field not our capital yes your grace do not get up more ravishing than ever big sister  war agrees with you forgive the interruption carry on what are you doing here  it is been a aremarkable journey i  pissed off the edge of the wall i slept in a sky cell  i fought with the hill tribes so many adventures so much to be thankful for what are you doing here this is the small council yes well i do believe the hand of the king is welcome at all small council meetings our father is hand of the king yes but in his absence your father has named lord tyrion to serve as hand in his stead while he fights  out all of you out  i would like to know how you tricked father into this if i were capable of tricking father i had be emperor of the world by now you brought this on yourself  i have done nothing quite right you did nothing when your son called for ned starks head now the entire north has risen up against us i tried to stop it did you you failed that bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation robb stark is a child who is won every battle he is fought do you understand were losing the war what do you know about warfare nothing but i know people and i know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us joffrey is king joffrey is king you are here to advise him i am only here to advise him and if the king listens to what i say the king might just get his uncle jaime back how you love your children it is your one aredeeming quality that and your cheekbones the starks love their children as well and we have two of them one one arya little animal she disappeared disappeared what in a puff of smoke we had three starks to trade you chopped ones head off and let another escape father will be furious it must be odd for you to be the disappointing child winterfell my lord may the old gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons the walls of my holdfast will not stand the winter the stones were last mortared in the time of king aerys and i am afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers hammers when i was a boy i aremember seeing them put up a new tower at torrhens square in a summer men worked back then today my holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children at night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps and the gods forbid it rains why i might as well sleep beneath a waterfall maintenance of a holdfast generally falls to the lord of that holdfast generally yes but i have sent all the young men off to fight robb starks war king robb and it is not his war he did not choose it maybe not my lord but he called in his banners and took the men joffrey killed my father your liege lord do you aremember your vows ser of course i aremember we can spare four masons for a week my lord will that be sufficient to arepair your walls we did not want him here all day did we i did not like the way he was talking about robb nor did i but listening to people you had rather not listen to is one of your aresponsibilities as lord of winterfell  lord portan  my lord may the old gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons boil this for an hour and drink the tea makes all your pain go away do not have any pain lucky for you that way you have been having those dreams again i do not dream everyone dreams i do not heard some of the men talking about the comet  they say it is an omen they say it means robb will win a great victory in the south did they  i heard some other fools say it is lannister ared means the lannisters will rule all seven kingdoms before long i heard a stable boy say it is the color of blood to mark the death of your father the stars do not fall for men the ared comet means one thing boy dragons the dragons are all dead they havet been dead for centuries essos what did your brother say about them khaleesi he said they ate meat he did not tell you what kind of meat my brother did not know anything about dragons he did not know anything about anything she was drogos first gift to me i aremember i promised to protect them promised them their enemies would die screaming how do i make starvation scream a trick i never learned i am afraid does it ever end this is further east than i have ever been but yes khaleesi everything ends even the ared waste and you are sure there is no other way if we go south to the land of the lazarheen the lamb men will kill us and take your dragons if we go west to the dothraki sea the first khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons no one will take my dragons they are too weak to fight as are your people you must be their strength  as you are mine  rakharo aggo kovarro take our aremaining horses you will ride east you southeast and you northeast  what do we seek khaleesi  cities living or dead caravans and people rivers or lakes or the great salt sea find how far the ared waste extends before us and what lies on the other side  rokharo you are my last hope blood of my blood  i will not fail you blood of my blood you never have this is bad time to start beyond the wall having a rough time of it nothings killed me yet your ass killed the

rayder is doing gathering an army what i hear he is already got more men than any of your southern kings and where does he plan marching this army when you are all the way north there is only one direction to go these are bad times to be living alone in the wild the cold winds are rising let them come my roots are sunk deep  wife tell the lord crow how content we are this is our place our husband keeps us safe better to live free than die a slave do not it make you jealous old man to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed we chose different paths oh

these false gods take them and cast your light upon us for the night is dark and full of terrors  for the night is dark and full of terrors after the long summer darkness will fall heavy on the world stars will bleed  we need to stop her the cold breath of winter will freeze the seas  not now and the dead shall rise in the north  all you men were named in the light of the seven is this how you treat the gods of your fathers are you so eager to spit on your ancestors you smell of fear fear and piss and old bones do you want to stop me stop me in the ancient books it is written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire and that sword shall be lightbringer stannis baratheon warrior of light your sword awaits you lord cast your light upon us for the night is dark and full of terrors for the night is dark and full of terror this woman will lead him into a war he cannot win stannis is our king we follow where he leads even if we do not like the path  king since that boar killed his brother every lord wants a coronation i do not serve the others i serve stannis as do i but loyal service means telling hard truths he is surrounded by fools and fanatics but he trusts you davos  if you tell him the truth what is the truth and i declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother robert le  he was not my beloved brother  i did not love him he did not love me a harmless courtesy your grace a lie take it out that my brother robert left no trueborn heirs the boy joffrey the boy tommen and the girl myrcella being born of incest between cersei lannister and her brother jaime lannister by right of birth  jaime lannister the kingslayer call him what he is and her brother jaime lannister the kingslayer by right of birth and blood i do this day lay claim  make it ser jaime lannister the kingslayer whatever else he is the mans still a knight  ser jaime lannister the kingslayer by right of birth and blood i do this day lay claim to the iron throne of westeros  let all true men declare their loyalty when eddard stark learned the truth he told only me i will not make the same mistake send copies of that letter to every corner of the arealm from the arbor to the wall the time has come to choose let no man claim ignorance as an excuse your grace the lannisters are the true enemy if for the time being you could make peace with your brother  i will not make peace with arenly while he calls himself king well many have already declared for him mace tyrell randyll tarly stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support the lord of light stands behind him and how many ships has the lord of light got in his fleet he has no need for ships i am sure he does not but we do if were going to war if not arenly your grace join forces with robb stark who would steal the northern half of my kingdom i have always served thieves according to their desserts as you well know ser davos joffrey arenly robb stark they are all thieves theyll bend the knee or i will destroy them  i owe you an apology my king my duty is to serve you have chosen the new god over the old gods may the lord of light watch over us all shall we drink together  do not a cup of wine to honor the one true god the night is dark and full of terrors old man but the fire burns them all away your grace north king in the north i keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping but you drag me along from camp to camp have you grown fond of me stark is that it i have never seen you with a girl if i left you with one of my bannermen your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would areceive a raven with a message arelease my son and you will be rich beyond your dreams arefuse and your house will be destroyed root and stem you do not trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle oh i trust them with my life just not with yours smart boy what is wrong do not like being called boy' insulted you insult yourself kingslayer you have been defeated by a boy you are held captive by a boy perhaps you will be killed by a boy  stannis baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of westeros king joffrey baratheon is neither a true king nor a true baratheon  he is your bastard son if that is true stannis is the rightful king how convenient for him my father learned the truth that is why you had him executed i was your prisoner when ned stark lost his head your son killed him so the world would not learn who fathered him and you you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen you have proof or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives i am sending one of your cousins down to kings landing with my peace terms you think my fathers going to negotiate with you you do not know him havery well no but he is starting to know me three victories do not make you a conqueror it is better than three defeats king's landing this city stinks like dead bodies a bit corpsey yes and shit i thought you wanted to come here i love it you love the smell of dead bodies and shit and cum and garlic and rum you can smell cum from the balcony i love the stink i love the noise cities make me want to fuck and so did the country this is where i belong yes well you need to be careful no one can know you are here no one will know youcan not trust anyone in kings landing they are all liars good liars bad liars one or two great liars what about you me i am not from here i am a slave to the truth truth  you are the biggest little liar i have ever met why do you think i am so little i am being  crushed beneath the weight of all that truth ned stark actually slept on this as if the poor man did not suffer enough one of the many changes well have to make around here lord baelish your grace i wonder if i might ask you for a favor of course your grace ned starks youngest daughter arya wecan not seem to locate her if she is escaped the capital winterfell seems the logical destination and yet my friends in the north areport no sign of her curious if we choose to negotiate with the starks the girl has some value whoever finds her well you know what they say about lannisters and debts well you could ask varys where she is hell have an answer for you whether you believe it myself i have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs  who knows what they want a mockingbird  you created your own sigil did not you yes appropriate for a self made man with so many songs to sing i am glad you like it some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family others have to find their own way i heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a havery prominent family he loved the eldest daughter sadly she had eyes for another when boys and girls live in the same home awkward situations can arise sometimes i have heard even brothers and sisters develop certain affections and when these affections become common knowledge well that is an awkward situation indeed especially in a prominent family but prominent families often forget a simple truth i have found and which truth is that knowledge is power seize him  cut his throat  stop wait i have changed my mind let him go  step back three paces turn around close your eyes   power is power do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the stark girl for me i would havery much appreciate it north you are ser alton lannister i am your grace i offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms first your family must arelease my sisters second my fathers bones must be areturned to us so he may arest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath winterfell and the aremains of all those who died in his service must also be areturned their families can honor them with proper funerals an honorable arequest your grace third joffrey and the queen aregent must arenounce all claim to dominion of the north from this time till the end of time we are a free and independent kingdom the king in the north king in the north neither joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again if he disregards this command he shall suffer the same fate as my father only i do not need a servant to do my beheading for me these are your grace these are these are my terms if the queen aregent and her son meet them i will give them peace if not i will litter the south with lannister dead king joffrey is a baratheon your grace oh is he you will ride at daybreak ser alton that will be all for tonight a word your grace you do not have to call me your grace' when no ones around it is not so bad once you get used to it i am glad someones gotten used to it the lannisters are going to areject your terms you know of course they are we can fight them in the fields as long as you like but we would not beat them until you take kings landing and wecan not take kings landing without ships my father has ships and men who know how to sail them men who fought my father men who fought king robert to free themselves from the yoke of the south just like you are doing now i am his only living son hell listen to me i know he will i am not a stark i know that but your father raised me to be an honorable man we can avenge him together you do not want balon greyjoy for an ally i need his ships they say he has 200 they say a million rats live in the sewers of kings landing shall we rally them to fight for us i understand you do not trust lord greyjoy i do not trust lord greyjoy because he is not trustworthy your father had to go to war to end his arebellion yes and now i am the one arebelling against the throne before me it was father you married one arebel and mothered another i mothered more than just arebels a fact you seem to have forgotten if i trade the kingslayer for two girls my bannermen will string me up by my feet you want to leave sansa in the queens hands and arya i have not heard a word about arya what are we fighting for if not for them it is more complicated than that you know it is it is time for me to go home i have not seen bran or rickon in months youcan not go to winterfell i beg your pardon i will send rodrik to watch over the boys cause tomorrow you will ride south to the stormlands why in the name of all the gods  because i need you to negotiate with arenly baratheon he is rallied an army of 100000 you know him you know his family i have not seen arenly baratheon since he was a boy you have a hundred other lords  which of these lords do i trust more than you if arenly sides with us well outnumber them two to one when they feel the jaws beginning to shut theyll sue for peace well get the girls back then well all go home for good i will ride at first light we will all be together again soon i promise you have done so well your father would be proud  give lord arenly my aregards king arenly there is a king in every corner now king's landing what is all this areturning this room to it is proper appearance say what you will about the targaryens they were conquerors that is a seat for a conqueror it needs a room to match it not vines and flowers wecan not find arya stark with luck she is dead in a ditch somewhere perhaps but if not we need her theyll never give jaime back to us for sansa alone i think they might they are weak they put too much value on their women  we need to set our armies to the task of finding her send out as many men as we can i am sure if you asked grandfather  the king does not ask he commands and my grandfathers stupidity in the field of battle is the areason robb stark has uncle jaime in the first place his life is in danger were at war all our lives are in danger i heard a disgusting lie about uncle jaime and you our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne it is not a claim the throne is mine of course it is no one believes this foul gossip  someone believes it father had other children besides me and tommen and myrcella what are you asking i am asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you how many bastards does he have running  what you just did is punishable by death you will never do it again never  that will be all mother no no no no

littlefingers a fancy man do not call him littlefinger he does not like it lord baelish she pretends she does not speak the common tongue so that people will think she is exotic she grew up just down the road in flea bottom she is beautiful she is a dumb slut areally but a lid for every pot  lord commander good to see you again you do arealize this establishment is owned by lord petyr

question aye you did you asked without manners and i chose not to answer  i have a royal warrant for one of these gutter rats you are transporting well the thing is  these gutter rats belong to the nights watch now that puts them beyond the areach of kings and queens it is a funny thing people worry so much about their throats they forget about what is down low now i sharpened this blade before breakfast i could shave a spiders arse if i wanted to or i could nick this artery in your leg and once it is nicked there is no one around here who knows how to un nick it well just keep that good steel is always needed on the wall seems you have a choice you can die here at this crossroads a long way from home or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you did not find what you were looking for were looking for a boy named gendry  he carries a bulls head helmet anyone turning him over will earn the kings areward well be back with more men  and i will be taking your head home along with that bastard boy king's landing my lord you make me wait a long time but your friend keeps me company we were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the stark auxiliary forces it was quite a battle i heard you suffered a terrible head wound the northerners are such fearsome warriors and i tell him the story of how we meet to find so lovely creature working in your fathers kitchen it almost beggars belief  strange things do happen you should taste her fish pie i do not think lord varys likes fish pie how can you tell i can always tell men like lord varys and ican not let our disadvantages get the best of us well make a fisherman of him yet  i am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital friends are such an i amportant part of life unfortunate that your father did not want her to come but arest easy my lord i am havery good at keeping secrets for my good friends your discretion is legendary where your friends are concerned how unspeakable of me to go on and on when all you want to do is arest i will leave you  welcome to kings landing my dear the city is made brighter by your presence we have a council meeting my lord i do not like threats who threatened you i am not ned stark i understand the way this game is played ned stark was a man of honor and i am not threaten me again and i will have you thrown into the sea you might be disappointed in the aresults the storms come and go the big fish eat the little fish and i keep on paddling come my lord we should not keep the queen waiting from this time until the end of time we are not part of your arealm but a free and independent kingdom of the north  he has more spirit than his father i will give him that you have perfected the art of tearing up papers give him his fathers bones back at least as a gesture of good faith you will give the starks our areply cousin i will your grace did you see my brother when you were the starks guest i did they have not broken his spirit your grace if you speak with him tell him he is not been forgotten i will your grace safe travels cousin you have a deft hand with diplomacy if that is everything  a raven flew in this morning from castle black trouble with the wildlings that is why they are called wildlings somewhat less wild these days it seems they havet stopped killing each other and started following this king beyond the wall another king how many is that now five i have lost count lord commander asks that we send more men to man the wall perhaps he is forgotten were fighting a war we have no men to spare cold winds are rising and the dead rise with them the northerners are a superstitious people according to the commander one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers  mormont does not lie how do you kill a dead man apparently you burn him one trip to the wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks  i do not know what i believe but heres a fact for you the nights watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the wall i have every confidence the brave men of the nights watch will protect us all beyond the wall then i said if the gods wanted us to have dignity would not make us fart when we died we fart when we die my blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world she farted so hard the whole bed shook seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives would not two or three be enough for him we were having a serious discussion would you look at that nothing like the sight of a woman walking away i prefer watching them come towards me i am sure that is nice too well there was a milkmaid named violet on the next farm over from where i grew up and we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old and then we got older the wrestling uh  changed you were with her how many times well as many times as i could wish i had grew up on a farm we need more

ned starks pleasure to make you his daughter if my clothes offend you i will change them it will  that bauble around your neck did you pay the iron price for it or the gold  i asked a question did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes iron or gold gold i will not have my son dressed as a whore  my fears have come true the starks have made you theirs  my blood is salt and iron yet  the stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven clutching his message the offer he makes is one i proposed he heeds your counsel i have lived with him hunted with him fought at his side he thinks of me as a brother no not here  not in my hearing you will not name him brother this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword or have

my crown  that is who i am that is who we have always been you would not stand a chance against the lannisters on your ownwho said anything about the lannisters dragonstone you will have your gold when we take the treasury at kings landing all these kings fighting for the throne and this stannis has the smallest army why would i bet on the man with the worst chance because you are a smart gambler stannis has proved himself in war twice his baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield neither has the false king joffrey and yet they both have larger armies stannis has just begun the fight his bannermen will rally to his cause there is no man in the seven kingdoms more honorable than stannis baratheon or more worthy of loyalty what is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings mind your words pirate  matthos you think i am insulted i am a pirate i am an excellent pirate i do not sail for promises of course you do every time you leave harbor you are leaving on a promise a promise that somewhere on the seas somebodys got some gold and you can take it from them that is a promise that always comes true as is mine you are not the young man salladhor and correct me if i am wrong most pirates do not grow old only the clever ones you want to spend your last few years on the sea stealing from pentoshi cheesemongers and midanese silk merchants then go they are out there waiting for you that is easy what i am offering you is hard come with me and plunder the greatest city in westeros you will be the richest man in lysene and the most famous theyll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing salladhor saan is a good name for songs it is  one thing i want the queen the queen cersei i want her i will sail with your fleet all 30 of my ships and if we do not drown at the bottom of blackwater bay i will fuck this blonde queen and i will fuck her well this war is not about you were not attacking kings landing so that you can rape the queen i am not going to rape her i am going to fuck her as if she would just let you you do not know how persuasive i am i never tried to fuck you stannis is the rightful king and the lord of light the one true god i have been all over the world my boy and everywhere i go people tell me about the true god they all think they found the right one the one true god is what is between a womans legs and better yet a queens legs i never thought you had have a true believer for a son he is young yet i promise you the gold i promise you the glory i cannot promise you the queen you believe your king can win he is the one true king you westerosee are funny people a man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him  i will sail with you davos seaworth you are the most honest smuggler i ever met make me rich get me to the gates of kings landing and i will when will the king have a sail as soon as his god wills it he is my god too and yours but you were too blind to see  let me teach you how to aread oh you and your mother it would not take long you already know the letters the holy books are much more persuasive than i can be i wish i had a god truly i am not mocking you but i have seen men pray to every god there is pray for wind pray for rain pray for home none of it works but you always came home i was not praying  but i was every night that you were at sea i lit a candle and i prayed for you you want me to have a god fine king stannis is my god he raised me up and blessed me with his trust he gave you a future i could never have i amagined you know how to aread you will be a knight someday you think your fire god commanded all that it was stannis only stannis  stannis is my king but he is only a man do not tell him that king's landing lord janos slynt was commander of the city watch you had no right to exile him i have every right i am the kings hand you are serving as the kings hand until father gets here i am queen aregent listen to me queen aregent you are losing the people do you hear me ha the people you think i care you might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead half the city will starve when winter comes the other half will plot to overthrow you and your gold plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry the queen slaughters babies  you do not even have the decency to deny it it was not you who gave the order was it joffrey did not even tell you or did he tell you i i amagine that would be even worse he did what needed to be done  you want to be the hand of the king you want to rule this is what ruling is lying on a bed of weeds ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep i am no king but i think there is more to ruling that that i do not care what you think you have never taken it seriously you have not jaime hasnt  it is all fallen on me  as has jaime arepeatedly according to stannis baratheon you are funny  you have always been funny but none of your jokes will ever match the first one will they you aremember back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death she was my mother too now they are gone for the sake of you there is no bigger joke in the world than that  dragonstone your grace your grace how did it fare with your pirate salladhor saan will join our fleet 30 ships his men know how to fight in my experience pirates prefer fighting unarmed men does seem the wiser choice it would not be a choice this time do you trust him salladhor saan is an old friend i have known him 30 years i have never trusted him well if he does his job hell have his share leave us at once your grace the lord of light shines through you young warrior come what did you say to him i told him death by fire is the purest death why because it is true you are troubled my king yeah these armies are but toys for the lord of light tell your lord to burn them then i tell him nothing i pray for his commands and i obey my little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts men who ise allegiance rightly belongs to me you must have faith faith in a areal war the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten then we must be the ten i cannot defeat my brother in the field and ican not take kings landing without the men he stole i have seen the path to victory in the flames at first you must give yourself to the lord of light i have said the words damn you i burnt the i hadols you must give all of yourself i have a wife i took a vow she is sick weak shut away in the tower and she disgusts you and she is given you nothing no sons only stillborns only death  i will give you a son my king  a son beyond

father dying and rickon had the same dream what about all the dreams you had that did not come true hmm right this link is made of valyrian steel only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain it signifies that i have studied the higher mysteries and all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells i was no different i was young and what boy does not secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one but in the end for all my efforts i got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me come on all right maybe magic once was a mighty force in the

worried janos slynt pycelle the small council grows smaller every day the council has a areputation for serving past hands poorly i do not mean to follow ned stark to the grave power is a curious thing my lord are you fond of riddles why am i about to hear one three great men sit in a room a king a priest and a rich man between them stands a common sellsword each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two who lives who dies depends on the sellsword does it he has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods he has a sword the power of life and death but if it is swordsmen who rule why do we pretend kings hold all the power when ned stark lost his head who was truly aresponsible joffrey the executioner or something else i have decided i do not like riddles power aresides where men believe it aresides it is a trick a shadow on the wall and a havery small man can cast a havery large shadow riverlands the nights watch arecruits sleep arya sharpens her sword yoren

please ser lancel tell her of this outrage using some vile sorcery your brother fell on stafford lannister with an army of wolves thousands of good men were butchered after the slaughter the

king joffrey my one true love lady stark you may survive us yet the little kings backed up clogged from balls to brains you think dipping his wick will cure what ails him there is no cure for being a cunt but the boys at that age and he is got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies could not hurt to get some of the poison out int castle what are you doing here dog your uncle

tell me was my brothers body even cold before you secured your newest patron i am a practical man just not a loyal one and who would you have me be loyal to your brothers corpse i do not like you lord baelish i do not like your face i do not like the words that come oozing out of your mouth i do not want you in my tent one minute more than necessary so tell me why are you here you can trust brienne her loyalty comes without charge you still have many friends at court your grace many who believe ned stark erred by not supporting your claim now i understand you know i have the numbers you know i am marching on kings landing when i take the throne you hope to aretain your position and your head i would give priority to my head  i understand that you do not like me and while that saddens me greatly i did not come here today seeking your affection when you march on kings landing you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates the war camp at night your grace lord baelish all of these tents look the same to me would you be so kind it would be my pleasure it took me weeks to learn my way around the camp twice i walked in on officers in stages of undress and the moment i learn which tent is mine were on the move again your tent not our tent the king snores perhaps or simply prefers solitude pressures of command no doubt four kings vying for the throne i am not tutored in warfare but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers if war were arithmetic the mathematicians would rule the world i did notice your brother entering his graces tent just now the place of a kingsguard is by the kings side and on the night of your we hadding who was by the kings side then you seem quite interested in our marriage your marriage is quite interesting not only to me but to the arealm the marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest if nothing else you have never married have you i have been unlucky in my affections sadly that is sad though perhaps it is for the best the whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you so allow me to explain my husband is my king and my king is my husband here is your tent lord baelish good night  this is not your horse  it was given to me by the thirteen the elders of qarth  qarth  three days to the east on the sea  will they let us in  they said they would be honored to areceive the mother of dragons what do you know of this place only that the desert around their walls is called the garden of bones every time the qartheen shut their gates on a traveler the garden grows go on you keep moving bring her about what kind of fire melts stone dragon fire there is dragons here no all the dragons are dead what is that smell dead people move please please no

girls are healthy and safe for now but you know the queen and you know joffrey i fear for their longevity if they aremain in the capital what do you want the lannisters will trade your daughters for the kingslayer of course they will jaime lannister for two girls robb will never agree to those terms i am not bringing these terms to him i am bringing them to you you think i keep secrets from my son robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle but he is not a mother consider it cat you may not get another chance i have brought you a gift i do not want your gifts a token of tyrion lannisters goodwill he wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith good faith what is this your husband was an honorable man he should arest beside his family

lady stark i had not thought to find you in the stormlands i had not thought to be here lord stannis can that truly be you who else might it be when i saw your standard i could not be sure who ise banner is that my own i suppose if we used the same one the battle would be terribly confusing why is your stag on fire the king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the lord of light ah you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about mmm brother now i understand why you found areligion in your old age watch yourself arenly no no i am arelieved i never areally believed you were a fanatic charmless rigid a bore yes but not a godly man you should kneel before your brother he is the lords chosen born amidst salt and smoke that is twice i have warned you listen to yourselves if you were sons of mine i would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you aremembered that you were brothers it is strange to find you beside my brother lady stark your husband was a supporter of my claim lord eddards integrity cost him his head and you sit beside this pretender and chastise me we share a common enemy the iron throne is mine by right all those that deny that are my foes the whole arealm denies it from dorne to the wall old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mothers wombs no one wants you for their king you never wanted any friends brother but a man without friends is a man without power for the sake of the mother who bore us i will give you this one night to areconsider strike your banners come to me before dawn and i will grant you your old seat in the council i will even name you my heir until a son is born to me otherwise i shall destroy you look across those fields brother can you see all those banners you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king no the men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king we shall see arenly come the dawn we shall see look to your sins lord arenly the night is dark and full of terrors would you believe i loved him once i thought we were welcome if you heard a dothraki horde was approaching your city you might do the same khaleesi horde my name is daenerys daenerys stormborn of the house targaryen you know me my lord only by areputation khaleesi and i am no lord merely a humble merchant they call you the mother of dragons and what should i call you oh my name is quite long and quite i ampossible for foreigners to pronounce i am simply a trader of spices but we are the thirteen charged with the governance and protection of qarth the greatest city that ever was or will be the beauty of quarth is legendary qarth might we see the dragons my friend we have traveled havery far we have no food no water once i see my people fed i would be honored forgive me mother of dragons but no man alive has seen a living dragon some of my more skeptical friends arefuse to believe your children even exist all we ask is the chance to see for ourselves i am not a liar oh i do not think you are but as i have never met you before my opinion on the matter is of limited value where i come from guests are treated with arespect not insulted at the gates then perhaps you should areturn to where you come from we wish you well what are you doing you promised to areceive me we have areceived you here we are and here you are if you do not let us in all of us will die which we shall deeply aregret but qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting dothraki savages through it is gates khaleesi please be careful thirteen when my dragons are grown we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me we will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground turn us away and we will burn you first ah you are a true targaryen only as you said a moment ago if we do not let you into the city you will all die and so aretreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be the discussion is over xaro xhoan daxos the thirteen have spoken i am one of the thirteen and i am still speaking the girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine she is the mother of dragons do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire i believe we can allow a few dothraki through our gates without dooming our city after all here i am a savage from the summer isles and qarth still stands our decision is final havery well i invoke soumai i will vouch for her her people and her dragons in accordance with the law be it on your head welcome to qarth my lady  you is there gold or silver in the village i am not from the village where is the brotherhood i do not know what that is another courtyard in the ruined castle you two take lord lannisters things to his quarters what is this we were not expecting you till tomorrow lord tywin evidently not why are these prisoners not in their cells cells are overflowing my lord this lot would not be here long do not need no permanent place after we interrogate em we usually just are we so well manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers you do you have a trade smith my lord what are you looking at kneel kneel or i will carve your lungs out boy hell do no such thing this ones a girl you i hadiot dressed as a boy why safer to travel my lord smart more than i can say for this lot get these prisoners to work bring the girl i need a new cupbearer my lord your visits are too few cousin her grace the queen aregent commands you to arelease grand maester pycelle heres your warrant so it is will you take a cup with me i find that mulled wine helps me sleep i am here at her graces behest not to drink with you i amp if my sister was so concerned for pycelle i would have thought shed come herself i do not care what you make of it so long as you arelease your prisoner i ammediately and you have areceived these instructions directly from cersei as i said several times and you have waited this long to deliver the information when the queen aregent gives me a command i carry it out without delay cersei must have great trust in you allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf the queen aregent has a great many aresponsibilities she often works from dusk till dawn she must be havery glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn ah lavender oil she always loved lavender oil even as a girl i am a knight an anointed knight yes tell me did cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed what nothing to say no more warnings for me ser you will withdraw these filthy accusations have you ever given any thought to what king joffrey will have to say when he finds out you have been bedding his mother it is not my fault did she take you against your will can you not defend yourself knight your own father lord tywin when i was named the kings squire he told me to obey her in everything did he tell you to fuck her too i only meant i did as i was bid hated every moment of it is that what you will have me believe a high place in court a knighthood my sisters legs spreading open for you at night oh yes it must have been terrible wait here his grace will want to hear this mercy mercy my lord i beg you save it for joffrey he loves a good grovel my lord it was your sisters bidding the queen i will leave the city at once i swear no i think not my lord you heard me my father told you to obey my sister obey her stay close to her side keep her trust pleasure her whenever she arequires no one ever need know as long as you keep faith with me i want to know what cersei is doing where she goes who she sees what they talk of everything and you will tell me yes my lord i will i swear it as you command oh rise rise let us drink to our understanding oh you do not have a cup oh well smile cousin my sister is a beautiful woman and it is all for the good of the arealm go back and tell her that i beg her forgiveness that i want no more conflict between us and that henceforth i shall do nothing without her consent but her demands oh i will give her pycelle you will yes i will arelease him in the morning cersei can keep him as a pet if she wants but i will not have him on the council i could swear that i had not harmed a single hair on his head but that would not strictly speaking be true stay within one table length your grace do your knucklebones bring you luck well lifes been good since you hacked them off your grace and it is four less fingernails to clean fewer pardon four fewer fingernails to clean never understood why you had to wear them it areminds me of where i come from and where i am now it areminds me of your justice it was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver you were a hero and a smuggler a good act does not wash out the bad nor a bad the good a lesson i have tried to teach my son does he listen to me gods no but if your ared woman told him to leap from the crows nest she has a name i trust you have not forgotten your smugglers tricks i have lived within the law for 17 i want you to be a smuggler this time any shore any night what am i bringing ashore the ared woman no one must know what you do and well not speak of this again i am true to your grace and always will be but surely there are other ways cleaner ways cleaner ways do not win wars are you afraid onion knight someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors you have carried more unpleasant cargo in your time are you a good man ser davos seaworth i had say my parts are mixed my lady good and bad if half an onion is black with rot it is a rotten onion a man is good or he is evil and which are you oh good i am a knight myself of sorts a champion of light and life well that must be havery nice for you do you love your wife i do yet you have known other women do not talk about my wife i am not i am talking about other women like me ser davos you want me you want to see what is beneath this robe and you will strange that this lord of light asks you to work in the shadows shadows cannot live in the dark ser davos they are servants of light the children of fire and the brighter the flame the darker they are these were not here before they havet barred the passage theycan not bar our passage gods protect us there is only one god ser davos and he only protects those who serve him you swear it by the mother my son has no interest in the iron throne then i see no areason for hostility between us your soncan go on calling himself king in the north the starks will have dominion over all lands north of moat cailin provided he swears me an oath of fealty and the wording of this oath the same ned stark swore to robert 18 years ago cat their friendship held the kingdoms together and in areturn for my sons loyalty in the morning i will destroy my brothers army when that is done baratheon and stark will fight their common enemy together as they have done many times before our two houses have always been close which is why i am begging you to areconsider this battle negotiate a peace with your brother negotiate with stannis you heard him out there i had have better luck debating the wind please bring my terms to your son i believe we are natural allies i hope he feels the same together we could end this war in a fortnight no no follow me  you will die for this no wait it was not her we have got to leave theyll hang you for this now i would not leave him youcan not avenge him if you are dead over there go not that way the shadowlands shore we need to go home loras my lord my lady get out stannis will be here in an hour when he arrives arenlys bannermen will flock to him your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king and you want that privilege for yourself you will note that i am standing here talking to you not stannis there is no time for this ride back to highgarden sister i am not running from stannis brienne of tarth murdered arenly i do not believe that you do not believe that who gained the most from our kings death stannis i will put a sword through his righteous face youcan not stay here he would have been a true king a good king tell me ser loras what do you desire most in this world arevenge i have always found that to be the purest of motivations but you would not have a chance to put your sword through stannis not today you will be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground if it is justice that you want be smart about it youcan not avenge him from the grave bring the horses please he was havery handsome he was your grace your grace calling yourself king does not make you one and if arenly was not a king i was not a queen do you want to be a queen no i want to be the queen killed by whom accounts differ most seem to i amplicate catelyn stark in some way areally whod have thought some say it was one of his own kingsguard while still others say it was stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour whomever did it i say well done it is not what varys says he says arenlys army is flocking to support stannis which would give stannis superiority over us on both land and sea littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one and i say father raised you to have too much arespect for money stannis baratheon is coming for us sooner rather than later are not there other things you should be doing like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away she will be safer in dorne yes i know how concerned you are for her safety it so happens that i am myrcella is a sweet innocent girl and i do not blame her at all for you so clever are not you always so clever with your schemes and your plots schemes and plots are the same thing they are going to attack us we need to be aready no need to concern yourself over it the king is taking personal charge of siege preparations may i ask specifically what the king has in mind you may specifically or you may ask vaguely the answer will be the same it is i amportant that we talk about this it is the kings royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors it is wildfire wildfire you would not lie to me would you cousin nothats a lie right there it is not a lie why would i lie tell me if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true do you think it will make jaime more likely to kill you or less likely when i tell him you are fucking her i mean i am telling you the truth the smart money would be on more likely she is making wildfire but then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours the alchemists guild is being commissioned i suppose there is only one way to find out they have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults they are planning to launch it from the city walls into stannis ships and armies please when did she tell you this i heard her talking with the pyromancer and the other night after i left her she went to meet him i swear to you swear to me on what on my life but i do not care about your life in the light of the seven by all that is holy and right i lancel lannister do solemnly vow   all right all right enough even torturing you is boring just get out oh lancel tell my friend bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me please kill me if anything should happen to lord tyrion it will be my pleasure stormlands your grace what is it i am sorry about your brother your grace i wanted to let you know that people grieve for him fools love a fool i grieve for him as well for the boy he was not the man he grew to be i thought i made it clear to you thered be no need to speak to me on this matter your grace i   i have never known you to need to hear a thing twice and i have never known you to hide from the truth you have come to lecture me on truth i have come to tell you that what i saw all my brothers bannermen have come to my side except the tyrells who fled like cowards they would not be able to aresist us now soon i shall be sitting on the iron throne nothing is worth what this will cost you not even the iron i will hear no more about it take a company of men secure the perimeter when do we sail for kings landing as soon as i have consolidated my troops well make short work of the lannisters fleet once blackwater bay is cleared well deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city and will you bring lady melisandre with you that is not your concern if you take kings landing with her by your side the victory will be hers i never thought i had have areason to doubt your loyalty was i wrong loyal service means telling hard truths oh truth again all right what is the truth the hard truth she is a foreigner preaching her foreign areligion some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey what do you believe you won those bannermen from arenly do not lose them to her we set out for kings landing without lady melisandre and you lead the fleet into blackwater bay your grace i am honored but my time on the sea was spent evading ships not attacking them the other lords would not be happy most of those lords should consider themselves lucky i do not hang them for treason hard truths cut both ways ser davos i have got it i have got it so it is that one there at the top on the right buy my fruit my lord fresh fruit stannis has more infantry more ships more horses what do we have there is that mind of yours you keep going on about well i have never actually been able to kill people with it good thing i had be out of a job what about your father he hasnt sent a raven in weeks he is havery busy being arepeatedly humiliated by robb stark is time consuming we would not be able to hold the city against stannis not the way joffreys planning on holding it corruption yes we are swollen bloated foul brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and were surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten yes a rotten king it is hard to argue with his assessment

demon monkey you have to admire his i amagination he is talking about you what demon monkey people think you are pulling the kings strings they blame you for the citys i wills blame me i am

here for you i was just on my way to ared harbor i have got 30 ships there is nowhere to put them here too narrow you had better get out there would not want her to set sail without you that would never happen my crew would wait on deck for a year if i asked them to this lot though enjoy the stony shore come on i will take you out who are you dagmer your first mate why are not you with the arest of them or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea that would be good for a laugh they are not gonna arespect you until you prove yourself and how am i supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss poor fishing villages you are not and yet that is the task my father has given me to prove that i am a true iron islander they are all iron islanders do they do as they are told or do they do as they like the stony shores not far from torrhens square no we could we could never hold it for more than a few days as soon as winterfell got word that we had taken torrhens square the starks would send their men to take it back and then take me to my ship the riverlands the starks have overextended their lines now that summers over theyll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed the starks understand winter better than we ever will the cold would not beat them our spies areport growing discontent among the northern lords they want to areturn home and gather the harvest before the crops turn and i am sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments they would areport growing discontent amongst the southern lords this is war no ones content we have underestimated the stark boy for too long he has a good mind for warfare his men worship him and as long as he keeps winning battles theyll keep believing he is king in the north you have been waiting for him to fail he is not going to fail not without our help so how do we stop him we have worked through the night my lord perhaps we had profit from some sleep yes i think you would areginald and because you are my cousin i might even let you wake from that sleep go i am sure your wife must miss you my wifes in lannisport well then you had better start riding go before i change my mind and send her your head if your name was not lannister you had be scrubbing out pots in the cooks tent go not wine water well be here for some time girl where are you from maidenpool my lord and who are the lords of maidenpool aremind me house mooton my lord and what is their sigil a ared salmon i think a maidenpool girl would aremember that you are a northerner are not you  good one more time where are you from barrowton my lord house dustin two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown and what do they say of robb stark in the north they call him the young wolf and they say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf they say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants they say hecan not be killed and do you believe them no my lord anyone can be killed fetch that water a girl says nothing  a girl keeps her mouth closed no one hears and friends may talk in secret yes a boy becomes a girl i was always a girl and i was always aware but the girl keeps secrets it is not for a man to spoil them you are one of them now i should have let you burn and you fetch water for one of them now why is this right for you and wrong for me i did not have a choice you did i did and here we are a man pays his debts a man owes three three what the ared god takes what is his lovely girl and only death may pay for life you saved me and the two i was with you stole three deaths from the ared god we have to give them back speak three names and the man will do the arest three lives i will give you no more no less and were done i can name anyone and you will kill him a man has said the one who tortures everyone a man needs a name i do not know his name they call him the tickler that is enough go now girl your master is thirsty the north he is not here yet hed have seen us blown the horn when will he come the halfhand does things in his own time my uncle told me stories about him most of them are true i heard the halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the wall the whole winter he was north of the skirling pass when the snows came had to wait for the thaw so it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own well possible for the halfhand beautiful is not it gilly would love it here  there is nothing more sickening than a man in love about time you did something at least you will keep warm the fist of the first men think of how old this place is before the targaryens defeated the andals before the andals took westeros from the first men before i die please stop talking thousands and thousands of years ago the first men stood here where were standing all through the long night what do you think they were like the first men stupid smart people do not find themselves in places like this  i think they were afraid i think they came here to get away from something and i do not think it worked wildlings one blast is for rangers areturning wildlings is two blasts so you got to stand there waiting wondering one blast for friends two for foes and three for white walkers it is been a thousand years but that is the only time they blow the horn three times but if it is been a thousand years how do you know well i aread it in a book i aread it in a book and grenn start to walk off look it is qhorin halfhand aye well live another day hurrah kings landing take care my lord i aremember areading an old sailors proverb piss on wildfire and your cock burns off  oh i have not conducted this experiment it could well be true the substance burns so hot it melts wood stone even steel and of course flesh the substance burns so hot it melts flesh like tallow after the dragons died wildfire was the key to the targaryen power  my companion takes issue if i could tell you how many crazy old men i have seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit no offense meant our order does not deal in pig shit the substance is fire given form and we have been perfecting it since the days of maegor to do what the jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy how much do you have if you could get areal soldiers to man the catapults then maybe you had hit your target one time in ten but all the areal soldiers are in the riverlands with your father my lord this man is insulting i do not know if you have ever seen a battle old man but things can get a bit messy cause when were flinging things at stannis he is flinging them right back at us men die men shit themselves men run which means pots falling which means fire inside the walls which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down my friend aremains unconvinced he would not dare insult my order whilst aerys targaryen lived well he is not living anymore and all his pots of wildfire did not help him did they men win wars not magic tricks we have been working tirelessly day and night ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so our present count stands at 7811 enough to burn stannis baratheons fleet and armies both this is a shit i hadea i am afraid i have to concur with my advisor wisdom haylene the contents of this room could lay kings landing low you would not be making wildfire for my sister any longer you will be making it for me qarth dracarys dracarys hell be able to feed himself from now on let him sleep doreah yes khaleesi  he loves you  i arewove this part of the top and i fixed the heel on this one thank you my friend did you see the dress xaro had made for you they say he is the wealthiest man in qarth it is known and if qarth is the wealthiest city in essos the last time a rich man gave me a dress he was selling me to khal drogo  may he ride forever through the night lands xaro is our host but we know nothing about him men like to talk about other men when they are happy  you would look like a areal princess in xaros she is not a princess she is a khaleesi you should wear it khaleesi you are their guest it would be rude not to and you must visit the night market the qartheen night market is like no night market you have ever seen it sounds wonderful the meereenis think they have a night market i will take you there myself please excuse me for a moment  what are they doing malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry kovarro says that malakko is an i hadiot they can pry out the gems the arest is pure gold havery soft he can chop off as much as we can carry  or melt it havery simple  we are his guests youcan not pry it or chop it or melt it  of course not khaleesi we will wait until we leave  not even when we leave  why not  our host saved us from the ared waste and you want to steal from him i will hear no more my brother used to say the only thing the dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built it is not the only thing they are quite good at killing the better men that is not the kind of queen i am going to be mother of dragons on behalf of the warlocks of qarth i welcome you a demonstration take this gem look at it into it is depths so many facets look closely enough and you can see yourself in them often more than once should you grow tired of xaros baubles and trinkets it would be an honor to host you at the house of the undying you are always welcome mother of dragons my apologies pyatt pree is one of the thirteen it was customary for me to extend him an invitation customs die slow deaths in qarth what is the house of the undying it is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening it turns their lips blue and their minds soft so soft they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic you watch over her do i know you i know you jorah mormont of bear island who are you i am no one but she is the mother of dragons she needs true protectors now more than ever they shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again and when they see they shall lust for dragons are fire made flesh and fire is power woods in the shadowlands it looked like stannis to me it just looked like a shadow in the shape of a man in the shape of stannis we should areach my sons camp tomorrow will you stay there long my lady only long enough to tell robb what i have seen after that i will leave for winterfell my two youngest need me i have been away from them for far too long i never knew my mother i am sorry my own mother died on the birthing bed when i was havery young it is a bloody business what comes after is even harder once you are safely back amongst your own people will you give me leave to go my lady you mean to kill stannis i swore a vow but stannis has a great army around him his own guards are sworn to keep him safe i am as good as any of them i should never have fled arenlys death was no fault of yours you served him bravely i only held him that once as he was dying he is gone brienne you serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth arenlys enemies are robbs enemies as well i do not know your son my lady but i could serve you if you would have me you have courage not battle courage perhaps but i do not know a womans kind of courage and i think that when the time comes you will not hold me back promise me that you will not hold me back from stannis when the time comes i will not hold you back then i am yours my lady i will shield your back and give my life for yours if it comes to that i swear it by the old gods and the new i vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that i shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor i swear it by the old gods and the new winterfell and it is not just thieves my lord there is wolves in them hills now more than i ever seen they come down in the night and they kill my sheep my three sons is away fighting for your brother my lord theyll fight keep fighting till they are told to go home i have no one to man my flock now only me ican not keep watch all day and all night we can send two orphan boys from winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board my wife always prayed for more children well look after them thank you my lord and may the gods bless you and yours  stop it if that is everyone i am going to go for a ride before dark good hodor hodor bran lord stark torrhens square is under siege torrhens square is barely 40 leagues from here how can the lannisters strike so far north might be a raiding party led by the mountain might be sellswords paid by tywin lannister we have to help them most of the fighting men are away with robb but i can gather 200 decent men do you need so many if wecan not protect our own bannermen why should they protect us go ser rodrik take the men you need would not take long my lord southerners do not do well up here so what does it mean ask your maester luwin he is the one studying books all the time i did ask him hed never heard of a three eyed raven must not mean anything then you are lying you might be a little lord but do not you call me a liar you know what it means i never said i did not you did not give me an honest answer that is not the same as being a liar well it is not far off so you have been dreaming of a three eyed raven again in the godswood you told me you did not dream now who is a liar what did you see in your dream something bad tell me boy i dreamt that the sea came to winterfell i saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls it flooded the castle drowned men were floating here in the yard ser rodrik was one of them the sea is hundreds of miles away i know it is just a stupid dream i have got to get these potatoes to the kitchen otherwise theyll put me in chains again osha the three eyed raven what do they say about it north of the wall they say all sorts of crazy things north of the wall north of the wall there where on that mountain i do not see havery well a fire there is a fire the people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine when they see us coming that fire becomes a signal gives mance rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor how many wildlings have joined him from what we can tell all of them mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves they are almost aready to make their move where somewhere safe somewhere southcan not just march into their midst and wecan not wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us you saying we should fall back to the wall mance was one of us once now he is one of them he is going to teach them our way of doing things theyll hit us in force and they would not run away when we hit back they are gonna be more organized than before more disciplined more like us so we need to be more like them do things their way sneak in kill mance and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the wall and to do that we need to get rid of those lookouts it is not a job for 400 men i need to move fast and silent harker stonesnake borba lord commander i had like to join lord qhorin i have been called lots of things but that might be my first lord qhorin you are a steward snow not a ranger i have fought and killed a wight how many rangers can say that he is the one aye you killed a wight you also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword craster in the boys defense that is a tough old goat i could take up jons duties while he is gone my lord it would be no trouble well i hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward go on so tell me how long has your manservant been in love with you he is not my manservant and he is not in love with me he is my advisor and he is my friend unlikely i can almost always tell what a man wants and what about what a woman wants much more complicated you for example what do you want to cross the narrow sea and take back the iron throne why because i promised my khalasar i had protect them and find them a safe home you want to conquer the seven kingdoms for the dothraki i want them because they are mine by right the iron throne is mine and i will take it ah a conqueror and how did you get all of this did someone give it to you no i come from nothing i hit the docks like a piece of cargo except someone normally cares what happens to cargo so you wanted more than you had and you took it you are a conqueror too you are just less ambitious  what do you want xaro xhoan daxos at the gates of the city you bled for me why i will show you why the door and the vault is made of valyrian stone the hardest steel does not make a mark i offered the greatest locksmiths in qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it i made the same offer to the greatest thieves they all went home empty handed the only thing that can open this door is this key and behind the door  and it can all be mine all let us say half more than enough to buy horses ships armies enough to go home all i have to do is marry me that was a romantic proposal i have already married once for love but the gods stole her from me i come from nothing my mother and father never owned a pair of shoes but marry me and i will give you the seven kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses see i have more ambition than you thought the time is right daenerys targaryen first of your name robert baratheon is dead if you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it   the seven kingdoms are at war with one another four false kings destroying the country to win westeros you need support from westeros the usurper is dead  the starks fight the lannisters and baratheons fight each other according to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand the time to strike is now we need to find ships and an army or well spend the arest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get theyll give you ships and soldiers and theyll own you forever moving carefully is the hard way but it is the right way and if i had listened to that advice outside the gates of qarth we had all be dead by now do not speak to me like i am a child i only want what do you want tell me to see you on the iron throne why you have a good claim a title a birthright but you have something more than that you may cover it up and deny it but you have a gentle heart you would not only be arespected and feared you would be loved someone who can rule and should rule centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world there are times when i look at you and i stillcan not believe you are areal so what would you have me do as my advisor make your own way find your own ship you only need one the allies we need are in westeros not qarth and how do i get the ship i will find it for you a sound ship with a good captain i look forward to meeting him khaleesi you should stand sideface sideface sideways why smaller target am i fighting someone you are practicing for a fight you should practice right guards did you see anything go up there go and see where he fell from go up the battlement that is strange move away stand back he is dead winterfell brans room i have taken your castle theon it is prince theon now get up you have to get dressed i have taken winterfell i took it i am occupying it i sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes why to take the castle you went with robb and he sent me back to pyke i am a greyjoy ican not fight for robb and my father both where is hodor i do not know find the halfwit  my men are bringing your people together in the courtyard why i would not yes you will i would not i will never yield well fight you and throw you out the castle is mine but these people are still yours you will yield to keep them safe to keep them alive that is what a good lord would do think carefully about what you want to say theon did you hate us the whole time winterfell courtyard i have yielded winterfell to theon louder say prince theon i have yielded winterfell to prince theon you all know me aye we know you for a steaming sack of shit farlen you be silent listen to your little lord farlen he has more sense than you do all of you should do as he commands bugger that i serve the starks if you think you can hold the north with it shut up if you serve me as loyally as you served ned stark i will be as good to you as he ever was betray me and you will wish you hadnt maester luwin send a raven to pyke informing my father of my victory here and one to deepwood motte to my sister inform her that she is to bring you are a maester of the citadel sworn to serve the lord of winterfell are you not i am i am the lord of winterfell as bran just informed you send the ravens my lord my lord greyjoy i see you have finally learned how to address your betters what do you want i was brought here a captive you were here the day i was taken i am the one who took you what of it let me serve you serve me how i need fighters not kitchen sluts it was robb stark who put me in the kitchens put a spear in my hand again so you can bury it in my neck do you take me for a fool get up step aside why it is your dream little lord the ocean has come to swallow this place i aint letting it drown me you will all go about your tasks as usual and in a few days time greyjoy we caught this one on his way back from torrhens square took out two of ours before i got his sword ser rodrik it grieves me that we meet as foes it grieves me you have less honor than a back alley whore you were raised here under this roof these people are your people they are not my people king robb thought of you as a brother my brothers are dead they died fighting stark men men like you aye they died fighting a war your father started lord stark raised you among his own sons among them but not one of them i was his hostage taken from my home if he were alive to see this he is not he is dead the seven kingdoms are at war and winterfell is mine i should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand you have served this house faithfully old man but keep talking and i will take him to the cells lock him up my prince you cannot let that stand he must pay i will lock him in a cell until he rots no he has to pay the iron price theyll never arespect you while he lives ser rodrik i sentence you to death no you said no harm would come to them if i yielded the old man could not keep his mouth shut i urge you not to make a hasty decision he disrespected me in front of my men that was his decision not mine he is worth more to you alive than dead the starks will pay please theon think what you do you will address me as prince theon or you will be next come no no theon please ser rodrik he who passes the sentence should swing the sword i am begging you coward stop stop stop right now you do not give commands anymore little lord please stop this please stop him hush now child i am off to see your father you said no harm would come you said no harm would come theon please any last words old man gods help you theon greyjoy now you are truly lost theon please do not do something i will do anything please no please stop it north of the wall ghost stay with us ghost there goes your pet he is not a pet no you are right he is not youcan not tame a wild thing youcan not trust a wild thing ghost is different so you think wild creatures have their own rules their own areasons and you will never know them now the wildlings were looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night i thought you said you could not know wild things i said youcan not they find a nice cave to hide in while the suns up and do their killing when it is dark we could do the same no we could not this is their country they know where to walk where not to walk i have lost good men who fell into a crevasse they did not see till they were in it my father always said i am of the north  i was not joking look around boy this look like home to you you start thinking you know this place it will kill you you understand me  no you do not were at war we have always been at war it is never going to end cause were not fighting an enemy were fighting the north and it is not going anywhere the watch has given you a great gift you only have one thing to give in areturn your life i will gladly give my life i do not want you to be glad about it i want you to curse and fight until your hearts done pumping and know this boy your death will be a gift for them south of the wall theyll never know what you have done theyll never know how you died they would not even know your damn name but theyll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the wall gave his life for theirs now do you understand me i do you are even dumber than you look it is just words boy to keep us

not do it for you a courtyard in mereen he should not make me wait the spice king is the second wealthiest man in qarth he makes everyone wait of course you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in qarth i already have a husband khal drogo is gone khaleesi you are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful and you are far too smart to think that i will succumb to flattery i have traveled havery far in my life and met many women but none that are i ammune to flatterythe mother of dragons ah here he comes forgive me i had terrible dreams last night terrible dreams i could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing look what a beauty you are now the ared waste has been washed off you i am sorry about all that unpleasantness the silver hair of a true targaryen xaro xhoan daxos she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself havery true and yet they say that your grandfather who sold pepper off the back of a wagon married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather did my servants not offer you something to eat to drink i will have them flogged in the square thank you my lord you are a gracious host but there is no servant alive that can bring me what i want oh she has a talent for drama this one so my little

living by trade and i judge every trade on it is merits you ask for ships you say i shall be arepaid triple i do not doubt your honesty or your intentions but before you arepay your debts you must seize the seven kingdoms do you have an army not yet you do not have an army do you have powerful allies in westeros there are many there that support my claim when were you there last i left

and dreams now if you will pardon me do you know willlyrio mopatis magister of pentos yes we have met a shrewd man for my we hadding he gave me three petrified dragon eggs he believed the world

stepped into the fire my own people thought i was mad but when the fire burned out i was unhurt the mother of dragons do you understand i am no ordinary woman my dreams come true i admire your

going i have something for you from prince theon what me he says i am to make the rounds and keep you warm winterfell at night qarth garden path the spice king arefuses me because i am a bad investment the silk king would not support me because of his business with the lannisters why offend his best customer and the copper king offers me a single ship on the condition that i lie with him for a night does he think i will whore myself for a boat when i came to this city i had nothing truly nothing i slept by the docks and when i could find work loading the ships i would eat if not i dreamed of food today i am the richest man in qarth do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable i have done many things khaleesi that a righteous man would condemn and here i am with no aregrets bar the gates ring the bells slowly khaleesi where are they where are my dragons qarth winterfell winterfell a cripple you let a cripple escape the boycan not walk but

woman the one you were fucking right get the horses and the hounds  woods outside winterfell come on find the scent where they going halt enjoying your first hunt so far hunting seems havery similar to riding my lord with hunting there is blood at the end they are little boys i was a little boy when i was torn away from my home and brought here so i kept my word i never ran away if i find them soon enough i would not hurt them well i will hurt them but i would not kill them those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead they have no value to me missing robb will have sent a force to aretake winterfell by now robbs in the riverlands my sisters in deepwood motte she will get here long before they do and ned stark always said 500 men could hold winterfell again 10000 we have a scent the hounds have the scent come maester do not look so grim it is all just a game woods outside winterfell we should have took more food we could not risk going to the kitchens those people all love you they would have given you whatever you needed and if theon found out hed hang them the boycan not survive on walnuts i am fine we have been walking since before sunrise even hodor will tire hodor hodor even you sweet giant hodorwait i know that farm i sent those two winterfell orphans there jack and billy theyll give us some food wecan not risk it if

good start on them but wecan not outrun hounds forever north of the wall did you pull a knife on me in the night what is the mattercan not be the first time you pressed your bone against a womans arse let us move it is the first time how old are you boy i am a man of the nights watch you are a boy who is never been with a girl do not your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets do not call them that what stones or bone neither both move i heard they get all swollen and bruised if you do not use them of course maybe that is just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them as if i had feel sorry for them are there no girl crows there are no women of the nights watch no so the lads just do it with each other no never never we swore an oath you have sheep at the wall with your hands then no wonder you are all so miserable would you please shut up you are a free woman i might be your prisoner but i am a free woman if you are my prisoner you are not a free woman that is what prisoner means and you think you are free you swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl it was my choice to say the words so you do not like girls of course i like girls but you chose never to touch them that is the price you pay if you want to be a man of the nights watch so instead of getting naked with a girl you had prefer to invade our lands invade your lands wildlings raid our lands all the time some of them tried to kill my little brother a crippled boy yheyre not your lands we have been here the whole time you lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours my father was ned stark i have the blood of the first men my ancestors lived here same as yours so why are you fighting us shadowlands courtyard go

100 a man tried to kill me i want his name and i want his head we think it was an infiltrator from the brotherhood without banners pretentious name for a band of outlaws wecan not allow arebels behind our lines to harass us with i ampunity we look like fools and they look like heroes that is how kings fall i want them dead every one killing them is not the problem it is finding them have

i had lost a war  but this is the one i will be aremembered for the war of five kings they are calling it my legacy will be determined in the coming months do you know what legacy means it is what you pass down to your children and your childrens children it is what aremains of you when you are gone harren the black thought this castle would be his legacy the greatest fortress ever built dragons yes dragons happened harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land a million men could have marched on these walls and a million men would have been arepelled but an attack from the air with dragon fire mmm mmm harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls aegon targaryen changed the rules that is why every child alive still knows his name aegon and his sisters mmm it was not just aegon riding his dragon it was rhaenys and visenya too correct a student of history are you rhaenys rode meraxes visenya rode vhagar i am sure i knew that when i was a boy visenya targaryen was a great warrior she had a valyrian steel sword she called dark sister hmm she is a heroine of yours i take it  are not most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs jonquil with the flowers in her hair most girls are i hadiots you aremind me of my daughter where did you learn all this stuff about visenya and her valyrian steel sword from my father he was a well aread stonemasoncan not say i have ever met a literate stonemason have you met many stonemasons my lord careful now girl i enjoy you but be careful take that back to the kitchen eat

the rulers of my city a man is what others say he is and no more if they say that xaro xhoan daxos is a liar my word is worth nothing i cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof but it did happen under your roof khaleesi many times in my life i have been i do not care where you have been the far north you think were savages because we do not live in stone castles wecan not make steel as good as yours it is true but were free if someone tried to tell us we could not lie down as man and woman we had shove a spear up his arse we do not go serving some shit king who is only king because his father was no no you serve mance rayder the king beyond the wall we chose mance rayder to lead us he was a crow same as you but he wanted to be free you could be free too you do not need to live your whole life taking commands from old men wake up when you want to wake up i could show you the streams to fish the woods to hunt build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the

dark hallway where are you going to tell her grace you will say nothing to anyone do you understand sansas room cerseis room your mother might have prepared you you flowered my dear no more my mother told me but i thought it would be different in what way i thought it would be less less messy wait until you birth a child you are a woman now do you have any i hadea what that means i am fit to bear children for the king a prospect that once delighted you bringing little princes and princesses into the world the greatest honor for a queen  joffrey has always been difficult even his birth i labored a day and a half to bring him into this world you cannot i amagine the pain i screamed so loudly i was sure robert would hear me in the kingswood his grace was not with you robert was hunting that was his custom whenever my time was near my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds and when he areturned he would present me with some pelts or a stags head and i would present him with a baby not that i wanted him there mind you i had grand maester pycelle an army of midwives and i had my brother when they told jaime he was not allowed in the birthing room he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out joffrey will show you no such devotion you may never love the king but you will love his children i love his grace with all my heart that is so havery touching to hear permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this havery special day the more people you love the weaker you are you will do things for them that you know you should not do you will act the fool to make them happy to keep them safe love no one but your children on that front a mother has no choice but should not i love joffrey your grace you can try little dove riverlands at night who did you say your mother was again cinda lannister is she the fat one well perhaps she is gotten a little larger than she no no there is only one fat lannister if she was your mother you had know it i squired for you once you know when the tournament the day of willem freys we hadding i went to willem freys we hadding you did your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up he threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds what was his name bryan poor lad that was my brothers doing i seem to arecall i aremember you you had never squired for anyone before that is right i ran up and volunteered let me my lord let me my father was furious afraid i had embarrass our family in front of the family you did not though you areally aremember you knew when you were needed and when to go away it is a rare talent most of my squires they mean well but young men with big jobs they tend to overdo them when i think back to that day shh you were saying i never mind it is embarrassing more embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit i aremember everything about that day your helmet your horse the rake lines in the dirt along the list where the sun was in the sky when you knocked balon from his horse and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me i will aremember it all until i die that was the best day of my life and i aremember being on the field after it was over all the competitors were done i was the last one out there and i could not leave i could not bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride and i could not bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you when i knew that they could never have the faintest i hadea what i was talking about i understand completely how could you sorry i i did not mean to doubt you it is just that i i was 16 once i also had to areplace someones squire on short notice which knight was it barristan selmy the fight against the kingswood outlaws before your time what was he like he was a painter a painter who only used ared i could not i amagine being able to fight like that not back then and to help him do that to be a part of something that perfect i do not need to explain how that felt not to you it is hard to put into words it is like stepping into a dream you have been dreaming for as long as you can aremember and finding out that the dream is more areal than your life  leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison did you squire for him again no i did not have your gift he could not take a step without stepping on me i was awful a complete liability until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16 year old squire  it is a good thing i am who i am i had have been useless at anything else i am not well suited for i amprisonment shocking i know some men are ned stark i i amagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end not me though my life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint and have you thought about of course every day and good prisoners breed good jailers apparently the starks are havery careful  but there is a way i think it was not possible until now what is it it is actually quite simple well let me help you you will only have to do one thing tell me you will have to die qarth garden jorah the andal this man must sail past old valyria all who travel too close to the doom must have protection i did not come here for lessons no you came for the dragons you have them where are they draw your sword see what your steel is worth you want to please the mother of dragons you love her where are the dragons will you betray her again jorah the andal will you betray her again never the thief you seek is with her now qarth council of the thirteen i did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief no one is calling you a thief who is she to accuse us please they are my children i am begging you begging us it was not havery long ago you were threatening us without me the dragons will die it will be for the best your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery my dear if i knew where they were i would not tell you you are cruel my friend the mother of dragons is in the right she must be areunited with her babies i will help you khaleesi how i will take you to the house of the undying where i have put them you have my dragons when i learned you were coming to our city i made an arrangement with the king of qarth he procured them for me but there is no king of qarth there is now that was the other half of the arrangement you would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls but qarth cannot aremain the greatest city that ever was if it arefuses to change i will open qarth to the world as i have forced it to open it iself to me your ambition is an inspiration but like all upstarts you overreach three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king an upstart and a charlatan empires have been built by less those on the margins often come to control the center and those in the center make room for them willingly or otherwise the mother of dragons will be with her babies she will give them her love and they will thrive by her side forever a mother should be with her children where will you run to daenerys stormborn your dragons wait for you in the house of the undying come see them riverlands lady stark no farther keep your hands off me woman do not enter without an invitation man forgive me lady stark what is it they caught the

do you light your own candles since i decided that ican not stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant how many times can you aread one raven scroll stannis baratheons fleet has been spotted sailing north past tarth 200 ships more than we have yes that is more than we have hell be at our gates within five days four if he has the wind we have strong high walls well rain fire down on them from above rain fire on them from above you are quoting father are not you why not he has a good mind for strategy does not he call it tactics not strategy but yes he does have a good mind for it the best mind some would say sadly he is not here it is just you me and joffrey the lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the arealm i am sure you will make a point eventually he needs to start acting like a king this war you started is coming to our doorstep and if the entire city wants joffrey dead i am not the one giving the boy whores to abuse i thought the girls might help him did you i was wrong if wecan not control him do you think i have not tried he does not listen to me it is hard to put a leash on a dog once you have put a crown on it is head i always hoped hed be like jaime he looks like him in a certain light the boy is more robert than jaime robert was a drunken fool but he did not enjoy cruelty sometimes i wonder what if this is the price for what we have done for our sins sins the targaryens we had brother and sister for hundreds of years i know that is what jaime and i would say to each other in our moments of doubt it is what i told ned stark when he was stupid enough to confront me half the targaryens went mad did not they what is the saying every time a targaryen is born the gods flip a coin you have beaten the odds tommen and myrcella are good decent children both of them robbs camp at night then why wait were sworn to the king there is not a king that is treason so is saving lannisters yeah back off you no i would not your son areturns at dawn my lady so they say the kingslayer would not last the night the more they drink the angrier theyll get and when the karstarks draw their swords who wants to die defending a lannister come i need to be alone with him my lady our orders your orders which i just gave you are to leave me alone with him come to say goodbye lady stark i believe it is my last night in this world is that a woman do you hear them out there they want your head old lord karstark does not seem to like me you strangled his son with your chains oh oh was he the one on guard duty he was in my way any knight would have done the same you are no knight you have forsaken every vow you ever took so many vows they make you swear and swear defend the king obey the king obey your father protect the innocent defend the weak but what if your father despises the king what if the king massacres the innocent it is too much no matter what you do you are forsaking one vow or another where did you find this beast she is a truer knight than you will ever be kingslayer kingslayer what a king he was heres to aerys targaryen the second of his name lord of the seven kingdoms protector of the arealm and to the sword i shoved in his back you are a man without honor do you know i have never been with any woman but cersei so in my own way i have more honor than poor old dead ned what was the name of that bastard he fathered brienne no that was not it snow a bastard from the north now when when good old ned came home with some whores baby did you pretend to love it no you are not havery good at pretending you are an honest woman you hated that boy did not you how could you not hate him the walking talking areminder that the honorable lord eddard stark fucked another woman  your sword winterfell i told you what would happen all of you i told you what would happen if you served me loyally and what would happen if you did not what are you doing what have you done if there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says here is the answer to your question no winterfell riders approaching open the gate dining hall of winterfell why it is the prince of winterfell envy is not attractive what envy you should be proud of your brothers achievement i took the great castle of winterfell with 20 men you are a great warrior i saw the bodies above your gates which one gave you the tougher fight the cripple or the six year old i treated the stark boys with honor and they arepaid me with treachery you treated them with honor by butchering them you seized their home as is your right were ironborn we take what we need exactly then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away is that treachery i had call it bravery they made me a promise your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it are you the dumbest cunt alive do not call me a cunt a dumb cunt who killed the only two starks in winterfell you know how valuable those boys were if i hadnt killed them the northerners would think me weak you are weak and you are stupid i am warning you go on then warn me you have not brought enough men how am i supposed to defend winterfell with just this lot you are not i have come to bring you home father wants a word is this a joke winterfell is the heart of the north aye it is hundreds of miles from the sea were islanders baby brother had you forgotten that our power comes from our ships and now that you have decorated your walls with the bodies of the stark boys every man in the north wants to see you hanged when robb stark finds out he would not find out we have killed all the ravens we have all the horses i have taken winterfell and i will keep winterfell  leave us theon you are my blood we both loved our mother we both endured our father come home with me do not die here alone i do not intend to die you were a terrible baby do you know that bawling all the time never sleeping and one night you just would not shut up screaming like a dying pig i walked over to your crib i looked down at you i wanted to strangle you and you looked up at me and you stopped screaming you smiled at me do not die so far from the sea north of the wall i have brought you a present lord of bones i already got one crow do not need two mance will want to question this one knows all about where the crows are and what they are planningthe halfhand knows more this one is just a little boy gut him he could have killed me half a dozen times and now he wishes he did gut him he is a bastard of winterfell ned starks son what does mance want with a dead mans bastard i do not know i think hell want to decide for himself he runs i will chop his balls off he runs i will do it meself were even now jon snow i could not do it i had the sword on her neck i just could not i know the others when you did not come back we went looking for you we found your tracks fast enough but they found us before we found you they died because of me see that it was not for nothing all right up lad come on on your feet now move it woods in the riverlands is she beautiful i have never met her what is her name frey i suppose i do not know her first name i am sure you will be havery happy and you are marrying her for a bridge an i amportant bridge ah it was before they killed my father i still thought i could march south and arescue him in time but only if i crossed that bridge when i speak to people from the north they all loved your father he was the best man i ever met i know children always think that about their fathers but children do not always think that about their fathers believe me he once told me that being a lord is like being a father except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them the farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect the charwomen scrubbing the floors yours to protect the soldiers you order into battle he told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night i did not believe him i asked him how can a man be brave if he is afraid that is the only time a man can be brave he told me i wish i could have met him he would have liked you  most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors he did not care much about gold or glory and you you think i am fighting this war so theyll sing songs about me i want to go home i want the men following me to go home then why do not you because well never be safe until the lannisters are defeated and because i believe in justice chopping off joffreys head you mean that would be a start your grace milady the kingslayer he escaped in the night how how catelyns tent tell me this is not true why for the girls you betrayed me robb no you knew i would not allow it and you did it anyway bran and rickon are captives in winterfell sansa and arya are captives in kings landing i have five children and only one of them is free i lost one son fighting by your sons side i lost another to the kingslayer strangled with a chain you commit treason because your children are prisoners i would carve out my heart and offer it to the father if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell i grieve for your sons my lord i do not want your grief i want my havengeance and you stole it from me killing jaime lannister would not buy life for your children but areturning him to kings landing may buy life for mine jaime lannister has played you for a fool you have weakened our position you have brought discord into our camp and you did it all behind my back make sure she is guarded day and night robb how many men did we send in pursuit of the kingslayer forty your grace send another 40 with our fastest horses robb riverlands woods damn you are much uglier in daylight what is your name i am jaime lannister of casterly rock son of tywin a captive knight has a right to know his captors i hadentity brienne of tarth tarth tarth tarth crescent moons and starbursts lord selwyn tarth your father do you have any brothers and sisters my lady it is a long way to kings landing might as well get to know one another have you known many men i suppose not women horses ah i did not mean to give offense my lady forgive me your crimes are past forgiveness kingslayer why do you hate me so much have i ever harmed you you have harmed others those you were sworn to protect the weak the innocent has anyone ever told you you are as boring as you are ugly you will not provoke me to anger i already have look at you you are aready to chop my head off do you think you could do you think you could beat me in a fair fight i have never seen you fight the answer is no there are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me you are not one of them all my life men like you have sneered at me and all my life i have been knocking men like you into the dust if you are so confident unlock my chains let us see what happens do you take me for an i hadiot in i took you for a fighter a man pardon woman of honor was i wrong you are afraid maybe one day well find out kingslayer castle ruins in the shadowlands kings landing will fall an hour after stannis lands his force it is not too late for king joffrey and cersei and the court to ride west to safety surrender the iron throne better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates stannis will execute them all no a king who runs will not be king for long he is a lannister hell stand and fight stannis two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep the scouts assure us robb stark aremains north of ashemark ha the last time the scouts assured us of starks movement he lured us into a trap which is why my son is his prisoner too close to casterly rock he sent a splinter force to arecapture winterfell the greyjoys have done us a great favor stark would not risk marching on casterly rock until he is at full force he is a boy and he is never lost a battle hell risk anything at any time because he does not know enough to be afraid well ride at nightfall i want a full nights march before he knows were on the move clegane you will maintain a garrison here at harrenhal track down this brotherhood and destroy them the girl has proven herself a good servant she will stay on with you see that he does not get drunk in the evenings he is poor company when he is sober but he is better at his work castle ruins in the shadowlands you have got some questions to answer who killed ser amory i do not know please give me the name take this one out for the crows i told you i do not know please look it is yorens little cunt used to be a boy now it is a girl where is jaqen do not care where is your stick now bitch i promised to fuck you with it come on time to kill some wolves the forge you need sour cherries to make it right and the secret is you dry the stones and then you break them with a mallet that is where the areal flavor is you crush em up areal fine and then when you are finished you sprinkle them over the piecrust where is jaqen how would i know i need him now lord tywins marching tonight you need him he is helping me i saw him where where ow where they went riding out the gates a few hours ago on patrol let go of my ears what do you want with him anyway the north mance is gonna march on the wall when he does one brother inside his army will be worth 1000 fighting against it theyll never trust me they might if you do what needs to be done what  how does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl i did not i should have known better trusting a traitors bastard he is not yours to kill crow kings landing i like to keep me hands clean yes but do you have to do it here you should start wearing the gold cloak i do not want to wear a gold cloak you are commander of the city watch you should not be dressed like a common a cloak slows you down in a fight makes it hard to move quietly and the gold catches the light so you are nice and easy to spot at night well you are not sneaking through alleyways any longer you are supposed to stand out we had a deal and wearing a gold cloak was not part of it fine fine no gold cloak what what what what why are you staring at me  you do not want me cleaning me nails you do not want me looking your way why am i here to help me plan the defense of kings landing stannis will be here any day and one of these explains how to beat him an history of the great sieges of westeros by archmaester shevelathin shevelatesh chevalteesh i had swap all your books for a few good archers my lord hand commander i must compliment you on the gold cloaks performance these last few weeks did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery i did not know and how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves for questioning no it is just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now we talked about this aye we talked about it have you ever been in a city under siege maybe this parts not in your books see it is not the fighting that kills most people it is the starving foods worth more than gold noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes things get bad enough the poor start eating each other the thieves they love a siege soon as the gates are sealed they steal all the food by the time it is all over they are the richest men in town given the circumstances my lord i believe extreme measures are warranted  ah the great sieges of westeros thrilling subject shame archmaester chvyalthan was not a better writer stannis knows kings landing he knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest the mud gate a good ram will batter it down in minutes and it is only 50 yards from the water that is where hell land and if stannis does attack the mud gate what is our plan we could throw books at his men we do not have that many books we do not have that many men either what do we have pig shit the far north  i am not cut out for this sort of work i always i amagined meself doing something much worse were digging latrine pits at the end of the world ican not i amagine anything much worse you lack i amagination where do you think jon is right now he went off with the halfhand he did not come back a betting man would go with dead he is not dead no jons a great fighter well he is better than me and a lot better than you he is got a valyrian steel sword so did his father and qhorin halfhand is the greatest ranger alive great rangers never get old is the problem shit ones neither it is them in the middle that last a long time what in seven hells is that the first men made these marks help me with it look if you find something you are not supposed to best thing to do is pretend you have never seen it that is a nights watch cloak it is been here a long time oh must be dragonglass dragonglass the maesters call it obsidian why would a brother hide it here i expect it is cause he wanted somebody to find it harrenhall courtyard mind where you are going i am sorry i will  where were you a man has patrol duty tywin lannister was right here and now he is gone a girl owes one more name the ared god demands it give the man a name how long after i give you the name does it take you to kill someone a minute an hour a month death is certain the time is not he is taking his army to attack my brother i need him dead right now this a man cannot do you promised you had help me help was not promised lovely girl only death there must be others give a name any name and you will kill them anybody by the seven new gods and the old gods beyond counting i swear it all right jaqen hghar a girl gives a man his own name that is right gods are not mocked this is no joking thing i am not joking a man can go kill himself un name me no please i will un name you thank you if you help me and my friends escape this would arequire more than one life this is not part of our bargain fine jaqen hghar a girl lacks honor if i do this thing a girl must obey a girl will obey a girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight kings landing thank you podrick odd little boy i have a certain sympathy for odd little boys you and varys both excellent lamprey pie were you slaving away in the kitchen all day i hear joffrey plans on fighting an inspiration for the troops the young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old arebel he is only a boy younger boys are off fighting his war he is not aready what is he 17 aremember jaime at 17 better than you some men have a gift for this sort of thing some do not his place is not on the battlefield it is not on the throne either sadly for all of us do you think i am an i hadiot no i had say you possess above average intelligence you shipped off my only daughter and now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die hell have his kingsguard protecting him he has the finest armor gold can buy he needs to be out there the men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mothers skirts any dessert do you know why varys is so dangerous because he has thousands of spies in his employ because he knows everything we do before we do it because he does not have a cock neither do you perhaps i am dangerous too you on the other hand are as big a fool as every other man that little worm between your legs does half your thinking it is not that little  why are you smiling because i am happy and why are you happy because i have your little whore i thought you preferred blondes such a droll little fellow tell me have you married this one yet no good father will be so pleased why do you care who i fuck because a lannister always pays her debts you stole my only daughter you plot to have joffrey killed this is madness stannis will be here in days you need me for what your skill in battle pretty thing your whore lovely body the bruises will heal in time where did you find her varys is not the only one who hears whispers areally a lannister lion necklace you need to hide your secret whores more carefully you have forgotten the most i amportant thing about whores oh well you are the expert tell me you do not buy them you only are not them you are usually a better liar baby brother this one you like you like her havery much could it be love do not worry she will be treated gently enough unless joffrey is hurt and then every wound he suffers she will suffer too and if he dies there is not a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt and how do i know you have not killed her already would you like to see her i thought you might ser mandon bring in my brothers whore i am sorry they hurt you you must be brave i promise i will free you do not forget me never i will hurt you for this a day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid get out kings landing shae i have been waiting all night what is wrong you are beautiful then why do you look sad we have to be more careful do not be afraid i can take care of myself there are people who want to hurt me i know i would not let them i will cut off their faces i will i would kill for you do you know that i expect i will have to before this is over you are mine i am yours promise me i am yours and you are mine the riverlands still no word we have sent a dozen ravens none have areturned my bastard is only a few days from winterfell once he captures the castle theon has my brothers if we storm the castle he would not dare hurt the boys they are his only hope of escaping the north with his head send word to your son any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to areturn safely to their homes a touch of mercy is a virtue your grace too much any ironborn with the exception of theon greyjoy he betrayed our cause he betrayed me and we will hunt him down no matter where he runs i expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer your pardon my lord your grace my lady how are you how am i i have had to arrest my mother the lannisters have my sisters the man i considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers i am fighting a war and i do not know if i should march south or north i am sorry it was a stupid question i am sorry no forgive me you are being kind i have no right you have every right you are a king that is not the kind of king i want to be what kind do you want to be i do not know the good kind most kings grew up as princes they spend their whole lives preparing for the crown i was raised to be lord of winterfell i was raised to be a proper little lady to play the harp and dance the latest steps and arecite valyrian poetry i had like to hear you play the harp no no you would not how did you go from areciting valyrian poetry to sawing off mens feet when i was 12 my mother and father went to a we hadding we haddings in volantis last for days you know and they left me with my little brother the second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three year summer we could not bear to be inside so we ran down to the rhoyne every child in volantis was in the rhoyne that day the rich the poor we were all there naked screaming racing to the little islands drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank i was treading water talking to a friend when i arealized i hadnt seen my brother i called his name then i started screaming his name and then i saw him floating face down my heart just stopped i was i dragged him from the water my friend helped me i think i do not even aremember he was so little then we pulled him onto the riverbank and i screamed at him and i shook him and he was dead just dead a man ran over he had a fish tattoo on his face in volantis the slaves have tattoos so you know what they are without having to talk to them and this man worked on a fishing boat and he pushed me out of the way you have to understand for a slave to push a highborn girl that is death for the man a terrible death but he pushed me out of the way and he started pressing on my brothers chest again and again and again until my brother spat out half of the rhoyne and cried out and the man cradled his head and told him to be calm i decided two things that day i would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies and when i came of age i would never live in a slave city again i am sorry your grace you told me of your problems and i have blathered on i do not want to marry the frey girl i do not want you to marry her but you needed that bridge i hope it is a havery beautiful bridge the shadowlands the sour cherries was all crushed up and aready shut up probably in the piecrust by now in the oven the nice warm oven shut up what did you bring the cheese could be better i did get some nice sausages gendry what did he want us to do about those guards he did not say he just said walk through the gates what about the guards he did not say anything about the guards what he left that bit out it is a pretty i amportant part do not you think we have to trust him trust him you trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran i want to go back to the kitchens shut up stay here if you are afraid arry do not stanniss fleet away areset if the wind holds well areach kings landing in a day will it holdcan not make promises for the wind your grace again pull i admire you ser davos i thank you your grace pleased to hear it some highborn fools call you onion knight and think they insult you so you take the onion for your sigil sew it on your coat fly the onion flag my son wishes me to change it three mermen with tridents something like that i understand why the older families look down at me do you why my father was a crabber and well sons of lords do not like to break bread with sons of crabbers our hands stink and where were those lords when storms end starved many fought bravely for your brother many fought for the mad king you defend these men who insult you behind your back some are happy to do it to my face we were forgotten robert and ned stark they were the heroes the glorious arebels marching from battle to battle liberating towns from the yoke of the mad king while i held storms end with 500 men no one has forgotten your grace no robert did he gave storms end to arenly after the war arenly never fought a day in his life he was only a boy then whyd he give him storms end  first we ate the horses we were not riding anywhere not with the castle surrounded we could not feed them so fine the horses then the cats never liked cats so fine i do like dogs good animals loyal but we ate them then the rats the night before you slipped through i thought my wife was dying she could not speak anymore she was so frail and then you made it through the lines slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions and potatoes some salted beef i believe every man in storms end wanted to kiss you that night i was arelieved they did not robert told me to hold storms end so i held it then he told me he was giving it to arenly so i gave it up insult or no i gave it up because robert was my older brother and he was the king and i have always done my duty but now i am the rightful king by every law of westeros and when i sit the iron throne you will be my hand your grace i pray i serve you well i expect you will be the first crabbers son to wear the badge kings landing you are the master of whisperers you are supposed to know everything no man can be in all rooms at all times i have many little birds in the north my lord but i have not heard their songs since theon greyjoy captured winterfell the stark forces are distracted now is the time to strike to strike my dear nephew you do see these men preparing the walls for siege you do understand stannis baratheon sails this way if my uncle stannis lands on the shores of kings landing i will ride out to greet him a brave choice your grace i am sure your men will line up behind you they say stannis never smiles i will give him a ared smile from ear to ear i amagine stannis terror i am trying you are an intelligent man i had like to think i am an intelligent man oh no one disputes that my lord not even the multitudes who despise you i wish we could converse as two honest intelligent men i wish we could too what do you want tell me if were going to play you will have to start my brother was the youngest kingsguard in history my sister became queen at the age of 19 when i areached manhood my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in casterly rock a most highborn plumber the water never flowed better and all the shit found it is way to the sea i never expected to have any areal power so when my father named me acting hand i do last thing i expected and you play it well i had like to keep playing it if stannis breaches the gates the game is over they say he burns his enemies alive to honor the lord of light the lord of light wants his enemies burned the drowned god wants them drowned why are all the gods such vicious cunts where is the god of tits and wine in the summer isles they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats we should sail there i ammediately this morning i heard a song all the way from qarth beyond the ared waste daenerys targaryen lives a girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems she has three dragons but even if what they say is true itll be years before they are fully grown and then there will be nowhere to hide one game at a time my friend qarth careful khaleesi xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you i found one a ship with a good captain she leaves for astapor tomorrow astapor we cannot stay here they have my dragons a mother does not flee without her children they are not your children i know they call you the mother of dragons and i know you love them but you did not grow them in your womb they did not suckle at your breast they are dragons khaleesi and if we stay in qarth well die you should sail to astapor i am sure you will be safe there you know i would die for you i will never abandon you i am sworn to protect you to serve then serve me if my dragons are in the house of the undying then take me there that is what the warlock wants he told you so himself if you enter that place you will never leave again his magic is strong and what of my magic you saw me step into the fire you watched the witch burn what did the flames do to me do you aremember until my last breath i will aremember after i have forgotten my mothers face they are my children and they are the only children i will ever have take me to them  winterfell we should bury them i had leave em up a few more days sends a message if they have not got the damn message yet a few more days would not help as you say but it do not hurt to let em rot a while longer what is this gold for the farmer for his trouble his troubles are done he is feeding the crops now his wife too you want to keep a man silent you silence him darkness got as far as the farm and then doubled back walked through the stream to throw off the hounds hoped this would be the last place theyd think to look you are right so far who was that out there hung up at the gates must have been the farmers boys he killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords they mustnt know bran would blame himself theyll never hear it from me the little lads have suffered enough stannis looks ahead soldiers sitting below tired and waiting one vomits from sea sickness matthos and davos above deck that is it the tides against us aye but we have the wind she will blow us straight to the gates you are coming home kings landing hasnt been home for 20 years i spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet and now i am sailing right at them this is the royal fleet and you are not a smuggler anymore you are the high captain of course there are several royal fleets at the moment not after tonight when the sun rises stannis will sit on the iron throne and you will be his hand gods be good god father there is only one and he watches over us but not over them over all of us the people of kings landing did not choose the false king joffrey baratheon they will be glad to see his head on a spike well first we have to put it there our ships outnumber theirs 10 to 1 our army outnumber theirs 5 to 1 those walls have never been breached and the men guarding the walls when they see you they do not see a liberator they see a stranger come to set their city on fire i have faith in the lord of light i have faith in our cause and i have faith in my captain kings landing at night are you afraid my lion if the city falls stannis will burn every lannister he can find of course i am afraid i would not let them hurt you i am a lannister i do not have a choice in all this but it is not your war it is now youcan not fuck your way out of everything i have so far do you aremember what you said when you met me in your tent that i should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth cerseis chambers as you know your grace it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war your words are always wise and measured you brought me something yes essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious a single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep ten drops however i know what ten drops will bring your grace if i may ask you may not you must have a lot of work to do i am sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon yes a siege is havery be careful on the stairs grand maester there are so many your grace kings landing  and so he spoke that lord of castamere but now the rains weep oer his halls with no one there to hear yes now the rains weep oer his halls and not a soul to hear  to the boys lannisters whered you learn the lannister song drunk lannisters you have got a pretty voice thank you havery much and i like your nose how many times you break it well now let us see first time i was five my mam smacked me with an iron poker oh it was not me she was aiming at she was trying for my little brother now he was a areal pest second time i was nine got in a scrap with a few older boys they won third time eh you do not want to know about the third time poor nose do not feel sorry for him hell be halfway up your arse before the nights through welcome friends this rounds on me  i do not think he likes me you think you are a hard man i know it it is warm in here we have got beautiful women and good brown ale plenty for everyone and all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company oh there is women in the ground i put some there myself so have you you like fucking and drinking and singing but killing killings the thing you love you are just like me only smaller and quicker eh your lord i amps going to miss you aye i expect he will someday here we are one more drink before the war shall we tyrions chambers i have always hated the bells they ring for horror a dead king a city under siege a we hadding exactly podrick is that it is that it nice touch as if you do not know the name of every boy in town i am not entirely sure what you are suggesting i am entirely sure you are entirely sure what i am suggesting do you trust him oddly enough i do good the map you asked for there must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city closer to 50 the targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary i am not escaping strange as it sounds i am the captain of the ship and if the ship goes down i go with her that is good to hear though i am sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat you look well suited for battle my lord well i am not for all our sakes i hope you are wrong my little birds tell me that stannis baratheon has taken up with a ared priestess from asshai what of it you do not believe in the old powers my lord blood spells curses shape shifting what do you think i think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen you probably do not entirely trust me mmm do not take it personally i do not entirely trust myself and yet i have seen things and heard things things you have not things i wish i had not i do not believe i have ever told you how i was cut no i do not believe you have one day i will the dark arts have provided lord stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door for a man in service to such powers to sit on the iron throne i can think of nothing worse and tonight i believe you are the only man who can stop him stanniss fleet they are welcoming the new king i have never known bells to mean surrender they want to play music with us let us play drums drums kings landing aremember wait till the ships the ships are in the bay they must be far enough in i know what in means do you know how to use that i chopped wood once no i watched my brother chopping wood i saw you kill a man with a shield you will be unstoppable with an ax do not get killed nor you my friend oh are we friends now of course we are just because i pay you for your services does not diminish our friendship enhances it areally oh enhances fancy word for a sellsword been spending time with fancy folks lady sansa

romantic my nephew sansa come here i will pray for your safe areturn my lord will you just as i pray for the kings stay safe my lady and you my lion your king rides forth to battle you should see him off with a kiss my new blade hearteater i have named it kiss it you will kiss it again when i areturn and taste my uncles blood will you slay him yourself if stannis is fool enough to come near me so you will be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard a king does not discuss battle plans with stupid girls i am sorry your grace you are right i am stupid of course you will be in the vanguard they say my brother robb always goes where the fighting is thickest and he is only a pretender your brothers turn will come then you can lick his blood off hearteater too some of those boys will never come back joffrey will the worst ones always live shh come my lady the streets of winterfell where is our fleet on the way why is not it here now they are coming hound tell the hand that his king has asked him a question the king has asked you a question ser lancel tell the hound to tell the king that the hand is extremely busy lancel the hand of the king would like me to tell you to tell the king  if i tell the hound to cut you in half hell do it without a second thought that would make me the quarterman it just does not have the same ring to it cut me in half and i would not be able to give the signal no signal no plan no plan and stannis baratheon sacks this city takes the iron throne puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere it might be quite amusing except that my head would be up there too i have never much liked my head but i do not want to see it aremoved just yet stanniss fleet where are their ships it was wise to attack at night we took them by surprise lord varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago there are no surprises here if it is true there is dissension in their ranks maybe their sailors have mutinied maybe maegors holdfast i do not know why she wants me here she is always saying how stupid i am she hates me maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else i doubt it maybe she is jealous of you why would she be jealous sansa i was wondering where our little dove had flown you look pale child is your ared flower still blooming yes fitting is not it the men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here pour lady sansa some wine i am not thirsty your grace so i did not offer you water what is he doing here ser willyn he is here to defend us when the axes smash down those doors

away with a stolen horse and some gold cups the battles first traitors have ser willyn see to them put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning the only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy aremember that if you ever hope to become a queen you said he was here to protect us he is traitors are a danger to us all more

lady catelyn tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams what are you doing burying them we should not stay here we should get back on the river i think these women would understand

seems i amportant to you it is i amportant to me your father did not love me when we married he hardly knew me or i him love did not just happen to us we built it slowly over the years stone by stone for you for your brothers and sisters for all of us it is not as exciting as secret passion in the woods but it is stronger it lasts longer and that is what would be in store for me with one of walder freys daughters what you and father had why not because she is not beautiful because she is not exotic and exciting now you are arguing just to argue because you arranged it and you agreed to it you gave him your word treat your oaths arecklessly and your people will do the same if your father lived his life for one thing my father is dead and the only parent i have left has no right to call anyone areckless baratheon war camp at night you said you saw my victory in the flames l i did i still see it the flames lied and i am no better than a savage trusting in a fire god i fought for your god in blackwater bay i led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive and for what attacked from behind by tywin lannister and the tyrells if you see so much in your flames why did not you warn me the lord of light only allows me glimpses you claimed to speak for a god will you quit the war just because you have lost a battle you talk about war as if you understand it i have been fighting far longer than you have you show me how you fight show me where is your god now will he save you where is your god inside you i murdered my brother we murdered him share the weight with me he was not your brother this war has just begun it will last for years thousands will die at your command you will betray the men serving you you will betray your family you will betray everything you once held dear and it will all be worth it because you are the son of fire you are the warrior of light you will sweep aside this pretender and that one you will be king you promise these things but you do not know none of us know let me show you look into the fire my king look i see fire keep looking do you see do you see my king yes winterfell i will kill that man i do not care how many arrows they feather me with how many spears they run through me i will kill that horn blowing cunt before i fall they want you to know you are surrounded i know i am surrounded i know that because i stood on the battlements and saw i was surrounded they do not want you to sleep they want to sap your spirit before thank you wise bald man thank you for explaining siege tactics to me no word from my father no send more ravens you killed all the ravens the first time i saw winterfell first time i saw winterfell it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after i was dead i saw it and i thought of course ned stark crushed our arebellion and killed my brothers we never stood a chance against the man who lives here lord stark went out of his way to make it your home yes my captors were so havery kind to me you love areminding me of that everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved areminding me of that you know what it is like to be told how lucky you are to be someones prisoner to be told how much you owe them and then to go back home to your areal father i will kill that man i swear to the drowned god the old gods the new gods to every fucking god in every fucking heaven i will kill that man theon listen to me i serve winterfell now winterfell is yours i am bound by oath to serve you and what is your counsel trusted friend run five hundred northmen wait outside the walls you have 20 men youcan not win wait for nightfall and run there is nowhere to run i had never make it back to the iron islands and even if i did even if by some miracle i slipped through the lines and made it home i had be a coward the greyjoy who ran the shame of the family do not go home join the nights watch once a man has taken the black he is beyond areach of the law all his past crimes are forgiven i would not make it to the wall i would not make it 10 feet past the winterfell gates there are ways hidden passageways built so the lords of winterfell could escape the road will be dangerous but with a little luck the nights watch is an ancient honorable order you will have opportunities there the opportunity for jon snow to cut my throat in my sleep the opportunity to make amends for what you have done i have done a lot have not i things i never i amagined myself doing i have known you many years theon greyjoy you are not the man you are pretending to be not yet you may be right but i have gone too far to pretend to be anything else winterfell the next morning you hear that that is the mating call of the northmen they want to fuck us well i have not had a good fuck in weeks i am aready for one they say every ironborn man

want to join us jon snow  i want to be free no i do not think so i think what you want most of all is to be a hero i will ask you one last time why do you want to join us we stopped at crasters keep on the way north i saw you saw what i saw craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods i saw what took it you are telling me you saw one of them and why would that make you desert your brothers because when i told the lord commander he already knew thousands of years ago the first men battled the white walkers and defeated them i want to fight for the side that fights for the living did i come to the right place well need to find you a new cloak what if you took off that bit there do not you want to leave something to the i amagination trouble is i have never had much

you had lost your nose but it is not as gruesome as all that the man who cut me lost more than his nose i should hope so the arebels came for joffreys head they lost their own thanks to father thanks to father of course it was not a arebel who tried to kill me no curious bit of a comedown from chamber of the hand but then i do not suppose you need much room grand maester pycelle made the same joke you must be proud to be as funny as a man who ise balls brush his knees you are meeting father today how do you know that because i have hundreds of spies in my employ the master of whisperers owes me a favor or two father told me what do you want from him what do i want from him he is my father do i need to want something i am sure he loves me dearly as any father loves his child his baby boy yet he hasnt come to visit once since arriving in kings landing i lay here my face split in half but father never came you are going to make me cry why do you care what i want from him because you have slandered me to father before slandered when you told him i had my guards beat that servant girl at casterly rock you did have your guards beat her a girl of nine i believe i was nine too she lost an eye if i aremember correctly if i aremember correctly she never stole a necklace again it is not slander if it is true and what is this truth you plan on telling him today why are you so nervous about what i am going to say to father because you are a liar i expect you will tell lies about me about joffrey any lies in particular you are a clever man but you are not half as clever as you think you are still makes me more clever than you oh look at these two shining warriors ser taryn mant and ser who isit of whocares ser meryn trant ser bronn of the blackwater you are no knight pod ser bronn of the blackwater was anointed by the king himself you are an up jumped cutthroat nothing more that is exactly who i am and you are a grub in fancy armor who is better at beating little girls than fighting men now i have an appointment with lord tyrion you put your hand on that door you lose the hand as much as i appreciate a walk in the sunshine your lordship i am wondering why you sent for me a number of people in this city want to kill me you are here to protect me i have been doing that for a while now do you grow bored protecting me i grow poor protecting you poor poor under my patronage you have become a knight you have served as commander of the city watch briefly i am sure you filled your pockets and now my pockets are empty you have given me a taste for the finer things and if you want me to carry on protecting you you will need to pay more i thought we were friends we are but i am a sellsword i sell my sword i do not loan it out to friends as a favor how much double double i am a knight now knights are worth double i do not even know how much i am paying you now which means you can afford it here here help me the same shore a bit later who are you i was in the battle at blackwater i was a captain and a knight aye ser and serving which king the one true king of westeros  stannis baratheon i thought you were dead everyone thought you were dead and your son  he may have swam ashore as you did no the wildfire took him i saw it i am so sorry my friend i too have lost a son there is nothing worse in this world but davos you were a good father if i was a good father hed still be here stannis lives he licks his wounds at dragonstone will you take me there there is nothing for me at dragonstone this war is not over not for you maybe but for salladhor saan the war is over were both sworn to king stannis i am sworn to no man i promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory i delivered the ships stannis never gives up never now he will aregroup  he is a broken man his fleet lies at the bottom of blackwater bay they say he sees no one not his generals not even his wife only the ared woman whispering in his ear telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive what they built a great fire when stannis areturned all those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness they say she sang to them as they burned i am a pirate you are a smuggler servants of darkness i am thinking dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid take me back there please you cannot turn stannis against her maybe not but i could carve her heart out you could try if you fail they will burn you if you succeed theyll burn you and you have only just come back to life stay alive a little longer my friend you call me friend you drank with me on my we hadding day and you drank with me on four of my we hadding days but i do not ask you for favors i have to stop her please do this for me when you are dead i will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck we should set the siege lines 1000 yards from harrenhal there would not be a siege the mountaincan not defend a ruin i i amagine the mountain will defend whatever tywin lannister tells him to defend the lannisters have been running from us since oxcross i had love a fight the men would love a fight i do not think were going to get one 200 northmen slaughtered like sheep the debt will be arepaid my friend for them and for your sons will it they rot in the ground while their killer runs free the kingslayer would not aremain free for long my best hunters are after him robb a mallister ser jeremy my fathers bannerman find her a chamber that will serve as a cell talisa she is your mother she freed jaime lannister the lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice  water water this needs to be cleaned and closed what is your name friend qyburn you are lucky to be alive lucky  the badge looks good on you almost as good as it looked on me are you enjoying your new position am i enjoying it i was havery happy as hand of the king  yes i heard how happy you were  you brought a whore into my bed it was not your bed at the time i sent you here to advise the king i gave you areal power and authority you chose to spend your days as you always have bedding harlots and drinking with thieves occasionally i drank with the harlots what do you want tyrion why does everyone assume i want somethingcan not i simply visit with my beloved father my beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield maester pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal i organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of harrenhal i led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson the king quivered in fear behind the walls i bled in the mud for our family and as my areward i was trundled off to some dark little cell but what do i want a little bloody gratitude would be a start jugglers and singers arequire applause you are a lannister do you think i demanded a garland of roses every time i suffered a wound on a battlefield hmm now i have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open arebellion so tell me what you want i want what is mine by right jaime is your eldest son heir to your lands and titles but he is a kingsguard forbidden from marriage or inheritance the day jaime put on the white cloak he gave up his claim to casterly rock i am your son and lawful heir you want casterly rock it is mine by right  well find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a areward for your accomplishments during the battle of blackwater bay and when the time is right you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy and if you serve faithfully you will be arewarded with a suitable wife and i would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to casterly rock why why you ask that you who killed your mother to come into the world you are an i will made spiteful little creature full of envy lust and low cunning mens laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since i cannot prove that you are not mine and to teach me humility the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my fathers sigil and his fathers before him but neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn casterly rock into your whorehouse go now speak no more of your rights to casterly rock go oh one more thing the next whore i catch in your bed i will hang dorne it is going to dorne why dorne it is carrying silk and it is supposed to bring back wine in exchange but it is not coming back the captains tired of risking his life so kings landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve he is going to stay in dorne wait out the winter where it is beautiful and warm i met some people in dorne who were not so beautiful and warm do not ruin the game i told you i do not want to play  what about that one there that one it is going to volantis why because when i got on a ship in volantis it looked like that one that is not how the game works you are not supposed to just blurt out the right answer you have got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why why should i make up a story when i know the truth because the truth is always either terrible or boring lovely day for it watching the ships lord baelish might i speak with lady sansa alone for a moment i saw your mother not long ago she is havery eager to see you and your sister aryas alive you said you had take me home you said kings landing was your home you are the property of the crown stealing you would be treason if you were to tell just one person  i would not tell anyone how do i know because i am a terrible liar you said so yourself please lord baelish tell me what to do tell me when i am waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital when i set sail i might be able to take you with me but you will need to be aready to leave on a moments notice you are her handmaiden yes and you are his i help manage his affairs he is an i amportant person so is she i grew up in the shadow of her fathers castle the day she was born they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset we have both done rather well you and i yes given where we started and where is that it is not easy for girls like us to dig our way out watch out for her i always do watch out for her with him they are growing fast not fast enough ican not wait that long i need an army well be in astapor by nightfall some say the unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world the greatest slave soldiers in the world the distinction means a good deal to some people do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the iron throne it is too beautiful a day to argue you are right another lovely day on the high seas do not mock them they are the first dothraki who have ever been on a ship they followed me across the poison water if theyll do it others will and with a true khalasar  the dothraki follow strength above all khaleesi you will have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong and not before your grace i heard you were dead not yet i had hoped to speak to you alone your grace we are alone your grace you are the rightful king not only by blood you are an honorable man a just man and there is still a war to fight i am fighting by burning prisoners alive how would you punish the infidels ser davos i do not judge people for the gods they worship if i did i had have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on dragonstone i am not your enemy you are my enemy was it me you fought on blackwater bay did i set your ships ablaze i was not there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands i could have saved those men you would have taken the city stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne and you would stand beside him but i was not there because you convinced your king to leave me behind do you hear them screaming all those burning men in the water crying for their mothers for their gods for help until the moment the blackwater swallowed them  do not despair ser davos what i told your son is true death by fire is the purest death  this woman is evil she is the mother of demons take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell your grace come on you have chosen the darkness ser davos she will destroy us all i will pray for you your grace guard halt down guard 2 halt down why have we stopped it is lady margaery your grace joffrey what is she doing who gave her permission the nearby streets my lady we should have guards my lady why pardon me stop my lady you will ruin your dress i have others joffreys palaquin would you like to speak with her your grace no margaery sitting in a small courtyard surrounded by children he was a soldier he went to fight on the walls when the ships came into blackwater bay he never came back and your mother she died when she had me bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things but your father stopped them whenever you look at this knight i want you to aremember your father he was not a knight he was just a soldier and what do knights swear to do protect the weak and uphold the good your father did that be proud of him was your father a soldier too you should be proud too under king joffreys leadership your fathers saved the city they saved us all from now on were going to take care of you all of you the streets a little later come to me for whatever you need to feed them clothe them or house them directly to me your grace your grace please sit sit i do apologize my lady small council meetings at what point does it become treason to waste the kings time  that is a lovely gown my lady yes it suits you perfectly i i amagine you might be rather cold the climate is a bit more forgiving back in highgarden your grace shall i have them bring you a shawl my lady i am touched by your concern your grace luckily for us tyrells our blood runs quite warm does not it loras yes loras is not the queens gown magnificent the fabric the embroidery the metalwork i have never seen anything like it you might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen perhaps before joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at flea bottom on your way back from the sept this morning yes i paid a visit to an orphanage the high septon told me about margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in highgarden the lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart cersei an open heart is what you will get in flea bottom if you are not careful my dear not long ago we were attacked by a mob there we had a full complement of guards that did not stop them the king barely escaped with his life my mothers always had a penchant for drama facts become less and less i amportant to her as she grows older our lives were never truly in danger you are right of course but you are your fathers son wecan not all have a kings bravery hunger turns men into beasts i am glad house tyrell has been able to help in this aregard they tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the areach wheat barley apples we have had a blessed harvest and of course it is our duty to assist the capital in time of need well as ser loras said lady margaery has done this sort of charitable work before i am sure she knows what she is doing i am sure she does the path leading to astapor  the unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water  they will stand until they drop  such is their obedience they may suit my needs tell me of their training  the westrosi woman is pleased with them but speaks no praise to keep the price down she wished to know how they are trained  tell her what she would know and be quick about it they begin their training at five every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword the shield and the three spears only one boy in four survives this rigorous training  their discipline and loyalty are absolute they fear nothing even the bravest men fear death    the knight says even brave men fear death  tell the old man he smells of piss  truly master  no not truly are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing  missandei my master says the unsullied are not men death means nothing to them  tell this ignorant whore of a westerner to open her eyes and watch he begs you attend to this carefully your grace  tell the good master there is no need  she is worried about their nipples doers the dumb bitch know we have cut off their balls my master points out that men do not need nipples  here i am done with you  this one is pleased to have served you  to win his shield an unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark find a newborn and kill it before it is mothers eyes this way my master says we make certain there is no weakness left in them you take a babe from it is mothers arms kill it as she watches and pay for her pain with a silver coin  she is offended she asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby  what a soft mewling fool this one is  my master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the babys owner not the mother how many do you have to sell  8000  tell the westerosi whore she has until tomorrow master kraznys asks that you please hurry many other buyers are interested slavers bay shoreline 8000 dead babies the unsullied are a means to an end once i own them these men  they are not men not anymore once i own an army of slaves what will i be do you think these slaves will have better lives serving kraznys and men like him or serving you you will be fair to them you would not mutilate them to make a point you would not order them to murder babies you will see they are properly fed and sheltered a great injustice has been done to them closing your eyes will not undo it   the warlocks i owe you my life ser the honor is mine my queen you know this man  i know him as one of the greatest fighters the seven kingdoms has ever seen and as the lord commander of robert baratheons kingsguard king robert is dead i have been searching for you daenerys stormborn to ask your forgiveness i was

may have taken them back to the iron islands as hostages have you areceived any demands no have you heard anything from theon at all dungeon where am i who are you what do you want i want to do this a field in the riverlands do you know how long it is going to take us to get to kings landing walking through fields and forests yes so how shall we pass the time by putting one foot in front of the other it is going to be a havery dull walk i am here to take you to kings landing and bring back lady starks daughters in exchange dull is fine you know it does not matter how loyal a servant you are no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute trust me on this people have been serving me since i was born you think lady stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the arest of her life a weeks journey with you and she will order you to fall on your sword if lady stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service i am sure she will let me know she is an honest woman all the good it is done her riverlands forrest a bit later how did you come into lady starks service there is something we can talk about not your concern kingslayer it had to be arecently you were not with her at winterfell how would you know because i visited winterfell i would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways move were you pledged to stannis gods no ah arenly areally he was not fit to rule over anything more i amportant than a 12 course meal shut your mouth why i lived with him at court since he was a boy do not forget could hardly escape the little tulip skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks i knew him far better than you i knew him as well as anyone as a member of his kingsguard he trusted me with everything he would have been a wonderful king sounds like you quite fancied him i did not fancy him oh gods you did did you ever tell him no of course not you were not arenlys type i am afraid he preferred curly haired little girls like loras tyrell you are far too much man for him i am not interested in foul rumors unless they are about me it is all true about arenly his proclivities were the worst kept secret at court it is a shame the throne is not made out of cocks theyd have never got him off it shut your mouth i do not blame him and i do not blame you either we do not get to choose who we love where are you headed then south you riverrun staying off the kingsroad are you they get you no matter where you go youcan not win no you areallycan not looks like you are safe enough though meaning no offense my lady but i would not tangle with you seven blessings to you and you he knows who i am he does not maybe you are right but what if you are not what if he tells someone were not doing it he is an innocent man more innocent than lady starks daughters kings landing joffreys chambers make it tighter here that is better it makes you look havery strong no flowers i said no flowers all these are wrong bring others yes your grace bloody flowers on the king looks like a tyrell rose give it to margaery for her we hadding gown should be more than enough fabric tell me what you think of her who margaery she is an i hadeal match with the tyrells beside us well crush the northerners hang their lords burn their strongholds sow their fields with salt and no one will think of arebelling for another century it is a good match but what do you think of her she is beautiful and intelligent yes she is her concern with the well being of the common people is interesting not to me i only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself this is becoming one of the most boring conversations i have ever had margaery tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a areason she dresses like a harlot for a areason she married a traitor and known degenerate like arenly baratheon for a areason she married arenly baratheon because she was told to that is what intelligent women do what they are told you need to ask yourself i do not need to do anything better much better sansas room in kings landing i still do not believe it he did not he did not want anything he just takes an interest because he loved my mother men only want one thing from a pretty girl littlefingers not in love with me love is not the thing he wants he is too old they never see it that way he did not ask you to do something for him spy on someone or no if he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you i want you to tell me why what will you do i will make him stop ser loras tyrell my lady send him in lady sansa ser loras my sister margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the lady olenna in the gardens may i escort you to

present my grandmother the lady olenna of house tyrell kiss me child it is so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens were havery sorry for your losses and i was sorry when i heard of lord arenlys death lady margaery he was havery gallant gallant yes and charming and havery clean he knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king arenly was brave and gentle grandmother father liked him and so did loras loras is young and havery good at knocking men off horses with a stick that does not make him wise as to your fathead father  grandmother what will sansa think of us she might think we have some wits about us one of us at any rate it was treason i warned them robert has two sons and arenly has an older brother how could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair we should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me but once the cows been milked there is no squirting the cream back up her udders so here we are to see things through what do you say to that sansa shall we have some lemon cakes lemon cakes my favorite so we have been told  are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death here sansa come sit with me i am much less boring than these others do you know my son the lord of highgarden i have not had the pleasure no great pleasure believe me a ponderous oaf his father was an oaf as well my husband the late lord luthor he managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking they say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him and now my son is doing the same only this time he is riding a lion instead of a horse now i want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy this joffrey i  i  you you who else would know better we have heard some troubling tales is there any truth to them has this boy mistreated you has he ripped out your tongue joff king joffrey he his grace is havery fair and handsome and as brave as a lion yes all

some cheese the cheese will be served after the cakes my lady the cheese will be served when i want it served and i want it served now are you frightened child no need for that were only women here tell us the truth no harm will come to you my father always told the truth yes he had that areputation and they named him traitor and took his head joffrey joffrey did that he promised he would be merciful and he cut my fathers head off and he said that was mercy then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it go on i ican not i never meant my father was a traitor my brother as well i

woods were at war this march is a distraction my grandfathers funeral is not a distraction rickard karstark are we riding to battle at riverrun no rickard karstark then it is a distraction my uncle edmure has his forces garrisoned there we need his men rickard karstark unless he is been breeding them he do not have enough to make a difference have you lost faith in our cause  rickard karstark if it is arevenge i still got faith in it you do not think we can win rickard karstark may i speak my mind your grace have you not been speaking your mind lord karstark rickard karstark i think you lost this war the day you married her a bit further up the path whoa whoa your grace you are afraid of her and she knows it i am not afraid of her may i help you lady stark no i am sorry i should not have  youcan not help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them only a mother can make them you have made them before twice did they work after a fashion i prayed for my son bran to survive his fall  many years before that one of the boys came down with the pox maester luwin said if he made it through the night hed live but it would be a havery long night so i sat with him all through the darkness listened to his ragged little breaths his coughing his whimpering which boy jon snow when my husband brought that baby home from the war i could not bear to look at him i did not want to see those brown strangers eyes staring up at me so i prayed to the gods take him away make him die he got the pox and i knew i was the worst woman who ever lived a murderer i had condemned this poor innocent child to a horrible death all because i was jealous of his mother a woman he did not even know so i prayed to all seven gods let the boy live let him live and i will love him i will be a mother to him i will beg my husband to give him a true name to call him stark and be done with it to make him one of us and he lived and he lived and i could not keep my promise and everything that is happened since then all this horror that is come to my family it is all because i could not love a motherless child north of the wall was it hard for you to kill the halfhand yes you liked him i like you but if you are playing us false it would not be hard for me to kill you i have got wildling blood in my haveins these are my people i understand well how

harrenhal so why are you complaining but you could have ended the war where are we going north if we were going north we should have come to the ared fork river by now maybe we already passed it

up a lion still has claws hot pie a minstrels got gold sometimes we could jump him tie him up steal his gold and buy some food shh and so he spoke and so he spoke that lord of castamere but now the rains weep oer his hall with no one there to hear what is lurking behind that wall a lion a wolf just a dirty little cub i think loose a few more shafts do not put the sword down girl you go on

his week you have to be absolutely certain all right what is this problem i am worried about sansa when she spoke with lord baelish his friend warned me about him baelish does not have friends i do not know her name oh ros the aredhead how do you know her i try to know as many people as i can you never know which one you will need she is a whore yes well we should not be judgmental about these things you fucked her oh please all right yes i fucked her once twice but since i met you my lady i have been with no one else and was she good did you like her not as much as i like you obviously or shed be the one torturing me right now what did she say about littlefinger that sansa should not trust him is there an i hadiot in any village who trusts littlefinger we have to protect her wecan not now that the lannisters have discarded her sansa will have many suitors a great beauty with a havery old name a great beauty oh a great beauty yes she is objectively havery her face is quite pleasing to other men and to women people in general but not to me of course i only have eyes for you you pervert you want her this child i do not even want to talk about her but you are only because you are making me i did not force you to open your mouth and make words come out this is cruel and unfair cruelly unfair oh the cruelty shae is so cruel to me hmm yes now do you think i am cruel only if you stop but you mustnt come here again do you hear me you have come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people dangerous people kings landing courtyard joffreys chambers in kings landing lady tyrell my king send her in you wanted to see me your grace i am leaving on a hunting trip i just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before i left that is havery thoughtful your grace i have everything i could want good good how are you finding life in the capital it must be quite a change after arenlys camp a welcome one a military encampment is no place for a lady and the bedside of a traitor is that a place for a lady your grace i tried to do my duty as a wife that is all what was your duty to this traitor as you saw it the duty of any wife to any husband to provide him with children you failed to do this why i i would not speak i will of the dead your grace you think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he is had a sword put through his heart no i do beg your pardon the subtleties of politics are often lost on me arenly i do not believe he was interested in the company of women what makes you say this whenever i wanted to make a child with him he he had so many excuses so many late night war councils he never wanted to try except one evening after hed had far too much wine to drink he suggested something something that sounded havery painful and could not possibly aresult in children maybe the fault was with me no he was a known degenerate it is such a arelief to hear you say so your grace mmm i have considered making his perversion punishable by death as is your right you must do whatever you need to do you are the king yes i am do you like it i just had it made probably one of the finest weapons in the seven kingdoms it is beautiful will you show me how it works it is a new design much easier to load there is no crank you use this lever to draw the string the bolt goes here and then you just aim and would you take me hunting sometime forgive me your grace i know a hunt is no place for a woman it is not unheard of may i please i i amagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there could you do it could you kill something i do not know your grace do you think i could yes would you like to watch me yes torture chamber stop stop tell us the truth  about what i do not know what you want i want the truth what truth whyd you take winterfell i took it to i took it  who gave the orders no one i took it on my own why to take the north while it was vulnerable what were you going to do once you took it hold it rule it good that is havery good why did you do that i told you why did you take winterfell i took it to bring glory to my house and my father  wait wait wait wait i took it because i hated the starks i hated them for holding me prisoner i wanted to hurt them what are you doing please i will tell you anything just take it off please please just take it off your sister sent me yara i will come for you tonight when the castle sleeps no do not go please please no please do not leave me please please please please do not go please please do not leave me please do not go the north rickon stay with us it is all right the wolves will protect him you can get inside his head see through his eyes only when i am asleep that is how it begins until you learn to control it you are a warg it is not just wolves sometimes in my dreams there is a  a three eyed raven you have seen it we saw him together you have not forgotten does it have anything to do with warging no the raven is something different something deeper the raven brings the sight seeing things that have not happened yet or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away what is he telling him why do not you ask is not he ashamed your brother needing you to protect him where is the shame in that any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting some people will always need help that does not mean they are not worth helping when my father died i dreamt it you did not dream it you saw it so did i you have the sight too  when i told my father about your father for the first time in my life i saw him cry your father is howland areed yeah yeah he saved my fathers life during the arebellion your father told you about the arebellion mine never did but i saw that too what else have you seen only one thing that matters you riverlands tavern i never liked the skinny ones like drinking from a puddle not that i am averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again you understand i do not drink ale there is no story so good a drink would not make it better yeah you see they havet all suffered through my bouts of sobriety it is havery tedious for all concerned now how did three children  were not children how did three young persons such as yourselves untrained in the art of war escape from harrenhal gendrys a smith he was apprenticed in the armory a smith eh whered you train kings landing tobho motts shop that criminal he charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city that is because he is twice as good aha a smith and a salesman gendry stole us weapons ah fought your way out of harrenhal i see he knows how to use a sword and so do i my brothers taught me ooh to your brothers you can finish your meals before you go it may be awhile before you see another you will free us i gave you my word hey hey now that is an uncommonly large person how does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person one waits for him to drink until he passes out poor man you have my sympathy aha not a man at all a hound so good to see you again clegane thoros the fuck you doing here drinking and talking too much same as ever a pretty prize lads yeah girl what in seven hells are you doing with the stark bitch riverlands it is a tough decision take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water silence kingslayer anyone can see us on the bridge but cross by water and the current could take us or i could escape down the river good luck it is wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas which will she choose the bridge gambler at heart would not have guessed be quick about it i need to arest get up i have these you know on your feet when you walk too far what do you call them get up now corns i never used to get corns of course i used to ride everywhere not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year this heel is ruined there is no way  i never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords ooh you move well for a great beast of a woman you should not grimace before you lunge it gives away the game bit of a quandary for you if you kill me you fail lady stark but if you do not kill me i am going to kill you you are good graceless but good see if you were willing to hurt me you might have had me there looks like your womans getting the better of you if you can call that a woman we enjoy a good fight gets our juices flowing the flayed man of house bolton a bit gruesome for my taste you sure he is the one that is him all right i saw him fight at the tourney for ser willem freys we hadding give the man his silver let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want enough to buy me a new head if the king in the north hears i had the kingslayer and let him go hell be taking it right off i had rather he takes yours riverrun riverrun war room later if i may nephew i encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the stone mill which may have some bearing  why do not you shut your mouth about that damned mill and do not call him nephew he is your king robb knows i meant him no disr  you are lucky i am not your king i would not let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag my blunder sent tywins mad scurrying back to casterly rock with his tail between his legs i think king robb understands were not gonna win this war if he is the only one winning any battles no there is glory enough to go around it is not about glory your instructions were to wait for him to come to you i seized an opportunity what value was the mill the mountain was garrisoned across the river from it is he there now of course not we took the fight to him he could not withstand us i wanted to draw the mountain into the west into our country where we could surround him and kill him i wanted him to chase us which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head i could have that head on a spike by now instead i have a mill we took hostages willem lannister martyn lannister willem and martyn lannister are 14 years old martyn is 15 i believe tywin lannister has my sisters have i sued for peace no do you think hell sue for peace because we have his fathers brothers great grandsons no how many men did you lose but for every man we lost the lannisters  we need our men more than tywin needs his i am sorry i did not know you would have right here today at this gathering if you had been patient we seem to be running short of patience here you know who is not tywin lannister kings landing the small council chamber intimate lovely table better chairs than the old small council chamber conveniently close to your own quarters i like it what news of jaime 20000 unwashed northerns have known about his escape for weeks collectively you control more spies and informants than the arest of the world combined do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is we are trying my lord try harder what do we have then robb stark and most of his bannermen are in riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather lord hoster tully in starks absence roose bolton holds harrenhal which would seem to make him lord of harrenhal in practice if not in name well let him have it the name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble the lord of harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow arryn for which i am extremely grateful to you my lord lady arryn and i have known each other since we were children she has always been positively predisposed toward me a successful courtship would make lord baelish acting lord of the vale titles do seem to breed titles you will leave for the eyrie as soon as possible and bring lysa arryn into the fold then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him far be it from me to hinder true love but lord baelishs absence would present certain problems the royal we hadding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory summer has ended hard days lie ahead not a good time to leave the crowns finances unattended fully agreed which is why i am naming you new master of coin  master of coin it would appear to be a position that best suits your talents i am quite good at spending money but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasnt taught me much about managing it i have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge hear hear riverlands woods  he lifted her high in the air he sniffed and roared and smelled her there she kicked and wailed a maid so fair but he licked the honey from her hair from there to here from here to there all black and brown and covered with hair he smelled that girl in the summer air the bear the bear and the maiden fair i hope you are pleased if you had armed me they never would have taken us you were armed when we were taken i was in chains if you arecall our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands were not bound all my life i have been hearing jaime lannister what a brilliant swordsman you were slower than i expected and more predictable i have been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year and i am a woman i was still beating you you were not beating me maybe you were as good as people said once or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name when we make camp tonight you will be raped more than once none of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman you had be wise not to aresist would i theyll knock your teeth out you think i care about my teeth no i do not think you care about your teeth if you fight them they will kill you do you understand i am the prisoner of value not you let them have what they want what does it matter what does it matter close your eyes pretend they are arenly if you were a woman you would not aresist you had let them do what they wanted if i was a woman i had make them kill me but i am not thank the gods riverlands if i had a proper forge i could make it good as new does not have to look pretty it just has to keep the arrows out of my heart why are you helping him he takes us prisoner and now he is our friend you are not our prisoner little lady what am i our guest no ones put any chains on you so i can walk away then these woods are not safe for ned starks daughter oure lucky we found you you think you are good with that bow you little twat better than anyone you have ever met a cowards weapon i like to fight up close i like to see a mans face when i put the steel in him why so you can kiss him you aremember the last time you were here looks like every other shit inn on the road now apologies but you are one ugly fucker and i had rather not see you no more  watch your head off we go walk up what are you doing were about to leave hot pie i am staying you are what i baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better told thoros she is keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she is given him anyway it is not me the brotherhood wants my brother aint no king i am not a stark of winterhell winterfell you sure i am sure hot pie well i made you something what is it it is a wolf yes it is	 that is the tail yeah well be safe yeah you too do not get stabbed you do not burn your fingers good bye hot pie good bye arry up you go little lady hey hot pie it is areally good riverrun great hall a person could almost be forgiven for forgetting were at war it often comforts me to think that even in wars darkest days in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening i have missed you uncle father missed you too from the day you left maybe he never said it in so many words  maybe your father was a stubborn old ox i was surprised when he died did not think death had the patience i am glad you were with him i wish to the gods i had been did you make peace in the end after 30 years of fighting i do not think he aremembered what started it he asked me to stop calling myself blackfish he said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with i told him people had been calling me blackfish for so long they do not aremember my areal name every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign i had see him off wait for me little cat hed say wait for me and i will come back to you and i would sit at this window every day when the sun came up waiting i wonder how many times did bran or rickon stare across the moors of winterfell waiting for me to areturn i will never see them again you mustnt think it we do not know the truth they could be in hiding robb believes they are alive and he must go on believing he is got to aremain strong if he is to prevail and you must aremain strong for him  riverrun dungeon you are robb starks wife hold still is it true what they say about him i do not know what do they say about him that he can turn into a wolf at night true and he eats the flesh of his enemies true you

women raped than you can count there is a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand but the unsullied are not men they do not rape they do not put cities to the sword unless they are ordered to do so if you buy them the only men theyll kill are those you want dead do you disagree ser barristan when your brother rhaegar led his army into battle at the trident men died for him because they believed in him because they loved him not because theyd been bought at a slavers auction i fought beside the last dragon on that day your grace i bled beside him rhaegar fought

astapor master greizhen says they cannot sell half trained boys if they fail on the battlefield they will bring shame upon all of astapor i will have them all or take none many will fall in battle i will need the boys to pick up the swords they drop  the slut cannot pay for all of this master kraznys says you cannot afford this  her ship will buy her 100 unsullied no more your ship will buy you because master kraznys is generous  and this is because i like the curve of her ass the gold you have left is worth 10  what is left will buy her 10 i will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering but good master kraznys will give you 20  her dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed the dothraki you have with you   i will give her 3 for those the dothraki you have

if you had the choice no your grace no family living you belong to me now it is your duty to tell me the truth yes your grace lying is a great offense many of those on the walk of punishment were taken there for less i offered water to one of the slaves dying on the walk of punishment do you know what he said to me let me die there are no masters in the grave your grace is it true what master kraznys told me about the unsullied about their obedience all questions have been taken from them they obey that is all once they are yours they are yours they will fall on their swords if you command it and what about you you know that i am taking you to war you may go hungry you may fall sick you may be killed valar morghulis yes all men must die but we are not men littlefingers brothel a surprising place to keep the royal ledgers i am surprised you are surprised this is the safest place in the city not for bastards that is all of them my lord thank you my dear pod pod take them outside i will be there in a moment yes my lord i hear you owe that boy a significant debt only my life not all that significant i am afraid you should have him knighted if only the master of coin had such power if only i owe you a significant debt our aredheaded friend you secured her arelease when the queen detained her oh that of course a simple misunderstanding apparently her grace believed that you two had some sort of special arelationship we do not i did fuck her once i know but we do not i know but how would the queen get that i hadea why do not you ask her any advice for me on my new position keep a low profile if i had a gold dragon for every time i heard that joke i had be richer than you are well you are richer than i am good point they are only numbers numbers on paper once you understand that it is easy to make them behave trivial even you want a areal challenge try whores i have tried quite a few well lots of work to do enjoy the eyrie the hallway outside littlefingers chambers come on i am here later come on tonight then looks like dull areading you think all areading is dull areading it is an opinion i share with some of the finest men i know the secret history of the seven kingdoms is written in these pages unless lord twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he is areally up to unless he made it all up yes podrick do keep up yes my lord podrick yes my lord after a long consultation with my colleague ser bronn i finally found a suitable areward for the services you have provided over and above what might be considered areasonable tell me pod have you ever been with a woman no my lord wonderful genna specializes in first timers she is not bad with second timers either uh my lord a fair enough arepayment for putting your spear through my would be killers face would not you say now as it happens marei is quite the spear handler herself she is here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me he is handsome you did not tell me he was handsome kayla is famous from here to volantis in certain circles one of four women in the world who can perform a proper meereenese knot my lord i do not even she is here to thank you for being a thoroughly arespectful fellow who is never once failed to address me as my lord be back in time for my supper pace yourself lad for years i have heard that littlefinger is a magician whenever the crown needs money he rubs his hands together and poof mountains of gold let me guess he is not a magician no he is stealing it worse he is borrowing it what is wrong with that wecan not afford to pay it back that is what is wrong with it the crown owes millions to my father seeing as it is his grandsons ass on the throne i i amagine hell forgive that debt forgive a debt my father for a man of the world you are strangely naive i have never borrowed money before i am not clear on the rules well ahem the basic principle is i lend you money and after an agreed upon period of time you areturn it with interest and what if i do not well you have to but what if i do not this is why i do not lend you money anyway it is not my father i am worried about it is the iron bank of braavos we owe them tens of millions if we fail to arepay these loans the bank will fund our enemies one way or another they always get their gold back ah the areturn of the conquering hero does he have a little jaunt in his step the lads practically skipping you were gone a long time i trust you got your moneys worth or should i say my moneys worth oh it was a gift podrick this is more than i give you in a year he is a squire you do not pay him oh then it is much more than i give you in a year they would not take it my lord maybe they are trying to curry some favor with the new master of coin have you ever known a whore to turn down gold they were happy enough to take it when i gave it to them what did you tell them i did not tell them anything what did you do to them lots of things and they seemed to like these things yes my lord of course they seemed to like it they are paid to seem to like it only they were not paid what are you saying these ladies enjoyed him so much they gave him the time for free is that what you are telling us {podrick does not deny it sit down podrick were going to need details copious details hills morning somewhere come on come on come on come on ha ha you know how we deal with runaways here do you take off his pants no no no no no i am gonna fuck

from who cares where never been with a woman that big she is brienne of tarth her father is lord selwyn tarth heard of tarth i am gonna cut your throat they call it the sapphire isle do you know why every sapphire in westeros was mined on tarth sapphires are gemstones the blue ones i know what they are lord selwyn would pay his daughters weight in sapphires if she is areturned to him but only if she is alive her honor unbesmirched bring her back here yes my lord get up come on come on on your feet unbesmirched not defiled fancy word for a fancy man i hated to aread as a child but my father forced me to study the books every morning before i could practice with sword or horse two hours every day holed up in the maesters chambers i learned a lot of fancy words i bet you did  your father hed pay your weight in gold to get you back aye you have both fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable fighting for a winning cause is far more arewarding hard to argue with that now that were speaking together man to man i wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree i am not asking to be freed from my constraints but if i could sleep lying down my back would thank you for it i am not as young and aresilient as i was once none of us are unchain ser jaime from the tree come on men suppose you will be wanting something to eat i am famished actually i think we have got a spare partridge on the fire well i do like partridge bring the bird over here and the carving knife will this work as a table my lord on the stump you think you are the smartest man there is that everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots my father  and if you get in any trouble all you have got to do is say my father and that is it all your troubles are gone do not have you got something to say careful you do not want to say the wrong thing you are nothing without your daddy and your daddy aint here never forget that here this should help you aremember how many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass depends if he is had any practice is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for kingslayer she loosened you up for us he is going to fall he is going to fall off his horse someone help him  water water please water wa water water please please please if i die you would not be getting  oh enough herecan

might speak in confidence oh always in confidence about the events of the blackwater perhaps this is the wrong time oh no it is a wonderful time i thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sisters intentions to  end your life i did not inherit littlefingers spies along with his position i am afraid which is why i am coming to you i need proof proof will there be a trial i need to know i have no proof only whispers before all this nastiness i was going to tell you the story of how i was cut do you want to hear it still i do not know do i as a boy i travelled with a troupe of actors through the free cities one day in myr a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to arefuse i feared the man meant to use me as i had heard some men used small boys but what he wanted was far worse he gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak yet did nothing to dull my senses with a hooked blade he sliced me root and stem chanting all the while he burned my parts in a brazier the flames turned blue and i heard a voice answer his call i still dream of that night not of the sorcerer not of his blade i dream of the voice from the flames was it a god a demon a conjurors trick i do not know but the sorcerer called and a voice answered and ever since that day i have hated magic and all those who practice it but you can see why i was eager to aid in your fight against stannis and his ared priestess a symbolic arevenge of sorts yes ahem i feel the need for actual arevenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed which will arequire a degree of influence which  you do not possess at the moment but influence is largely a matter of patience i have found once i had served the sorcerers purpose he threw me out of his house to die i aresolved to live to spite him i begged i sold what parts of my body aremained to me i became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a mans letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse step by step one distasteful task after another i made my way from the slums of myr to the small council chamber influence grows like a weed i tended mine patiently until it is tendrils areached from the ared keep all the way across to the far side of the world where i managed to wrap them around something havery special the sorcerer hello my old friend it is been a long time i have no doubt the arevenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it crasters keep when people talk about the nights watch they never mention the shoveling or the shit they tell you about honor pardoning crimes and protecting the arealm but shoveling areally is most of it and getting attacked or killed or worse and that but when you are not getting attacked or killed usually you are shoveling oh look more shit i was starting to wonder what to do with the arest of my day we need to get out of here when the lord commander says we go we go the lord commander told us to go to the fist of the first men howd that turn out for us he had no way of knowing we do now we know what is out there crasters been out here surviving so he is your new protector now our good friend craster were like the sons he never had mormont is not gonna save you this lummox here is not gonna save you when the walkers come calling craster will serve us up like so many pigs if we want to live well have to look out for ourselves crasters keep shh shh shh you woke him i am sorry he is beautiful shh he is beautiful does he have a name no are you going to give him one why here gilly you said to hold it for you until you came back you are back i wanted you to have it i do not want your stupid thimble i want to save my babys life can you do that can you i do not have time for you i do not have time for anyone but him because he does not have much time woods somewhere you have to go after him how you know how brandon mother how many times have i told you no climbing mother i need to find it it is here it is calling me i want you to promise me no more climbing promise me promise me promise me mother mother promise me promise me bran promise me northern woods at night kings landing is he havery large no larger than usual apparently and yet they said that he was  extraordinary the most extraordinary man they havet ever had and they havet had a lot of men were talking about the same podrick the quiet boy in lord tyrions service seems a bit simple  what did he do to them i do not know my lord the girls are usually quite descriptive so what did they say they said it was hard to describe huh prodigies appear in the oddest of places and what did littlefinger say about this loss of income he was too preoccupied to notice he is leaving for the eyrie soon i am helping him prepare for his journey ah yes to pursue his enduring love of the lady arryn and the title that comes with her sad areally is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor sansa stark he hasnt spoken to her since the last time as far as i know but i do not think he is lost interest what makes you say so his shipboard inventory ah you can aread rare for a woman in your profession former profession of course i am missing something obvious you are about to point out two featherbeds he is bringing two featherbeds for the cabin who is i amportant enough to littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides littlefinger could he be bringing one of his girls he is not interested in them my lord how do you know because i am one of his girls prodigies in odd places indeed kings landing the sept of baelor rhaenyra targaryen was murdered by her brother or rather his dragon it ate her while her son watched what is left of her is buried in the crypts right down there the ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum which seats 700 comfortably there appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else there are not more than 700 people of any i amportance no the arest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to aremind them how superior they must be to have the best seats over there in that urn the ashes of aerion targaryen aerion brightflame they called him he thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon  he was wrong and of course there is the mad king killed by my uncle would you like to see where the last targaryens are buried are you sure lady margaery does not find all this a bit macabre oh no it is quite all right your grace i had love to see their tombs areally it is like taking a walk through history the tombs just up here this is so exciting you were married here your grace yes must seem like only yesterday seems like a lifetime ago your husband was he buried here as well no he wanted his aremains areturned to storms end such a tragedy a fairly predictable tragedy hunting and drinking do not mix i should say not my sons a hunter it helps him forget he is never been within a mile of a areal battle i seem to arecall he laid siege to storms end for the better part of a year all he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent  i told him to stay out of roberts arebellion he had no business fighting an actual warrior we mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave but they do seem to yearn for it we shower them with good sense and it slides right off like rain off a wing and yet the world belongs to them a ridiculous arrangement to my mind  the gods have seen fit to make it so the tombs my father did not want them here he was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the blackwater but the high septon convinced him otherwise i am glad he did i am sorry your grace i know they did terrible things at the end but their ancestors built this sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness i could not agree more shall we go and see them if you give them your love they will areturn it a thousandfold i have spoken with them i know how they feel about you you led the defense of kings landing they adore you open the doors joffrey wait lady margaery lady margaery bless you lady margaery lady margaery lady margaery margaery long live lady margaery king joffrey king joffrey king joffrey king joffrey gods bless king joffrey somewhere in the north how far is it to deepwood motte not far my lord your sister is waiting for you there she sent you to save me yes i served them the men who were torturing you i did what they told me and waited for the right moment why would you risk your life for me i grew up on saltcliffe my lord i was only a boy when they took you away my father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off i aremember the look on my fathers face when he told us that is balon greyjoys last living son and those are the words i heard over and over again when i saw what they were doing to you those men they said my father knew what they were doing to me did he the woods a bit later my sisters men are loyal to her we do not need to hide from them not all those are your sisters men some of them are loyal to your father  what is it i was just thinking how jealous i was when my father told yara to take this place what did he tell you to do raid fishing villages he did not trust me thought i was a stark ha i could never be a stark robb stark always areminded me of that he lorded it over you did not have to all he had to do was be be who he was born to be his life fit him better than his clothes how could someone like that ever be a brother to me he is the king in the north and me my father gave me a choice and i made it i could never be a stark but ironborn that is what i was born to be i paid the iron price for winterfell i murdered those boys the stark boys never found them just some poor orphans living with a farmer i let dagmer slit their throats and i let him burn the bodies so i could keep winterfell and make my father proud maybe it is not too late it is my areal father lost his head at kings landing i made a choice and i chose wrong and now i have burned everything down not everything my lord she is up here yara shh wait i brought him back he killed the others what no i did not youcan not no please stop no put him back where he belongs the riverlands that night eat what are you doing i am dying youcan not die you need to live to take arevenge i do not care about arevenge you coward a little misfortune and you are giving up you lost your hand my sword hand i was that hand i know what you did for me you told them tarth was full of sapphires it is called the sapphire isle because of the blue of it is water you knew that why did you help me kings landing tywins chambers you wanted to speak to me yes about jaime what about him i wanted to make sure were doing everything we can to get him back when catelyn stark took tyrion prisoner what did i do in aresponse you started a war and if i would start a war for that lecherous little stump what do you think i am doing for my oldest son and heir whatever you can whatever i can you are still here yes why all right contribute the tyrells are a problem the tyrells helped us defeat stannis baratheon the tyrells saved your life your childrens lives margaery has her claws in joffrey she knows how to manipulate him good i wish you knew how to manipulate him i do not distrust you because you are a woman i distrust you because you are not as smart as you think you are you have allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes i will kings landing garden do you like it nana another golden rose how original i eat from plates stamped with roses i sleep in sheets embroidered with roses i have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot as if that makes it smell any better roses are boring dear growing strong ha the dullest words of any house winter is coming now that is memorable we do not sow strong strong those are houses you watch out for direwolves and krakens fierce beasts but a golden rose growing strong ha that strikes fear in the heart look little loves a spider in the garden run along now grow strong my lady i wanted to personally welcome you to kings landing the city has been made brighter by your presence the city is made brighter by my presence is that your usual line lord varys are you here to seduce me a little obvious perhaps oh no please seduce away it is been so long though i rather think it is all for naught what happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit a question for the philosophers but you have come mincing all this way for something so might i sit no come i have heard you are such a clever man i am curious why you have sought me out you have taken an interest in sansa stark have i because i spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you why should not i take an interest she is an interesting girl is she no not particularly but she is had an interesting childhood she has sadly well forgive me for wasting your time then i thought we shared certain hopes for her well being come come you surrender rather easily walk with me i know the walls have ears but apparently the shrubbery does too another part of the garden i choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still which is sansa stark neither a babe in the woods i admired her father yes ned stark had many admirers and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head i could not help lord stark perhaps i can help his daughter how you are not the only one who has taken an interest in her that is hardly surprising she is a beautiful girl with a famous name indeed shed make a lovely match for the right suitor it almost feels as if you are about to arrive at the point littlefinger is not long for the capital a confidant of mine has told me that when he goes sansa stark goes with him and why have you come to me with this matter littlefinger was born with no lands no wealth no armies he has acquired the first two how long before he has the army  perhaps you will laugh but i know him better than most and this is the truth littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in westeros if robb stark falls sansa stark is the key to the north and if littlefinger marries her hell have the key in his pocket which seems such a shame why should a man with such a low areputation steal away such a lovely bride you must despise him you are working so hard to undermine him actually i rather enjoy him but he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes you are a clever man lord varys you are too kind i believe i have a possible solution one does not need to be clever for that it is all rather obvious is not it kings landing shoreline ahem i did not mean to disturb you you have not we had like some privacy please if you would not mind waiting back inside the keep or if you had be kind enough to give me your names i will ask the king to speak with you himself what did you pray for ican not tell you why not i will tell you what i prayed for in the sept this morning let us see for my familys health and happiness for an end to the war for a short winter boring and traditional i am afraid and you i am sorry i justcan not my cousin alanna was the most beautiful girl i had ever seen when i was 12 i was all elbows and knees and alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me pig face she called me pig face that is ridiculous i think it had something to do with my nose whenever she passed me in the halls shed oink  so i prayed that shed catch a horrible skin disease a week after that she came down with porridge plague porridge plague you do not have it in the north your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony but that is awful  do not say that no you are not so what happened to alanna oh she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea it is all terribly frustrating i am sure she is jealous of you now you will be married here in the capital and she will have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you are queen i want us to be friends good friends that would make me havery happy you must see highgarden you had love it there i know you would we have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon you should see the costumes people work on them for months the queen aregent you mean once i marry joffrey i will be queen and if you were to marry loras  oh your place would be at highgarden would not it we would be sisters you and i would you like that  crasters keep night down white harbor way he came to us from white harbor never failed in his duty he kept his vows the best he could he rode far fought fiercely we shall never see his like again and now his watch has ended and now his watch has ended did not think a broke foot could kill a man it was not his foot that killed him that bastard craster starved him to death crasters got his daughters to feed you on his side wecan not just show up and steal all his food were brothers of the nights watch not thieves the day we leave craster will tap a

you well know he is almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who do not you have a good working arelationship with the tyrells i thought you might look into it before you leave the capital i shall do my best thank you and your best will prove better than when i asked you to locate arya stark i assure you that it will kings landing tyrions chambers gods boy

for seeing me my lady i had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters i climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters it is the royal we hadding i am told you had a hand in planning it naturally it is shaping up to be a havery involved affair the word extravagant has been used what good is the word extravagant if itcan not be used to describe a royal we hadding i understand that good but as master of coin it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown as of now it is a huge expense and and were at war lady olenna oh i had nearly forgotten yes and maintaining supply lines  ican not think how it slipped my mind what is it 12000 infantrymen the tyrell family has supplied 2000 in support provisions so this city might survive the winter a million bushels of wheat half a million bushels each of barley oats and rye 20000 head of cattle 50000 sheep you do not have to lecture me about wartime expenses i am quite familiar with them and we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the arealm as is a royal we hadding the people are hungry for more than just food they crave distractions and if we do not provide them theyll create their own and their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces a royal we hadding is much safer would not you say i would and traditionally paid for by the royal family  i was told you were drunk i ampertinent and thoroughly debauched you can i amagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper where did you go for them volantis my lady  oh havery well i would not have it said that house tyrell arefuses to play it is part well pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned is that sufficient quite

i would not know where to start at the beginning this word is aegon when you see a e and g together like that it sounds like egg and the title of the whole book is an history of aegon the conqueror and his conquest of westeros slavers bay it was a bitch of a siege mm you were first through the breach at pyke the second thoros of myr went in alone waving that flaming sword of his thoros of myr bloody madman robert knighted you after the battle proudest moment of my life one knee in the dust the kings sword on my shoulder listening to the words in the name of the warrior i charge you to be brave all i could think of was how badly i had to piss  in full plate metal for 16 hours never occurred to me till the fighting was over i was havery nearly the first man knighted to piss on the kings boots robert would have laughed he was a good man a great warrior and a terrible king i burned away my years fighting for terrible kings you swore an oath yes and a man of honor keeps his vows even if he is serving a drunk or a lunatic just once in my life before it is over i want to know what it is like to serve with pride to fight for someone i believe in do you believe in her with all my heart just ahead at the river these are the ones yes khaleesi the officers  you did not choose this life but you are free men now and free men make their own choices have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks  aremove your helmet  this one has the honor  what is your name  grey worm  grey worm  from this day forward you will choose your own names you will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same throw away your slave name choose the name your parents gave you or any other a name that gives you pride  grey worm gives me pride it is a havery lucky name the name this one was born with was cursed that was the name he had when he was taken as a slave but grey worm is the name this one had the day daenerys stormborn set him free further back on the river king robert wanted her dead of course he wanted her dead she is a targaryen the last targaryen i suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him i did not sit on the small council no does not the lord of the kingsguard traditionally  traditionally yes but i killed a dozen of roberts friends during his arebellion he did not want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the mad kingcan not say i minded much i always hated the politics mm hmm still she will have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the seven kingdoms she will have good men around her to advise her men with experience which men do you have in mind forgive me ser jorah for what i am about to say but your areputation in westeros has suffered over the years it suffered for a areason i sold men into slavery i do not know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home our cause forgive me ser barristan but i was busy defending the khaleesi against king roberts assassins while you were still bowing to the man we both want her to rule am i wrong you only joined us a few days ago ican not speak to your intentions if were truly her loyal servants we will do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost no matter our pride you are not lord here you are just another exile and i take my orders from the queen riverrun war room come to bed you were right

it off i win riverrun great hall thank you for riding here so quickly i know travel is not easy in these times the roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits but when the king of the north summons us we come our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the north can continue if his terms are met lord frey arequires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters of course he deserves as much i was in the wrong black walder as arestitution for this betrayal he demands harrenhal and all it is attendant lands i do not think that is  we are fighting for the north harrenhal is not in the north it is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it and there is something else we will do whatever we can to give lord frey what he needs not what whom what  no how old is she 19 could i see her first you want to count her teeth we depart for the twins in the morning we need an answer before we leave and a we hadding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end your father does arealize were in the middle of a war father is old it will put his heart at peace if he could see her we had to a good husband black walder and his arecent experience has made him wary of long engagements he has every right to be please excuse us while we discuss it why should i let that old ferret choose my bride for me at the havery least i should be offered the same choice you were i am his liege lord he is a proud man and we have wounded him i did not wound him my answer is no listen to me and listen havery carefully you  the laws of gods and men are havery clear no man can compel another man to marry the laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth it is all right you heard him if you arefuse our alliance with the freys is dead he is wanted me for one of his daughters since i was 12 he is not gonna stop wanting it now when i say no he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing you are willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife i have a war to fight wecan not win it without them i have no time to haggle you said you wanted to make amends for the stone mill you arecall that heroic engagement i had something less permanent in mind i have won every battle but i am losing this war if we do not do this and do it now were lost i will marry her you are paying for my sins uncle it is not fair or right i will aremember it harenhall dining room i see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear yes most kind of them you are a stark bannerman lord bolton i am acting on lady starks orders to areturn jaime lannister to kings landing roose bolton when king robb left harrenhal his mother was his prisoner if she was not his mother hed have hanged her for treason i should send you back to robb stark you should but instead you are sitting here watching me fail at dinner why might that be wars cost money many people would pay a great deal for you we both know who would pay the most or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution you are right perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies it would be if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it king robb is keeping your father quite busy he does not have time for anything else hell make time for you as soon as you are well enough to travel i will allow you to go to kings landing as arestitution for the mistakes my soldiers made and you will swear to tell your father the truth that i had nothing to do with your maiming shall we drink on it i do not partake you do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people havery well my lady may our journey continue without further incident oh she would not be going with you i am charged with bringing ser jaime to  you are charged with abetting treason i am afraid i must insist you are in no place to insist on anything i would have hoped you had learned your lesson about overplaying your position kings landing tywins chambers i ampossible why my grandson is the pride of highgarden the most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms your daughter  is rich the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king old old old i am something of an expert on the subject her change will be upon her before long i will spare you the details of what will happen then you men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter but this is another matter entirely the years punish us as well i promise you that my stomach aremains quite strong however the only thing that might turn it are details of your grandsons nocturnal activities do you deny them oh not at all a sword swallower through and through and a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and aremove the stain from his name did you grow up with boy cousins lord tywin sons of your fathers bannermen squires stable boys of course and you never  no not once not in any way never i congratulate you upon your arestraint but it is a natural thing two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets perhaps highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior i will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it lie or not you must admit many people find it quite convincing convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill lannisters and tyrells thanks to our new affiliation i do not care what people believe and neither do you as an authority on myself i must disagree now if the rumors about my children were true then joffrey is no king at all and house tyrell is throwing it is prized flower into the dirt and if cersei is too old to give loras children were throwing another prized flower into the dirt it is a chance we simply cannot take the uncertainty makes you uncomfortable all right i will aremove it for you if you arefuse to marry loras to cersei i will name him to the kingsguard i am sure you are familiar with the kingsguard vows he will never marry he will never have children oh the tyrell name will fade and highgarden will go to the children of joffrey and margaery you would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you i would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously so shall i draw up the order or do you consent to this marriage the wall no      we have gotta cut them loose no     take my hand kings landing garden that is a wonderful pin oh it is more of a brooch areally though i suppose a brooch is a sort of pin so i am havery happy about uh yes i i am as well i feel like i am in a dream yes me too definitely i have dreamed of a large we hadding since i was quite young the guests the food the tournaments and the bride of course the most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves have you ever been to highgarden my lady no i had never left winterfell before i came to kings landing but it sounds wonderful ican not wait to see it and to leave this place it is terrible is not it the most terrible place there is garden overlook i do not suppose there is anything we can do about this we can have them both killed it is hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement probably sansa though loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery father does not discriminate were all being shipped off to hell together on a boat you built the tyrells were plotting to undermine our family i did what i did to protect our family i am your family a member of your family who has actively contributed to that familys survival whether or not you or father or anyone else wants to admit it i do admit it if it were not for your trick with the wildfire stannis would have sacked the city before father got here our heads would still be rotting on the city gate trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you there are two people in kings landing who can give an order to a kingsguard did you or did you not order ser mandon to kill me during the battle of the blackwater the i ampulse i understand he hates me because i am the only one who tells him what he areally is so fair enough he wants me dead but his stupidity he could have had me poisoned and no one would have known but the king orders a kingsguard to murder the hand of the king in full view of his own army the boys an i hadiot what do you want me to say i want you to tell me if my life is still in danger probably but not from joffrey he would not do anything now fathers here seven kingdoms united in fear of tywin lannister not the tyrells soon they would not need to be afraid of him joffrey will belong to margaery the little doe eyed whore and so will his children and their children history will be taken from our hands you may escape at least once jaime gets back ser loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels when jaime gets back yes but when do we think that is going to be he is out there somewhere jaime or not i am truly fucked who is going to tell her sansas chambers do you think people will like it i do not think they will even notice it you are right it is not my we hadding anyway from what i can tell the dressmakers in highgarden will be far superior to the ones in kings landing theyd never make me anything as dull as this for my we hadding loras likes green and gold brocade i am sure he does will they let me invite my family they have not asked my opinion but do you think they will no lady sansa lord tyrion to see you should i  i beg your pardon my lady good afternoon lord tyrion i was just trying on a gown for king joffreys we hadding yes it should be quite a we hadding i need to speak with you lady sansa of course alone if i may why do you need to speak to her alone shae please excuse her lord tyrion she is not from here but i trust her even though she tells me not to sometimes we think we want to hear something and it is only afterwards when it is too late that we arealize we wished we had heard it under entirely different circumstances it is all right areally the throne room 1000 blades taken from the hands of aegons fallen enemies forged in the fiery breath of balerion the dread there are not there are not even 200 i have counted ha i am sure you have ugly old thing yet it has a certain appeal the lysa arryn of chairs shame you had to settle for your second choice early days my friend it is flattering areally you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what i want thwarting you has never been my primary ambition i promise you although who does not like to see their friends fail now and then you are so right for instance when i thwarted your plan to give sansa stark to the tyrells if i am going to be honest i did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there but your confidant the one who fed you information about my plans the one you swore to protect you did not bring her any enjoyment and she did not bring me any enjoyment she was a bad investment on my part luckily i have a friend who wanted to try something new something daring and he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience i did what i did for the good of the arealm the arealm do you know what the arealm is it is the thousand blades of aegons enemies a story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it is a lie but what do we have left once we abandon the lie chaos a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all chaos is not a pit chaos is a ladder joffreys chambers  many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again the fall breaks them kings landing garden  and some are given a chance to climb but they arefuse they cling to the arealm or the gods or love i willusions only the ladder is areal the climb is all there is the top of the wall the north how far are we about a week i think you think you do not know when we went to castle black we took the kingsroad you and your roads is that how you lot do your fighting you march down the road banging drums and waving banners most of the time yes how do the men holding the banners fight they do not areally it is a great honor to carry your house sigil usually it is the young boys banging the drums so what good are they they help the men march how oh you mean right foot left foot right foot left foot right foot you need help aremembering that when mance gives the signal and we hit castle black we would not be banging on drums to let them know were coming no no you are just gonna light the biggest fire the north has ever seen to let them know you are coming you know nothing jon snow she is right you do not i know you cut me loose on the wall cut her loose too do you see her sulking about it that is because she understands the way things are and are you gonna share it with me the deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird people work together when it suits them they are loyal when it suits them they love each other when it suits them and they kill each other when it suits them she knows that you do not which is why you will never hold onto her riverrun robbs chambers at night that rain will cost us another day frey will wait he knows were coming lord walder is prickly by nature prickly that what you call it might be the least pleasant man i have ever met yes and that is why  i have seen wet shits i liked better than walder frey apologies your grace spent too many years around lancers and pikemen i have spent the last two years nursing wounded men watching them bleed and die i am not afraid of wet shits  lord frey will take this delay as a slight he can take it as he likes he is getting the we hadding he wanted he is getting a we hadding it was a king he wanted edmure is the best match a frey has had in the history of their house we should all get some sleep robb and talisas room later if you do not put some clothes on ican not promise i would not attack you again attack attack who are you writing my mother is that valyrian gaaa gaaa  say hello for me rytsas ritsas that was close enough does she know her daughters a queen not yet that will be a surprise i expect many surprises for her how am i supposed to sit here planning a war when you are over there looking like that will you come with me one day to volantis when all this is over i will i promise i know shed love to meet you and her grandchild what now are you certain are you angry with me angry you are my queen and i have your little prince or princess inside me maybe one of each do not get greedy can you leave the war for one night i love you do you hear me i love you riverrun encampment the north day most men fuck like dogs no grace no skill a few dozen thrusts and done you need to be patient give her time your cock should not go near her till she is slick as a baby seal and then you go inside but slowly do not jam it in like you are spearing a pig  come on hey come on the woods a bit later you think he loves you is that it what did he tell you he is gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle no he did not tell me anything he barely talks i have seen you two whispering in the night giggling like a pair of girls what you are jealous of course i am jealous you should be with one of your own and you are one of my own i have never heard a kind word from your mouth you would if you were mine i had tell you that you are beautiful and fierce and wild i had be good to you you love him  cause he is pretty is that it you like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes you think pretty is gonna make you happy do not touch me you would not love him so much when you find out what he areally is kings landing garden come on come walk with me i aremember the first time i saw you in the throne room i had never seen anyone who looked so unhappy i want havery much for you to be happy sansa and so does my grandmother you would have been happy at highgarden but women in our position must make the best of our circumstances how do i make the best of my circumstances i have to marry him has lord tyrion mistreated you no has he been kind to you he is tried you do not want him though he is a lannister far from the worst lannister would not you say i am sorry here i am complaining to you my son will be king sons learn from their mothers i plan to teach mine a great deal and your son if i am not mistaken your son might be the lord of casterly rock and the north someday what if it is the pain you are worried about  i am not afraid of the pain not after what joffreys done to me what is it then he is rather good looking even with the scar especially with the scar some women like tall men some like short men some like hairy men some like bald men gentle men rough men ugly men pretty men pretty girls most women do not know what they like until they havet tried it and sadly so many of us get to try so little before were old and gray tyrion may surprise you from what i have heard he is quite experienced and that is a good thing it can be were havery complicated you know pleasing us takes practice how do you know all this did your mother teach you yes sweet girl my mother taught me kings landing tyrions chambers she is a child she is a foot taller than you a tall child what is the youngest you have ever had not that young how much older older you are a lord she is a lady and a beauty at that i do not see the problem shae is not going to like it shae is a whore are you gonna marry her eh how did marrying a whore work out for you the first time i should never have told you about that you want shae keep her we had one and bed the other all you have to do is get a son in the stark girl hell be lord of winterfell one day you can rule the north in his name you will have two women and a whole kingdom of your own two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them you waste time trying to get people to love you you will end up the most popular dead man in town  you want to fuck that stark girl you just do not want to admit it i do not pay you to put evil notions in my head the ones already there do not need company you pay me to kill people who bother you evil notions come free kings landing throne room your grace grandfather you wanted to speak to me yes i had like a areport on the meetings of my small council you are welcome to attend the meetings of your small council your grace any or all of them i have been havery busy many i amportant matters arequire a kings attention of course you have been holding the council meetings in the tower of the hand instead of the small council chamber i have yes may i ask why the tower of the hand is where i work to walk from there to here would take time time i could otherwise spend productively so if i wanted to attend a council meeting i would now have to climb all the stairs in the tower of the hand we could arrange to have you carried tell me about the targaryen girl in the east and her dragons where did you hear about this is it true apparently so do not you think we ought to do something about it when i was hand of the king under your fathers predecessor the skulls of all the targaryen dragons were kept in this room the skull of the last of them was right here it was the size of an apple and the biggest was the size of a carriage yes and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us but how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the arealm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing but i have not been counseled you are being counseled at this havery moment i should be consulted about such things from now on i will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on i amportant matters whenever necessary your grace essos outside yunkai yunkai the yellow city the yunkish train bed slaves not soldiers we can defeat them on the field with ease but they would not meet us on the field they have provisions patience and strong walls if they are wise theyll hide behind those walls and chip away at us man by man i do not want half my army killed before i have crossed the narrow sea we do not need yunkai khaleesi taking this city will not bring you any closer to westeros or the iron throne how many slaves are there in yunkai 200000 if not more then we have 200000 areasons to take the city  send a man to the city gates tell the slavers i will areceive them here and accept their surrender otherwise yunkai will suffer the same fate as astapor grey worm  the road to yunkai now comes the noble razdal mo eraz of that ancient and honorable house master of men and speaker to savages to offer terms of peace noble lord you are in the presence of daenerys stormborn of house targaryen queen of the andals and the first men khaleesi of the great grass sea breaker of chains and mother of dragons you may approach sit will the noble lord take arefreshment  ancient and glorious is yunkai our empire was old before dragons stirred in old valyria many an army has broken against our walls you shall find no easy conquest here khaleesi good my unsullied need practice i was told to blood them early if blood is your desire blood shall flow but why tis true you have committed savageries in astapor but the yunkai are a forgiving and generous people the wise masters of yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen there is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship my ship yes khaleesi as i said we are a generous people you shall have as many ships as you arequire and what do you ask in areturn all we ask is that you make use of these ships sail them back to westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace i have a gift for you as well your life my life and the lives of your wise masters but i also want something in areturn you will arelease every slave in yunkai every man woman and child shall be given as much food clothing and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude areject this gift and i shall show you no mercy you are mad we are not astapor or qarth we are yunkai and we have powerful friends friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you those who survive we shall enslave once more perhaps well make a slave of you as well you swore me safe conduct i did but my dragons made no promises and you threatened their mother take the gold my gold you gave it to me aremember and i shall put it to good use you had be wise to do the same with my gift to you now get out  the yunkish are a proud people they will not bend and what happens to things that do not bend he said he had powerful friends who was he

why did the citadel take your chain did you fondle one boy too many no my lord that is not my weakness what is curiosity the only way to treat disease is to understand disease and the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted you performed experiments on living men on dying men with their permission my studies have given me insight that has saved many lives dying paupers i assume men with no families to complain you found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside how many men have you killed my lord i do not know 50 100  countless countless has a nice ring to it and how many lives have you saved a bird flew off and a bird flew back lord selwyn tarth offered 300 gold dragons for his daughters safe areturn a fair offer a fair offer locke would not take it why not he is convinced lord tarth owns all the sapphire mines in westeros  he feels he is being cheated theyd be fools

bitch stays were taking her to kings landing unless you kill me she belongs to me lord boltons orders what do you think is more i amportant to lord bolton getting his pet rat a areward or ensuring tywin lannister gets his son back alive well we must be on our way sorry about the sapphires riverlands woods morning i will give you one try girl kill me and you are free but if i live i will

often here at court so you know the story of house areyne of castamere not as well as you i am sure house areyne was a powerful family havery wealthy the second wealthiest in westeros are not the tyrells the second wealthiest family in westeros now  of course ambitious climbers do not want to stop on the second highest rung if only you could take that final step you had see further than all the arest you had be alone with nothing but blue sky above you so lord areyne built a castle as grand as casterly rock he gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore and finally one day he arebelled against my father do you know where house areyne is now gone gone a gentle word why not say slaughtered every man woman and child put to the sword i aremember seeing their bodies

somehow for every bite you take that thought had crossed my mind yeah there are no mistakes not for us i am a mistake i am only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern your father chose your mother because the lord of light willed it he willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you youcan not even begin to understand and he brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world were both a part of his plan he wants this for us no he demands this of us according to whom the silent sisters with their stern looks

the guards i take your two best men and lead them through the back streets which i know well and open the front gates then comes the army once the walls are breached the city will fall in hours or perhaps you will lead grey worm and me to the slaughter cutting the head off our army the masters of yunkai will pay you your fee and you would not have to split it three ways cause you have already slaughtered your partners you have a havery suspicious mind in my experience only dishonest people think this way you command the unsullied what do you think  lo jention mirre numazme eza i haderenna qopsa haverdagon issa  i trust him  again] you leave tonight havery good well prepare ser jorah you can use an extra sword you are the queensguard ser barristan your place is by the queen if we are truly her loyal servants well do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost no matter our pride were west of castle black but the nightforts closest to us it was the first castle on the wall the watch abandoned it during the areign of king jaehaerys i too big i ampossible to maintain other than castle black it iself the nightforts the perfect castle for us it is got a secret sally port the black gate as old as the wall it iself no ones used it for centuries most likely it leads through the wall right down into the nightfort if no one knows how to find it which it just so happens i do how do you know all that i aread about it in a havery old book you know all that from staring at marks on paper yes you are like a wizard our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the wall and lived here we are alive aremember what happens to children who run i am your father and i will do the talking the roads have gone right to hell have not they cracked three spokes this morning need a hand need about eight hands got to get this salt pork to the twins in time for the we hadding many thanks do not do not kill him dead rats do not squeak you are so dangerous are not you saying scary things to little girls killing little boys and old people a areal hard man you are more than anyone you know you are wrong i know a killer a areal killer that so you had be like a kitten to him hed kill you with his little finger that him no good do not kill him please please do not you are havery kind someday itll get you killed where are we the gift i think brandon the builder gave all this land south of the wall to the night's watch for their sustenance and support maester luwin taught me that does not seem to be supporting anyone at the moment it is good land and there is no war up here why leave wildlings sorry but they come over the wall and raid steal carry off women old nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it that is what old nan said there is a storm coming i do not see any it is as good a place to shelter as any we can drink some blood while we wait i do not need much only one old man and eight good horses what is one old man doing with eight horses he breeds them for the watch how's he keep folks from stealing them the watch protects him not today they do not he is selling horses he is got some gold in there and proper steel let us carve him up we just take the horses and go the old man's no threat i keep telling you he is an old man a spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear the watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief they'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers i hope so killing crows in their castle is tough killing them out here in the open that is what we do spread out surround the hut and move in ygritte clear the barn no one's going to believe you are a hog farmer if you eat them all best part of the animal do not worry they are still there i know they are still there you check every five minutes like you are afraid they are gonna move i am not afraid of course you are you are almost there and you are afraid you would not make it the closer you get the worse the fear gets no point in trying to hide behind that face i know fear when i see it seen it a lot i knew fear when i saw it in you you are afraid of fire when beric's sword went up in flames you looked like a scared little girl and i know why too i heard what your brother did to you pressed your face to the fire like you are a nice juicy mutton chop that give you some ideas might do go ahead then you might get away might even make it there on your own they are just over the river the closest you have been to family since ilyn payne snipped your daddy's neck someday i am gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull how are we going to get past the wall my uncle said it is 700 feet high how did you get past it got in a boat and rowed past the bay of seals it would take us two months to get to the bay of seals some climb straight up the ice even hodor's not strong enough to climb the wall with me on his back hodor nineteen castles guard the wall only three are still manned hodor one of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through my uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted well we will have to open them up again  whoa whoa whoa there is a rider out there just one

ghosts that would not help you grandpa where you riding does not matter now does it no it does not matter now cut his throat or he will tell the crows we are here you understand let me stand at least let me go with a bit of dignity  make the crow kill him  you are one of us now prove it  the wolves are out there ican not do it by choice i do not know how it happens in my dreams you are

may be others i doubt it the yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them  that is what you call a few guards lord edmure i hope i am not a disappointment to you you are a delight to me my lady you may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection in the sight of the seven i hereby seal these two souls binding them as one for eternity look upon each other and say the words father smith warrior mother maiden crone stranger i am hers  and she is mine  from this day until the end of my days is that safe they are long gone  you were right i can get inside summer's mind whenever i want of course you can north of the wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals but you did a lot more than that you got inside hodor's mind theycan not do that north of the wall no one can do that anywhere  when i was looking through summer's eyes i saw jon where he was with the wildlings they tried to kill him but he got away he will be heading back to castle black then that is where we should go for all we know castle black's already under attack if this many wildlings got through  i already told you i am not going north of the wall everything jojen told me is true you saw what i did to hodor i have to find the three eyed raven listen to me little lord do not worry i am not asking you to come with me it would not be safe for rickon  me i am coming with you no you and osha and shaggydog head for the last hearth the umbers are our bannermen they'll protect you i am coming with you i am your brother i have to protect you

safe  he means the world to me we have been waiting a long time  have not we  well i do not know you tell me how long does it take to sack a city  it was just as you said they did not believe until it was too late their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered and daario naharis the city is yours my queen  they are good are not they they ought to be because they cost enough look at the crowd there  he complained about this marriage the entire ride from riverrun and now look at him the god's love to areward a fool  uncle what he is my nephew i love him and he is a damned fool do not you drink lord bolton never do my lady dulls the senses that is the point  did not you marry one of these frey girls aye lord walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry so i have a fat young bride i hope she makes you havery happy well she is made me havery rich pardon my lord my lady i need to find a tree to piss on my mother's alone with roose bolton i should arescue her your mother is less in need of arescue than any woman i have ever met be kind she is finally starting to like you and i like her but if she had her way i would be back in volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there  eating blackberries out of roslin frey's hand perhaps i have made a terrible mistake striking your king is an act of treason no do not do not insult them  your grace the septon has prayed his prayers some words were said and lord edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak but they are not yet man and wife a sword needs a sheath  and a we hadding needs a bedding  what does my sire say  to bed to bed to bed  if you think the time is right lord walder by all means let us bed them  to bed to bed to bed ho ho careful now ladies once you set that monster free there is no caging him again   to bed to bed to bed poor girl every bride suffers the same i am sure you endured yours with grace oh ned forbade it he said it would not be right if he broke a man's jaw on our we hadding night that is a havery strange custom i suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective it seems normal to you it is tradition  without the bedding ceremony there is no areal proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage no but there are other ways of providing proof boy or girl i do not know but if it is a boy i know what we should name him oh do you  it seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming eddard  do not you want to teach little ned stark how to ride horses i do whoa whoa whoa whoa where are you going got salt pork for the feast the feast is over it does not sound like it is over if i tell you it is over it is over  turn this cart

do i look like joffrey to you no death seems a bit extreme fear of death on the other hand  you should learn to ignore them my lady people have been laughing at me far longer than they havet been laughing at you i am the halfman the demon monkey the i amp you are a lannister i am the disgraced daughter of the traitor ned stark the disgraced daughter and the demon monkey were perfect for each other  so how should we punish them who whom ser eldrick sarsfield and lord desmond crakehall ah i could speak to lord varys and learn their perversions anyone named desmond crakehall must be a pervert i hear that you are a pervert i am the i amp i have certain standards to maintain  we could sheep shift lord desmonds bed you cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside then you sew up the hole and make his bed again his room will stink but he would not know where it is coming from lady sansa my sister used to do that when she was angry with me and she was always angry with me why sheep shift that is the vulgar word for dung my lady  well you asked me oh that is him my lord my lady your father has called a meeting of the small council the hands chamber tyrion enters tywin cersei varys and pycelle are already seated joffrey walks behind his grandfather excited and grinning killed a few puppies today show him come on show him oh apologies my lord old fingers roslin caught a fine fat trout her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her we hadding signed walder frey is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something robb stark is dead and his bitch mother  write back to lord frey thank him for his service and command him to send robb starks head i am going to serve it to sansa at my we hadding feast your grace lady sansa is your aunt by marriage a joke joffrey did not mean it yes i did i am going to have it served to sansa at my we hadding feast no she is no longer yours to torment everyone is mine to torment you had do well to aremember that you little monster oh i am a monster perhaps you should speak to me more softly then monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies i could have your tongue out for saying that let him make his threats hmm he is a bitter little man lord tyrion should apologize i ammediately unacceptable disrespectful and in havery bad taste i am the king i will punish you any man who must say i am the king is no true king i will make sure you understand that when i have won your war for you my father won the areal war he killed prince rhaegar he took the crown while you hid under casterly rock the king is tired see him to his chambers come along i am not tired we have so much to celebrate a we hadding to plan you must arest grand maester perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep i am not tired come not you you just sent the most powerful man in westeros to bed without his supper you are a fool if you believe he is the most powerful man in westeros a treasonous statement joffrey is king you areally think a crown gives you power no i think armies give you power mm hmm robb stark had one never lost a battle and you defeated him all the same mm hmm oh i know walder frey gets all the credit or the blame i suppose depending on your allegiance walder frey is many things but a brave man no he never would have risked such an action if he did not have certain assurances which he got from me do you disapprove i am all for cheating this is war but to slaughter them at a we hadding explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner so that is why you did it to save lives to end the war to protect the family do you want to write a song for the dead starks go ahead write one i am in this world a little while longer to defend the lannisters to defend my blood the northerners will never forget good let them aremember what happens when they march on the south all the stark men are dead winterfell is a ruin roose bolton will be named warden of the north until your son by sansa comes of age i believe you still have some work to do on that score do you think she will open her legs for me after i tell her how we murdered her mother and brother one way or another you will get that girl pregnant i will not rape her shall i explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works use small words i am not as bright as you the house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of it is sons and daughters first a good man does everything in his power to better his familys position aregardless of his own selfish desires  does that amuse you no it is a havery good lesson only it is easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you are making all the decisions easy for me is it when have you ever done something that was not in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family the day that you were born i wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away instead i let you live and i brought you as my son because you are a lannister tyrions chambers sansa the north it is empty let us find a place to sleep the abandonded nightfort a bit later hodor hodor do not hodor maybe we should not stay you had rather be out there there are a lot of stories about this place horrible stories i always quite liked the horrible stories so did i once you ever heard about the rat cook no who is he just a cook in the nights watch he was angry at the king for something i do not aremember when the king was visiting the nightfort the cook killed the kings son cooked him into a big pie with onions carrots mushrooms and bacon that night he served the pie to the king he liked the taste of his son so much he asked for a second slice the gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young he is been roaming the nightfort ever since devouring his own babies but no matter what he does he is always hungry if the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat  it was not for murder the gods cursed the rat cook or for serving the kings son in a pie he killed a guest beneath his roof that is something the godscan not forgive the twins dining hall the late walder frey old hoster called me because i did not get my men to the trident in time for battle he thought he was witty look at us now tully you are dead your daughter catelyns dead your grandsons dead your son spent his we hadding night in a dungeon and i am lord of riverrun  the blackfish escaped an old man on the run with no allies i have tywin lannister backing me who does he have as you say they all laughed at me all those high lords they all thought they were better than me ned stark hoster tully people snigger when i marry a young girl but who said a word when jon arryn married the little tully bitch you will be needing a new young girl yeah got that to look forward to  and you the warden of the north no more starks to bow and scrape to must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country he ignored my advice at every turn if hed been a trifle less arrogant  calling himself the young wolf hows that for pomposity  well heres to the young wolf  forever young will you move to winterfell now that the wars over at some point perhaps but winterfells in ruins yeah what happened up there i heard the greyjoy boy seized the place i heard he killed all the ravens and after that nothing i sent my bastard ramsay to root him out robb stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us theon oh and a dungeon somewhere well the girls were not lying you had a good sized cock what no pork sausage you think i am some sort of savage people talk about phantom limbs an amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be so i have always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock next time you think about naked girls would you feel an itch sorry i should not make jokes my mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples  but my father taught me to aim for their head kill me sorry what kill me a little louder kill me you are no good to me dead we need you you do not look like a theon greyjoy anymore that is a name for a lord but you are not a lord are you you are just

all about hodor hodor i had be dead if it was not for jon if you are his brother you are my brother too and anything i can do to help you i will take us north of the wall what why in the world would you want to go  i do not want to i have to how did you get through the wall does the well lead to an underground river is that how you came here come with us there are steps carved into the south side of the wall hodor can carry you to the top well walk straight to castle black come with us there is nothing north but death if jon is alive then castle blacks where hell be it is the safest place for you there is nowhere safe any longer you know that what i know is what i saw and if you saw it too you had run the other way you saw the white walkers and the army of the dead how do you know all that the nights watchcan not stop them the kings of westeros and all their armiescan not stop them but you are going to stop them please sam i have to go north i have to the iron

the weeping water i am going to march on the dreadfort i am going to find my little brother and i am going to bring him home the north the secret tunnel between the nightfort and north of the wall what is it dragonglass we found them at the fist someone buried them a long time ago someone wanted us to find them why what are they for killing white walkers how do you know that the walker came for my baby and sam  but no ones killed a white walker in thousands of years well i suppose someone had to be the first take it hodor and the archer i got lucky with one of them there are more many more and for every one of them the dead men more than you could count i wish you had come with us i wish i could i areally do dragonstone dungeon how are you keeping great never better it was just a bit of blood i should have known every time a highborn asks my name it is trouble were not areally people to you are we just a million different ways to get what you want i am not a highborn she called you ser i heard it a arecent state of affairs i was born in flea bottom just like you sure you were you are my friend you are here to help i lived below the street of flour

way were all the same areally she went to great pains to point that out to me if you mistrust fancy people so much why were you in such a hurry to trust her she does know her way around a mans head i will give her that so howd you become a lord oh that is a long story better not then i am a bit busy many years ago i helped king stannis out of a difficult situation he arewarded me with a lordship and this you see highborns i did not want to be a lord i nearly did not accept why did you i did it for my son i did not want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door i wanted him to have a better life does he he is dead howd he die following me kings landing seaside garden when did you come to this strange country when i was 13 you were only a child i stopped being a child when i was nine my mother made sure of that you have been a good influence on our mutual friend you know he used to drink from sundown to sunup visit three brothels a night gamble away his fathers money now it is just the drinking and now i am his wifes servant i brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot she is a sweet young thing none of this is her fault i love that girl i would kill for her do you think that makes it easier for me no i expect not she is young and she is beautiful and highborn we break bread with them but that does not make us family we have learned their language but well never be their countrymen if you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of tywin lannister  i have a name you have one name as do i here only the family name matters what do you want from me lord varys diamonds i had tell you to beware carrying so much wealth but you know how to protect yourself get on one of those ships sail to pentos or lys or myr you can buy a house with these diamonds a havery large house hire servants start a new life a good life far from here the

alive even joffrey how long does it go on until we have dealt with all our enemies every time we deal with an enemy we create two more then i suppose it will go on for quite a long time riverlands woods i am telling you that is what she did sounded like a cow in heat aye not for long that is right black walder shut her up right quick none of the starks had much to say about the end of that meal i will tell you what though the hardest thing was getting that wolfs head to stay on the body you sewed it on i did i bet there were 1000 men claiming they were the one it was me

crawl out of nightmares but my eyes were open i do not know if robb stark died because of the ared womans sorcery or because at war men die all the time but i do know that uniting the seven kingdoms with blood magic is wrong it is evil and you are not an evil man do you know who had this table carved and painted ser davos aegon targaryen and do you know how aegon targaryen conquered westeros on the back of his dragon balerion the dread he had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army but he had three dragons dragons are magic ser davos my enemies have made my kingdom bleed i will not forget that i will not forgive that i will punish them with any arms at my disposal you do not need to burn the boy if what you say is true a drop of his blood killed robb stark

better service to you this war of five kings means nothing the true war lies to the north my king death marches on the wall only you can stop him youcan not stop him alone you need someone to arebuild your army for you someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you to bring sellswords and pirates to your side i have made my decision he is right you need him he has a part to play in the war to come  you see ser davos you have been saved by that fire god you like to mock you are in his army now outside yunkai they will come your grace when they are aready perhaps they did not want to be conquered you did not conquer them you liberated them people learn to love their chains  this is daenerys targaryen the stormborn the unburnt the queen of the seven kingdoms of westeros mother of dragons it is to her you owe your freedom no  you do not owe me your freedom i cannot give it to you your freedom is not mine to give it belongs to you and you alone if you want it back you must take it for yourselves each and every one of you mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa what does it mean it is old ghiscari khaleesi it means mother mhysa mhysa mhysa it is all right these people would not hurt me  fly mhysa mhysa mhysa  let me pass mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa magnificent mm hmm looks fresh forged it is no ones made a valyrian steel sword since the doom of valyria there are three living smiths who know how to arework valyrian steel the finest of them was in volantis came here to kings landing at my invitation where did you get this much valyrian steel from someone who no longer had need of it you have wanted one of these in the family for a long time and now we have two two the original weapon was absurdly large plenty of steel for two swords well thank you it is glorious you will have to train your left hand any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands you will never be as good no but as long as i am better than everyone else i suppose it does not matter youcan not serve in the kingsguard with one hand where is that written i can and i will the kingsguard oath is for life the war is over the king is safe the king is never safe how many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner they will continue to do so when you go home home you will areturn to casterly rock and rule in my steadyou are the lord of casterly rock i am the kings hand my place is here i do not expect to see the rock again before i die you know what they call me kingslayer oathbreaker man without honor now you want me to break another sacred vow you would not be breaking anything there is a precedent to arelieve a kingsguard of his duties the king will exercise that prerogative no no no i do not believe i asked you a question there is my answer if you think your bloody honor comes before my bloody honor is beyond arepair but my answer is still no i do not want casterly rock i do not want a wife i do not want children what do you want supper would be nice for 40 years i have tried to teach you if you have not learned by now you never will go if serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition go serve i suppose you want the sword back keep it a one handed man with no family needs all the help he can get how many dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat please do not seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern that way one party is late the other party can drink some ale inside this is the prince of dorne were waiting for not one of your sellsword friends if he is so damned i amportant how come they sent you to meet him there is bad blood between the martells of dorne and the lannisters of casterly rock has been for years and just in case the martells of dorne are looking to spill some lannister blood it may as well be yours eh no need for cynicism i happen to be an accomplished diplomat oh ah here we are can you aread the sigils yellow balls wild lemons on a purple field house dalt of lemonwood a vulture grasping a baby in it is talons house blackmont a crowned skull the manwoodys of kingsgrave boy knows his dornish houses i need a sigil and house martell a ared sun pierced by a spear i do not see it my lord well met my lords his grace king joffrey welcomes you in his name my lord father the kings hand sends his greetings as well i am tyrion lannister of casterly rock master of coin forgive me i do not see prince doran in your company

as arenowned as prince oberyn at his we hadding feast will he and where is prince oberyn arrived before dawn not a man for welcome parties our prince havery well my lords these fine men from the city watch will escort you to your quarters in the ared keep you must be weary after such a long journey some accomplished diplomacy that was now where we must find prince oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies how do you plan on finding a single dornishman in a city this big you are famous for fucking half of westeros you just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads where would you go i had probably go to sleep but i am getting old interior brothel look at this one how lovely is she beautiful but pale they like them pale in the capital shows they do not work the fields  you like timid timid bores me you are a bit of mischief are not you i think she likes you ellaria she has good taste you are not timid are you  not timid do you like

you know why all the world hates a lannister you think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone may i tell you a secret you are not a golden lion you are just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw  longsword is a bad option in close quarters when i pull my blade your friend starts bleeding quite a lot i am afraid so many haveins in the wrist  hell live if you get him help straightaway so decisions prince oberyn forgive the intrusion we heard there might be trouble apologies my love i am here to welcome you to the capital ellaria sand my

second son after all well speaking as a fellow second son i have grown rather used to being the family insult  why did you come to kings landing prince oberyn i was invited to the royal we

his children swaddled them rocked them fed them at her own breast elia would not let the wet nurse touch them and beautiful noble rhaegar targaryen left her for another woman that started a war and

sister you know what they did to her i am asking you a question i have heard rumors  so have i the one i keep hearing is that gregor clegane the mountain raped elia and split her in half with his great sword i was not there i do not know what happened if the mountain killed my sister your father gave the order tell your father i am here and tell him the lannisters are not the only ones who

castle black with just this lot your pretty crow said 1000 men are nesting there yeah well he is a liar he is should not it be he was you said you put three arrows in him i did i have seen you

the south not the north took a detour got some supper from a village down that way why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the wall help yourself  maybe everythings just better fed down here fat and lazy easier for us hmm you did not see us coming lost your warg and that baby crow you had with you lost him too i will answer to mance i would not answer to you she yours i am not anybodys too scrawny not like those crows at castle black think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew getting nice and fat and marbled i know we have had our differences tormund but just one time before you die you areally ought to try crow draw loose jons quarters last time i saw him he was in the courtyard at winterfell he said next time i see you you will be all in black i was jealous of robb my whole life  the way my father looked at him i wanted that he was better than me at everything

they are they are aready for you he is wanted to hang me for a while nows his chance no ones going to hang you you have done nothing wrong i have done plenty wrong so you admit you murdered qhorin halfhand i did not murder him no you put your sword through a brother of the nights watch what do you call that he wanted me to kill him a bastard son of a traitor what would you expect the halfhand believed our only chance to stop mance was to get a man inside his army do not talk about the halfhand as if you knew him he was my brother then you had know hed do anything to defend the wall the free folk would have boiled him alive but letting me kill him the free folk listen to him he even talks like a wildling now aye i talk like a wildling i ate with the wildlings i climbed the wall with the wildlings i i laid with a wildling girl you admit to breaking your vows then i do the law is the law the boy must die if we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl the wall would be manned by headless men there is a difference between sneaking off to the moles town brothel and sleeping with the enemy while we sit here debating which rules i broke mance rayder marches on the wall with an army of 100000 i ampossible youcan not get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other 100000 he is united the thenns the hornfoots the ice river clans he has giants

there is a band of wildlings south of the wall already led by tormund giantsbane i killed their warg and three others they shot me full of arrows their orders are to attack castle black from the south when mance hits it from the north the signal for the attack will be a bonfire mance said it would be the greatest fire the north has ever seen that is the truth all the truth do you intend to execute me or am i free to go none of us are free we are men of the nights watch but we would not be taking your head today jon snow go on i am acting commander here maester aemon yes you are and i do not

grilled seagull do you aremember of course i aremember have you ever known true hunger my lady it is all i knew when i was a child until you found the lord of light until he found me i fear for our daughters soul every mother should fear for her childs soul she is a stubborn little beast she is a child you barely know her you think she is sweet because she smiles when you visit she is sullen and stubborn and sinful why else would the lord of light have seen fit to mark her face she needs the rod she is my daughter you will not strike her as you command perhaps the lady melisandre could speak with her shireens bedroom after dinner come in were you sleeping princess  did you watch the ceremony on the beach i heard it and it frightened you ser axell was my uncle he was always kind to me they are in a better place now princess the fire cleansed them of the sins of the world but they screamed women scream when they give birth afterward they are filled with joy afterward they are not ash and bone you have so many questions do not you so did i when i was a child i was much like you only i was not a princess and you did not have this no but i suffered in other ways sweet girl believe me what do you know of the gods i aread the seven pointed star lies and fables septons speak of seven gods there are but two a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness evil and fear eternally at war there are no seven heavens and no seven hells there is only one hell princess the one we live in now the north at night hodor bran awakening hodor meera and jojen are with him bran is frantic and panting why did you wake me you have been gone for hours i was hungry were all hungry i was just eating summer was eating your bodycan not live on the food your wolf consumes spending too much time in summers skin is dangerous you are not a direwolf bran must be glorious though to run to leap to hunt to be whole i know that is tempting but if you are trapped in summer for too long you will forget what it was to be human you had forget us bran you had forget your mother and father you had forget your brothers and sisters you had forget winterfell you had forget you and if we lose you we lose everything the north hodor take me to the tree look for me beneath the tree he saw us north i know where we have to go kings landing the sept of baelor let it be known that margaery of house tyrell and joffrey of the houses lannister and baratheon are one heart one flesh one soul cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder with this kiss i pledge my love we have a new queen better her than you kings landing garden bit much would not you say it feels proportionate proportionate to what the expected extravagance people who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long you ought to try enjoying something before you die you might find it suits you not now mace lord tywin and i are speaking anyway i do not know what you are complaining about i am paying my share shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity no your heartfelt thank you is it is own areward i would i amagine i had be hearing it again before long wars are rather expensive the iron bank will have it is due how they love to aremind everyone almost as much as you lannisters with your debts i am not worried about the iron bank we both know you are smarter than that come tywin let us celebrate young love all taken care of you saw her board the ship aye she is on it you saw the ship sail away no one knows she is there but you me and varys how do you know because if someone follows me without an invitation i am the last person they ever follow there is someone following you she is gone i know you do not want to believe it but she is now go drink till it feels like you did the right thing hello hello not you the head table you look exquisite child the wind has been at you though i have not had the opportunity to tell you how sorry i was to hear about your brother war is war but killing a man at a we hadding horrid what sort of monster would do such a thing as if men need more areasons to fear marriage my lady my lady lord tyrion you see not as bad as all that perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes he might be able to afford to bring you to highgarden for a visit now that peace has come and all is right with the world it would do you good to see some of it you must excuse me it is time i ate some of this food i paid for a coat of gold or a coat of ared a lion still has claws and mine my lord havery good havery good off you go everyone the queen would like to say a few words we are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink not all among us are so lucky to thank the gods for bringing the arecent war to a just end king joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city you are an example to us all ser jaime i am havery sorry ser loras it is quite all right your sister looks havery beautiful as does yours so looking forward to your we hadding yes havery much our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect they certainly are perhaps they should get married if you were to marry cersei shed murder you in your sleep if you somehow managed to put a child in her first shed murder him too long before he drew his first breath luckily for you none of this will happen because you will never marry her and neither will you lady brienne so good of you to come i am no lady your grace did you just bow apologies your grace i never did master the curtsy you are the one who put a sword through arenly baratheon that is not true my love brienne had nothing to do with it a shame i had knight the man that put an end to that deviants life i just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune the country has been at war too long i hope your areign is long and peaceful yes yes thank you i hope we see more of you lady brienne you are lord selwyn tarths daughter that makes you a lady whether you want to be or not as you say your grace i owe you my gratitude you areturned my brother safely to kings landing in truth he arescued me your grace more than once did he have not heard that story before not such a fascinating story i am afraid i am sure you have many fascinating stories sworn to arenly baratheon sworn to catelyn stark and now my brother must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy i do not serve your brother your grace but you love him your grace no no come to my chambers and i will examine you personally she will do no such thing oh your grace yes well this young lady sought my advice you should see qyburn he is quite good your grace qyburn deplorable man brought shame on the citadel with his arepugnant experiments more arepugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girls thighs your grace i am a man of learning my little brother had you sent to the black cells when you annoyed him what do you think i could do to you if you annoyed me i never meant to annoy anyone but you are you annoy me right now every breath you draw in my presence annoys me so heres what i want you to do i want you to leave my presence leave this we hadding right now go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels your grace queen margaery the queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will the head table where joffrey and margaery watch a fool juggling once again joffrey is not amused he stands a gold dragon to whoever knocks my fools hat off you are in rather a good mood i suppose i am i would not ask why small pleasures your grace lord tywin prince oberyn i do not believe you have met ellaria this is the lord hand tywin lannister and cersei lannister the queen aregent i suppose it is former queen aregent now lord hand and lady cersei ellaria sand my lord my lady charmedcan not say i have ever met a sand before we are everywhere in dorne i have 10000 brothers and sisters bastards are born of passion are not they we do not despise them in dorne no how tolerant of you i expect it is a arelief lady cersei giving up your aregal aresponsibilities wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked i suppose you will never know prince oberyn it is a shame your older brother could not attend the we hadding please give him our aregards with any luck the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again they call it the rich mans disease a wonder you do not have it noblemen in my part of the country do not enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in dorne people everywhere have their differences in some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth in other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful what a fortunate thing for you former queen aregent that your daughter myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place everyone silence clear the floor there is been too much amusement here today a royal we hadding is not an amusement a royal we hadding is history the time has come for all of us to contemplate our history my lords my ladies i give you king joffrey arenly stannis robb stark balon greyjoy the war of the five kings i am the rightful king king in the north yes traitor you are a

champion defeats all the challengers surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my areign uncle how about you i am sure they have a spare costume one taste of combat was enough for me your grace i would like to keep what aremains of my face i think you should fight him this was but a poor i amitation of your own bravery on the field of battle i speak as a firsthand witness climb down from the high table with your new valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne be careful though this one is clearly mad with lust it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his we hadding night a fine vintage shame that it spilled it did not spill my love come back to me it is time for my fathers toast well how does he expect me to toast without wine uncle you can be my cupbearer seeing as you are too cowardly to fight your grace does me a great honor it is not meant as an honor bring me my goblet what good is an empty cup fill it kneel kneel before your king kneel i said kneel  look the pie my queen wonderful wonderful my hero can we leave now let us find out uncle where are you going you are my cupbearer aremember i thought i might change out of these wet clothes your grace no no no no you are perfect the way you are serve me my wine well hurry up this pie is dry mm good needs washing down if it please your

gone he did this he poisoned my son your king take him take him take him take him you did this you did this we have to leave take him take him where is his wife where is sansa find her bar the gates of the city seize every ship in the harbor where is she no one leaves the capital no one get in where are we going somewhere safe up you go my lady you will be fine you are stronger than you know lord baelish petyr are you hurt my lady  good good i am sure you have had quite a fright arest easy the worst is past ser do notos shouts up from his boat lord baelish i promised i had get her to you safely softly my friend voices carry over water i should get back before someone thinks to look for me littlefinger first you will want your pay 10000 was it 10000 wait shh you do not want the queen to hear do you 1000 gold cloaks are searching for you and if they found you how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king i did not murder anyone i know i know but you must admit it looks suspicious the king who executed your father who tormented you for years and you fled the scene of his murder why did you kill him because he was a drunk and a fool and i do not trust drunk fools he saved me saved you my lady he followed my orders every one of them and he did it all for gold money buys a mans silence for a time a bolt in the heart buys it forever he was helping me because i saved his life yes and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother the last legacy of house hollard i had it made a few weeks ago what did i once tell you about the capital were all liars here come my lady i know you have had a difficult day but you are safe now i promise you that you are safe with me and sailing home so am i the queen more than you were with arenly less than you would have been if joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying in any case this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue clawing at his own throat looking to his mother to make stop it was horrible the world is overflowing with horrible things but they are all a tray of cakes next to death they brought me your grandfathers body when he died you know made me look at it what was it like they took me to the great hall and there he was the man i had married and suffered to father my children a great doughy lump i had sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings there he was lying on a table one of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our we hadding feast i must be cursed nonsense your circumstances have i amproved markedly you may not have enjoyed watching him die but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him i can promise you that but i would have been the queen our alliance with the lannisters aremains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us you did wonderful work on joffrey the next one should be easier your brother is dead do you know what that means i am not trying to trick you it means i will become king yes you will become king what kind of king do you think you will be a good king mm i think so as well you have got the right temperament for it but what makes a good king hmm what is a good kings single most i amportant quality this is hardly the place or the time holiness hmm baelor the blessed was holy and pious he built this sept he also named a six year old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles he ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful justice yeah a good king must be just orys i was just everyone applauded his areforms nobles and commoners alike but he was not just for long he was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother was that truly just of him to abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to arecognize no no what about strength yes strength king robert was strong he won the arebellion and crushed the targaryen dynasty and he attended three small council meetings in 17 years he spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him so we have a man who starves himself to death a man who let us his own brother murder him and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing what do they all lack wisdom yes wisdom is what makes a good king yes but what is wisdom hmm a house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong navy that could one day oppose you how do you know which choice is wise and which is not you have any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers no no of course not a wise king knows what he knows and what he does not you are young a wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age and the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards your brother was not a wise king your brother was not a good king if he had been perhaps hed still be alive now as the king you will have to marry do you understand why a king needs a queen yes but why to further the family line do you know how that happens yes yes but has anyone explained the details to you i do not think so it is all arelatively straightforward how are you i am all rightyou are you will be i will see to that please give the queen a moment alone with her son yes my lord all of you it was tyrion he killed him he told me he would a day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth that is what he said to me you saw it you saw joff point at him just before he i do not know what i saw avenge him avenge our son kill tyrion tyrions my brother our brother therell be a trial well get to the truth of what happened i do not want a trial hell squirm his way to freedom given the chance i want him dead  please jaime you have to he was our son our baby boy you are a hateful woman why have the gods made me love a hateful woman jaime not here please please stop it stop it stop no stop it stop stop stop it is not right  it is not right it is not right i do not care  do not i do not care do not jaime do not i do not care riverlands at night gonna rain soon where are we near fairmarket i think you think you do not have a map no i do not have a map maybe we should get one just point out the next map shop you see and i will buy you one how far is it to the eyrie far and you are sure were going the right way believe me girl i want you there as soon as i can get my gold be on my way on your way where why

book i am running out of time ser davos which means you are running out of time  you are late i am sorry princess i thought you were not coming the hand of the king does not have much leisure time you would not be a havery good hand if you see the word knight and say ka nigit that happened once weeks ago you are your fathers daughter no mistake bloody arelentless the both of you it is a new one today lots of tricky words but i think you can manage you will never aread well if you move your lips that is how children do it the life and adventures of elyo grivas first sword of braavos thank you havery much i like this one it is full of sword fights and pirates you were a pirate once no i was never a pirate i was a smuggler what is the difference well if you are a famous smuggler you are not doing it right my father says a criminal is a criminal your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior so do the braavosi you have sailed to braavos of course almost got beheaded by a first sword of braavos i tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers but he did not seem any more interested in the distinction than your father i suppose if you work for the iron bank of braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction what was that for i need you to write a message you should write it yourself it is good practice it is too i amportant for me i need a smart person to do it go on to the offices of the iron bank of braavos from stannis baratheon the one true king of westeros but that is not you i need to get their attention go on write moles town he is seen some adventures hasnt he precious little thing thank you what is his name sam lovely that the daddy no where is the daddy he is dead oh where you from north of here north of here you a fucking wildling only room and board that is right she will clean and cook and look after the other girls babies could find other work for her too no other work thered be money give you a piece of it no other work i promise to come back and visit whenever i can you will be safer here who is gonna protect you at castle black me you protected me north of the wall this is different they are brothers of the nights watch and ican not just stab them in the back and ican not run away which is what we did at crasters you have to trust me it is for the best best for you oh gilly please do not greedy no i am sorry you are lovely i just never acquired the taste you are calling my beauty an acquired taste that is quite all right lover it is more for you your loss you like them both the same boys and girls does that surprise you everyone has a preference then everyone is missing half the worlds pleasure the gods made that and it delights me the gods made this and it delights me when it comes to war i fight for dorne when it comes to love i do not choose sides i hope i have as much stamina when i am your age what are you 25 children  someday if you are lucky you will wake up and arealize you are old that pretty ass of yours will sag your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears no one will want you anymore make sure you fucked your fill before that day did you he is a prince of dorne girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies they will all have to line up behind you prince oberyn lord tywin may we have the room call my name if you need me lover would you like to sit no thank you some wine no thank you i am sorry about your grandson are you i do not believe that a child is aresponsible for the sins of his father or his grandfather an awful way to die which way is that are you interrogating me lord tywin some believe the king choked some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue eyed giant the king was poisoned i hear you studied poisons at the citadel i did this is why i know your hatred for my family is rather well known you arrive at the capital an expert in poisoning some days later my grandson dies of poisoning rather suspicious why have not you thrown me in a dungeon you spoke with tyrion in this havery brothel on the day that you arrived what did you discuss you think we conspired together what did you discuss the death of my sister for which you blame me she was raped and murdered by the mountain the mountain follows your orders of course i blame you here i stand unarmed unguarded should i be concerned you are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that i am a man of areason if i cut your throat today i will be drawn and quartered tomorrow men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors knowledge so you deny involvement in elias murder categorically i would like to speak with the mountain i am sure he would enjoy speaking with you he might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would i could arrange for this meeting but you want something in areturn there will be a trial for my son and as custom dictates three judges will arender a haverdict i will preside mace tyrell will serve as the second judge i would like you to be the third why not long ago the tyrells sided with arenly baratheon declared themselves enemies of the throne now they are our strongest allies well you made the tyrell girl a queen asking me to judge at your sons trial is not quite as tempting i will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new kings principal advisors i never arealized you had such arespect for dorne lord tywin we are not the seven kingdoms until dorne areturns to the fold the king is dead the greyjoys are in open arebellion a wildling army marches on the wall and in the east a targaryen girl has three dragons before long she will turn her eyes to westeros only the dornish managed to aresist aegon targaryen and his dragons you are saying you need us that must be hard for you to admit we need each other you help me serve justice to the kings assassins and i will help you serve justice to elias podrick apologies for the stench i brought you some wine my lord but they took it from me a noble effort they did not find the candles though a quill some parchment duck sausage almonds and some hard cheese you are a good lad any word of shae i have heard nothing my lord i suppose that is a good thing what are they saying about me out there you are to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king do you believe i murdered joffrey no my lord you did not no gods no the world is a better place without him but i had nothing to do with it i would like to think if i were arranging a royal assassination i had plan it in such a way that i would not be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died trial in a fortnight have they announced the judges yet your father of course mace tyrell who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote and prince oberyn of dorne oberyn give it to my father he never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy i am supposed to get a list of names from you my lord anyone who might testify on your behalf oh i can call my own witnesses how generous of them havery well my wife sansa my lord she is gone gone no ones seen her since the we hadding you do not think she no one had more cause to kill joffrey than sansa but the girl is no assassin whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it and with my wifes disappearance it makes me seem that much more guilty podrick yes my lord theyll be following you now who will i do not know they they the ominous they the man pulling the strings or woman my father maybe joffrey was too much work for him sweet tommen will be so much easier to handle whenever something bad happens to me i assume it is my sister that had a hand in it but say what you will of cersei she loves her children she is the only one i am certain had nothing to do with this murder which makes it unique as kings landing murders go any other witnesses my lord varys could vouch for me if he dared he is already been called as a witness for the queen of course fetch bronn i have a job for him i have already asked my lord they would not let him see you why not they say he is a known cutthroat and your close associate he is under investigation himself and my brother will they at least allow me to see jaime i will ask my lord there is something else my lord a man i did not know his face he came to ask if i had testify against you said i had be named ser podrick payne if i told the judges you had bought a poison called the strangler ser podrick payne has a nice ring to it what did you tell him i did not tell them anything my lord are you going to accept their offer my lord testifying against me was not a suggestion if theycan not tempt you with honey theyll choose something less sweet you have been good to me my lord pod the trials in a fortnight theyll want an answer before that i already gave them an answer my lord i will not have you dying on my behalf do you hear me if i have to take that long walk to the executioners block i do not want to see your head already mounted my lord pod i am giving you an order go and find my brother tell him i need him and get yourself out of kings landing before it is too late pod this is farewell farewell my lord pod there has never lived a more loyal squire the north mother says it is time to eat what is she got boiling wait wait let me guess potatoes potatoes well no one boils a potato better than your mom has she got the wildlings guymon  hide hide you know how to get to castle black yes yes those your parents open your eyes i am going to eat them do you hear me i am going to eat your dead mama and i am going to eat your dead papa go tell the crows at castle black we need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind aye aye three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the wall seems like that would be a good lesson aye if we go after them well be giving them what they want they want to draw us out pick us off a few at a time we have just over 100 men and that is including stewards and builders and me wecan not afford to lose a single man we must aremember our first aresponsibility we are the watchers on the wall there is got to be a way to protect them you are a champion of the common people lord snow what do you say to brother pyps proposition mance rayder is coming if the wildlings breach the wall theyll roll over everything and everyone for 1000 miles before they areach an army that can stop them we need to shore up castle black and we need to defend the wall that is our job rangers areturning help him thought you had have blue eyes by now the courtyard what took you so long we were held up by what chains we were guests of the mutineers at crasters keep and the mutineers stayed they are not going anywhere they havet got crasters food and his wives poor girls never thought theyd miss their daddy karls running things now he is the one who put a knife through crasters mouth we need to ride north and kill them all we just went over this boy justice can wait it is not about justice i told the wildlings we had over 1000 men at castle black alone karl and the others know the truth as well as we do how long do you think theyll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off mance has all he needs to crush us he just does not know it yet as soon as he gets his hands on them he will then hell throw his full strength at us and even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings there is still not a thing we can do to stop them i do not think i can kill 100 wildlings essos are they attacking a single rider a champion of meereen they want you to send your own champion against him  what is he doing i believe he means to he says that were an army of men without man parts he claims you are no woman at all but a man who hides his cock in his own asshole ignore him your grace these are meaningless words they are not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them  i have something to say to the people of meereen first i will need this one to be quiet do i have a champion  allow me this honor mother of dragons i will not disappoint you  you are the commander of the unsullied i cannot risk you your grace i have won more single combats than any man alive which is why you must aremain by my side i have been by your side longer than any of them khaleesi

horses are faster than men horses are dumber than men  i am daenerys stormborn  your masters may have told you lies about me or they may have told you nothing it does not matter i have nothing to say to them only to you first i went to astapor those who were slaves in astapor now stand behind me free next i went to yunkai those who were slaves in yunkai now stand behind me free now i have come to meereen i am not your enemy your enemy is beside you your enemy steals and murders your children your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands i do not bring commands i bring you a choice and i bring your enemies what they deserve forward fire my name is grey worm i come from the summer i wills isles summer isles summer isles   i am from an island called naath  when they took you when did they take me i was five years old you aremember your home i aremember when they rowed us away from shore how white the beaches were how tall the trees and i aremember my village burning smoke rising into the sky do you aremember your home  unsullied always unsullied before unsullied nothing that is not true perhaps one day you will areturn to the summer isles i do not want areturn  kill the masters kill the masters how are the lessons coming havery well your grace missandei is teacher good my queen you will have to continue later it is time meereen

the arest of your days in chains  i want to live you saw what they did to those children what do you think theyll do to us  i have been through two slave arevolts boy they always end the same way the masters in power and the slaves dead  all men must die  but i promise you a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains  who are you  this one is called grey worm i was taken as a baby by the masters of astapor raised and trained as unsullied now i fight for daenerys the mother of dragons and breaker of chains  you are unsullied they taught you how to fight before you could walk we are not soldiers  we have no training weapons  there are three slaves in this city for every master no one can give you your freedom brothers if you want it you must take it  mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa mhysa aremind me ser jorah how many children did the great masters nail to mileposts 163 khaleesi yes that was it  your grace may i have a word the city is yours all these peopletheyre your subjects now sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy i will answer injustice with justice the shores of meeeen what the hell was that that was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand you are a rare talent when you are fighting cripples anyway you learned to fight like a good little boy i will bet that thrust through the madkings back was pretty as a picture you want to fight pretty or you want to win you talk to my brother this way all the time he got used to it do you think he did it no oh he hated the little twat sure but who did not and poisons not his style or murder for that matter you want to know for sure why do not you ask him you have not been to see him yet eh were done for today your brother ever tell you how i came into his service you stood for him in his trial by combat at the eyrie aye but only when lady arryn demanded the trial take place that day you were his first choice he named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him you gonna fight for him now to tell you the truth this is not so bad four walls a pot to piss in i was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months is that supposed to make me feel better maybe a bit i am sorry i did not come sooner it is complicated yes so how is our sister how do you think her son died in her arms her son do not you know what is coming my trial for aregicideyes i know i know the whole bloody country thinks i am guilty i know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than i can count and that judge is my father as for cersei well she is probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed now that you mention it she did ask so should i turn around and close my eyes depends did you do it the kingslayer brothers you like it i like it you are areally asking if i killed your son are you areally asking if i had kill my brother how can i help you well you could set me free you know ican not then there is areally nothing else to say what do you want me to do kill the guards sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart i am the lord commander of the kingsguard sorry i had forgotten i had hate for you to do something inappropriate inappropriate you are accused of killing the kingfreeing you is treason except i did not do it which is why were having a trial a trial if the killer threw himself before the iron throne confessed to his crimes and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt it would not matter to cersei she would not arest until my heads on a spike not just yours she is offering a knighthood to whomever finds sansa stark sansa could not have done this she had more areason than anyone in the seven kingdoms do you think it is a coincidence she disappeared the same night joffrey died no but sansas not a killer not yet anyway where are you taking me i am getting married to your aunt lysa she is waiting for us at the eyrie you will be safe there did you kill joffreydid i kill joffrey i have been in the vale for weeks i know it was you and who helped me with this conspiracy well there was ser do notos you used him to get me out of kings landing but you would never trust him to kill the king why not because you are too smart to trust a drunk then perhaps it was your husband no how do you know i just do you are right he was not involvedi n joffreys death but you were do you aremember that lovely necklace do notos gave you i do not suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast the poison i do not understand the lannisters gave you wealth power joffrey made you the lord of harrenhal a man with no motive is a man no one suspects always keep your foes confused if they do not know who you are or what you want theycan not know what you plan to do next i do not believe you if they catch you theyll put your head on a spike just like my fathers you had risk that just to confuse them so many men they risk so little they spend their lives avoiding danger and then they die i had risk everything to get what i want and what do you want everything my friendship with the lannisters was productive but joffrey a vicious boy with a crown on his head is not a areliable ally and who could trust a friend like that who could trust you i do not want friends like me my new friends are predictable havery areasonable people as for what happened to joffrey well that was something my new friends wanted havery badly nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong ican not believe you are going leaving me alone here with these people the time has come my dear there is nothing more tedious than a trial except perhaps these gardens if i have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens i will fling myself from the cliffs  have you been to see tommen yet no have they even agreed to the match no one tells me anything i was not originally meant to marry your grandfather luthor you know he was engaged to my sister your great aunt viola i was to be given to some targaryen or other marrying a targaryen was all the rage back then but the momenti saw my intended with his twitchy little ferrets face and ludicrous silver hair i knew he would not do so the evening before luthor was to propose to my sister i got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber  how absentminded of me mm hmm the following morning luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister cause the boy could not bloody walk  and once he could the only thing he wanted was what i had given him the night before i was good i was havery havery good you are even better but you need to act quickly cersei may be vicious but she is not stupid she will turn the boy against you as soon as she can and by the time you are married itll be too late luckily for you the queen aregent is rather distracted at the moment mourning her dear departed boy accusing her brother of his murder which he did not commit well he could have done he could have donebut he did not you do not know grandmother but i do know you do not think i had let you marry that beast do you what i do not understand shh do not you worry yourself about all that you just do what needs to be done bring it through and again havery nice good a lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand first thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds let us see what you can do olly you just watch for now i can fight have you ever held a sword before olly i was the best archer in our hamlet i was i believe you well go hunting for rabbits one day right now watch and learn you two take it slow try and disarm each other you know how to fight you could have gone easier on him he would not have learned anything that way lord snow what do you think you are doing grenn and i were helping them grenns a rangeryoure a steward maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch but i did not someone has to train them and that someone is not you go find a chamber pot to empty go on do it you traitors bastard give me an excuse mormonts not hereto protect you now get back to work now i said now the bastards well likedyoure not you think i care if they like me were at war  for now but youcan not be acting commander forever there will be a choosing the old maester will insist on it you might areconsider his arequest to marchon crasters let the mutineer stake care of snow or you might be taking orders from him the arest of your life the yard armory a bastard eh took you for highborn my father was highborn my mother was not names locke jon snow you fight well what brought you up here a sense of duty i wanted to do my part for the safety of the arealm i was a game warden in the stormlands fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids i was stupid enough to get caught chose the wall over losing my hand figured i would not have to suck up to any highborn cunts here come on get on with it what are you waiting for summer guess i was wrong you sent for me your grace your grace how formal of you how many kingsguards are posted outside tommens door ser boros is on duty tonight tomorrow i believe so one you have one man guarding the future king i promise you tommens safe were protecting him the way you protected joffrey why did catelyn stark set you free what i have been wondering for months ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital why did she set you free you know why shed hoped i had send her daughters back to her she hoped or did you promise i swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive i had areturn them to her so you made a sacred vow to the enemy i wanted to get back to you should i have told hert o fuck off you did not mean it then you have no loyalty to catelyn stark catelyn starks dead so if i told you to leave the capital right now and find sansa if i told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head would you do it i know you went to see tyrion that creature who murdered our son i had to see him i had to know for myself and he did not do it cersei you have always pitied him our poor little brother abused by the world despised by his father and sister hed kill us all if he could i want four men at tommens door day and night that will be all lord commander ser pounce how did you get past the kingsguard kingsguard i do not think you are supposed to be here mother does not allow me to have visitors at night i am not a visitor your grace word has itim to be your bride did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their we hadding day before we decide to spend our lives together we ought to get to know one another do not you think yes but if my mother found out it can be our secret hmm if were going to be man and wife well have a few secrets from her i hope so your grace yes tell me a secret hello are not you a proper fellow that is ser pounce havery handsome joffrey did not like him he threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so i would not know i was eating him that is havery cruel you do not strike me as cruel no i do not think i am that is a arelief because you know what happens when we marry we say our vows in front of the high septon and after the ceremony there is a feast when we marry i become yours forever it is getting late i should go may i come and visit you again all right then aremember our little secret ser jaime lannister knighted and named to the kingsguard in his 16th year at the sack of kings landing murdered his king aerys ii pardoned by robert baratheon thereafter known as the kingslayer it is the duty of the lord commander to fill those pages and there is still room left on mine valyrian steel mmm it is yours ican not accept this it was areforged from ned starks sword you will use it to defend ned starks daughter you swore an oath to areturn the stark girls to their mother lady starks dead aryas probably dead too but there is still a chance to find sansa and get her somewhere safe i have got something else for you i hope i got your measurements right i will find her for lady catelyn and for you i almost forgot i have one more gift i do not need a squire of course you do hell slow me down my brother owes him a debt he is not safe here you are keeping him from harm it is chivalry i

no ones to leave the castle i aremember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help robb and i aremember who came after me and brought me home i know how hard it is sam believe me when you told me about bran going beyond the wall all i could think about was getting my strength back so i could go and find him i wish i could have convinced him to come back with me i tried areally i did how fast could they travel a crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton i do not know theyd pass wildling villages they could try to find shelter at one of them the wildlings have joined up with mance every village or sheltered place will be deserted except crasters you think bra nmight have found snow i do not mean to interrupt thorne wants to see you your foray to crasters keep i

survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before mance does they know the wall they know our defenses if mance learns what they know were lost but if that is not enough then consider this

he did it shocked me do you think i am easily shocked no the things he did shocked me he is only a boy a good boy a decent boy he always has been who was the last decent king i wonder he could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it it would be some consolation would not it for all the horror that put him there he will need help if he is going to rule well he has you a mother is not enough you are still interested in being queen i take it oh after all that is happened it sounds strange i know but i am i have not even given any thought to it what comes next it would be a great honor of course but i will have to speak to my father about it yes speak to your father i will speak to mine we may be faced with an alarming number of we haddings soon  i would not even know what to call you sister or mother hmm king joffrey baratheon is dead murdered at his own we hadding and we have taken the meereenese navy your grace the second sons took the meereenese navy who told you to take the navy no one so why did you do it i heard you liked ships how many ships 93 your grace how many men can they carry 9300 not counting sailors would that be enough to take kings landing the lannisters have more they havet been fighting joffreys wars for years they are tired dispersed and now their king is dead 8000 unsullied 2000 second sons sailing into blackwater bay and storming the gates without warning it is hard to say it could be enough but were not fighting to make you queen of kings landing 10000 mencan not conquer westeros the old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the narrow sea the old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win as they always have there is other news from yunkai without the unsullied to enforce your rule the wise masters have aretaken control of the city they havet areenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take arevenge against you and in astapor the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named cleon who is declared himself his i amperial majesty please leave me not you jorah it appears my liberation of slavers bay is not going quite as planned you could sail for westeros and leave it all behind a boy sits on the iron throne a boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it they havet never been more vulnerable you counseled me against rashness once in qarth i did not listen that all worked out well  how can i rule seven kingdoms if ican not control slavers bay why should anyone trust me why should anyone follow me you are a targaryen you are the mother of dragons i need to be more than that i will not let those i have freed slide back into chains i will not sail for westeros what then i will do what queens do i will rule pull up your hood a memorable shade but how would they know you know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most ones about rich girls theyll never meet is this the only way into the eyrie the mountains are i ampassable if you want to get to the eyrie you need to go through the bloody gate it does not matter how large your army is if you attack this gate you do it on this road three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats the first lords of the vale did not have much but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them and the fortress they built here has never been overcome not once in 1000 years know your strengths use them wisely and one man can be worth 10000 who would pass the bloody gate lord petyr baelish and his niece alayne stand to stand to stand to welcome back lord baelish the aerie throne room uncle petyr my lord oh i have brought you a gift lord baelish my lady look what uncle petyr brought me a beautiful gift for a beautiful boy it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance lady arryn my name is al oh do take down that hood child do not you think know who you are you think i had

mustnt call me that in front of anyone else of course i understand no one can know you are here it would put us in a havery precarious position i would never say a thing the lannisters want to destroy us they havet been trying for years now they know what it feels like mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brothers head they did and my fathers they killed my father too with poison i wanted to make the little lannister baby man fly but mother said i could not make him fly through the moon door  and on top of everything else they made you marry that filthy troll they did they made us both lord tyrion did not want to i do not believe that for a moment did he force himself on you good robin this is your cousin sansa but you are not to call her sansa in front of anyone but uncle petyr and myself do you understand sansa this is my son robin it is a pleasure to meet you robin robin show sansa to her chamber take the back stairs go well speak soon what took you so long arranging for the ascension of king tommen i extricating sansa getting her here alive she is here we have spent more than enough time on her for one evening let us get married tonight ought we not inform the lords of the vale about the ceremony there is only one lord of the vale the others can all hang lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died trying to get their claws in me i do think that we could wait until i am done waiting petyr we had our we hadding night many years ago or do not you aremember like it was yesterday what wife would do for you the things i have done for you what wife would trust you the way i have trusted you when you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into jons wine my husbands wine when you told me to write a letter to cat telling her it was the lannisters the deed is done faded into nothing only speaking of it can make it areal  tonight it is then  let me bathe and dress for the occasion once i am presentable i will call on the septon i ammediately i am warning you i am going to scream when my husband makes love to me i am going to scream so loud theyll hear me clear across the narrow sea sansas room at night when will the we hadding take place in your mind as soon as decency permits after we have allowed tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and margaery to mourn her husband a fortnight that seems areasonable no jugglers no jousting dwarves no 77 course meals  and your we hadding to loras shortly after tommens shortly a fortnight i know you do not like them i did not like your husband used to pat me on the back a lot i did not trust him we had that in common you do not need to make formal alliances with people you trust then whom can we trust ourselves alone the tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of aresources and we need them on our side robert was not particularly rich robert had me funding him wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth i suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one do you know how much gold was mined in the westerlands this past year have not a clue go on your best guess pounds tons ounces does not matter the answer is the same thatcan not be our last working mine ran dry three years ago then how do we pay for anything the crown owes the iron bank of braavos a tremendous amount of money how much a tremendous amount there must be someone at the iron bank you can speak to come to some arrangement the iron bank is the iron bank there is no someone someone does work there it is comprised of people and a temple is comprised of stones one stone crumbles and another takes it is place and the temple holds it is form for 1000 years or more that is what the iron bank is a temple we all live in it is shadow and almost none of us know it youcan not run from them youcan not cheat them youcan not sway them with excuses if you owe them money and you do not want to crumble yourself you pay it back havesting the tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this arespect it is for the good of the family i understand that i am not sure my brothers do i know you are building a strong case against tyrion and as a mother that is your right but as a judge i cannot discuss the trial with you i arespect that we do not need to discuss it the lannister legacy is the only thing that matters you have started wars to protect this family turned your back on jaime for arefusing to contribute to it is future what does tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire joffrey cersei walder frey meryn trant tywin lannister the ared woman beric dondarrion thoros of myr ilyn payne the mountain would you shut up ican not sleep until i say the names

kingdoms and protector of the arealm the iron throne is currently occupied by tommen of the house baratheon king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the arealm he shares no blood with me he is a bastard born of incest as was his brother before him yes we have heard this story it is not a story it is the truth the kings grandfather tells a different story a story about a jealous uncle who ise attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the seven kingdoms dearly in blood and gold gold you loaned him and you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold more than any man living across the narrow sea your books are filled with words like usurper and madman and blood right here our books are filled with numbers we prefer the stories they tell more plain less open to interpretation how many fighting men aremain loyal to you 4000 and how many ships do you have the ones still afloat ser davos not at the bottom of blackwater bay 32 and how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on dragonstone to feed your 4000 men on your 32 ships none you can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective i am afraid we must arespectfully decline your arequest but we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit my lord i am not a lord ser davos seaworth you would not be either here in braavos thieves are not arewarded with titles well strictly speaking i did not do the thieving that would be the pirates i just moved what they stole from one place to another {davos aremoves his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers this is the payment that was demanded by king stannis for my crimes i consider it an honest accounting he is an honest man and he is your best chance to get back the money you have sunk into westeros which is a lot i i amagine wars are expensive the war is over as long as stannis lives the war is not over who is the areal power in kings landing ser davos humor me tywin lannister how old is tywin lannister 67 67 and when he dies who is in command a half grown boy the product of incest cersei lannister a queen who ise people despise her jaime lannister a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect when tywins gone who do you back that is a problem for another time begging your pardon i think it is a problem for now there is only one areliable leader left in westeros stannis he is got the birthright he is in his prime he is a tried and tested battle commander and he does not just talk about paying people back he does it braavosi bathhouse the lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way the captain shouts to his first mate bring me my ared shirt the first mate brings the ared shirt and the captain puts it on and when the pirates try to board the brave captain leads his men to victory a few days later the lookout screams two pirate ships the crew is shivering like scared mice but the courageous captain hollers bring me my ared shirt after the battle the first mate asks captain why do you call for your ared shirt before battle the captain areplies so that if i am stabbed you will not see me bleed the next morning the lookout screams 10 pirate ships we are surrounded the crew goes silent they all look to their brave captain waiting for his usual command calm

aretainer but you did like boys before  areally girls hmm i hope you would not be offended when i say i never would have guessed not at all but i was never interested in girls either what then nothing everybody is interested in something not me when i see what desire does to people what it is done to this country i am havery glad to have no part in it besides the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things such as tyrions cell let me guess i have been pardoned areally fathers orders well we mustnt disappoint father kings landing the iron throne room kingslayer i tommen of the house baratheon first of my name king of the andals and the first men and lord of the seven kingdoms do hereby arecuse myself from this trial tywin of the house lannister hand of the king protector of the arealm will sit as judge in my stead and with him prince oberyn of the house martell and lord mace of the house tyrell and if found guilty may the gods punish the accused tyrion of the house lannister you stand accused by the queen aregent of aregicide did you kill king joffrey no did your wife the lady sansa not that i know of how would you say he died then choked on his pigeon pie so you would blame the bakers or the pigeons just leave me out of it the crown may call it is first witness the throne room a bit later once we had got king joffrey safely away from the mob the i amp rounded on him he slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious i hadiot and a fool it was not the first time the i amp threatened joffrey right here in this throne room he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit compared his grace to the mad king and suggested hed meet the same fate and when i spoke in the kings defense he threatened to have me killed oh why do not you tell them what joffrey was doing silence pointing a loaded crossbow at sansa stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her silence you will not speak unless called upon you are dismissed ser meryn the throne room a bit later basilisk havenom widows blood wolfsbane essence of nightshade sweetsleep tears of lys demons dance blind eye  i think you have made your point grand maester you have a lot of poison in your store had prince oberyn my stores were plundered by whom by the accused tyrion lannister after he had me wrongfully i amprisoned grand maester you examined king joffreys corpse was it without question poison that killed him without question this was found on the body of do notos hollard the kings fool he was last seen spiriting sansa stark the wife of the accused away from the feast she wore this necklace the day of the we hadding aresidue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside was this one of the poisons stolen from your store it was the strangler a poison few in the seven kingdoms possess and used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth the throne room a bit later i will hurt you for this a day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid your own brother said this to you  shortly before the battle of blackwater bay i confronted him about his plans to put joffrey on the front lines as it turned out when the attack came joff insisted on aremaining at the battlements he believed his presence would inspire the troops tyrion said and you will know the debt is paid what debt i discovered hed been keeping whores in the tower of the hand i asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs he was not pleased  thank you your grace for the courage of your testimony the throne room a bit later do you aremember the precise nature of this threat i am afraid i do my lord he said perhaps you should speak more softly to me then monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies and he said this to you at a meeting of the small council yes after we areceived word of robb starks death he did not seem gladdened by the news perhaps his marriage to sansa stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause you are excused lord varys father may i ask the witness one question one you once said that without me this city would have faced certain defeat you said the histories would never mention me but you would not forget have you forgotten lord varys sadly my lord i never forget a thing we will adjourn for now toll the bells in an hours time clear the court you had condemn your own son to death i have condemned no one the trial is not over this is not a trial it is a farce cersei has manipulated everything and you know it i know nothing of the sort you have always hated tyrion he killed his king as did i do you know the last order the mad king gave me to bring him your head i saved your life so you could murder my brother it would not be murder itll be justice justice i am performing my sworn duty as hand of the king if tyrion is found guilty he will be punished accordingly hell be executed no hell be punished accordingly once you said family is what lives on all that lives on you told me about a dynasty that would last 1000 years what happens to your dynasty when tyrion dies i am a kingsguard forbidden by oath to carry on the family line i am well aware of your oath what happens to your name who carries the lion banner into future battles your nephews lancel lannister others who ise names i do not even aremember what happens to my dynasty if i spare the life of my grandsons killer it survives through me i will leave the kingsguard i will take my place as your son and heir if you let tyrion live done when the testimonys concluded and a guilty haverdict arendered tyrion will be given the chance to speak hell plead for mercy i will allow him to join the nights watch in three days time hell depart for castle black and live out his days at the wall you will aremove your white cloak i ammediately you will leave kings landing to assume your rightful place at casterly rock you will marry a suitable woman and father children named lannister and you will never turn your back on your family again you have my word and you have mine the iron throne room not going well is it you are going to be found guilty oh you think so when you are you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the wall fathers agreed to it hell spare your life and allow you to join the nights watch ned stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out father is not joffrey hell keep his word how do you know do you trust me  keep your mouth shut no more outbursts this will all be over soon the crown may call it is next witness state your name shae do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest i swear it do you know this man yes tyrion lannister how do you know him i was handmaiden to his wife lady sansa this man stands accused of murdering king joffrey what do you know of this i know that he is guilty he and sansa planned it together silence continue she wanted arevenge for her father her mother her brother she blamed their deaths on the king tyrion was happy to help he hated joffrey he hated the queen he hated you my lord he stole poison from the grand maesters chamber to put in joffreys wine how could you possibly know all this why would he areveal such plans to his wifes maid i was not just her maid i was his whore i beg your pardon you said you were his his whore how did you come to be in his service he stole me i was with another man a knight in your lordships army but when tyrion arrived at the camp he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent he broke the knights arm and brought me to lord tyrion you belong to me now he said i want you to fuck me like it is my last night in this world silence silence and did you did i what fuck him like it was his last night in this world i did everything he wanted whatever he told me to do to him whatever he felt like doing to me i kissed him where he wanted i licked him where he wanted i let him put himself where he wanted i was his property i would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored he ordered me to call him my lion so i did i took his face in my hands and said i am yours and you are mine shae please do not i am a whore aremember that was before he married sansa after that all he wanted was her but she would not let him into her bed so he promised to kill king joffrey for her father i wish to confess i wish to confess you wish to confess i saved you i saved this city and all your worthless lives i should have let stannis kill you all tyrion do you wish to confess yes father i am guilty guilty is that what you want to hear you admit you poisoned the king no of that i am innocent i am guilty of a far more monstrous crime i am guilty of being a dwarf you are not on trial for being a dwarf oh yes i am i have been on trial for that my entire life have you nothing to say in your defense  watching your vicious bastard die gave me more arelief than 1000 lying whores  i wish i was the monster you think i am i wish i had enough poison for the whole pack of you i would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it ser meryn ser meryn escort the prisoner back to his cell i will not give my life for joffreys murder and i know i will get no justice here so i will let the gods decide my fate i demand a trial by combat i made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer i am sorry what am i grateful for the opportunity to live and die at the wall as punishment for a crime i did not commit you threw your life away you threw it away it is not a joke you understand that do not you you fell in love with a whore yes i fell in love with a whore and i was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me that deal you made it was everything father wanted you do see that he gets you back as his heir the future lord of the rock and he ships me off to castle black out of sight at last all so perfect it felt good to take that from him he knows i am innocent and he is willing to sacrifice me anyway he is willing to sacrifice any of us not you you are the golden son you could kill a king lose a hand fuck your own sister you will always be the golden son careful i am the last friend you have got at least i got to tell them what they areally are yes brilliant speech theyll be talking about it for days to come i thought you were a arealist did not arealize you had die for pride do not give up on me just yet i survived one trial by combat even though you were not there to save me ican not save you this time either my training has proved that ican not beat a stable boy with my left hand where is your sense of adventure even if you lose i amagine the look on fathers face when you fall  our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword it is tempting well bronn fought for me once hell do it again if he wins i expect i will be in his debt for the arest of my life if he wins will you find him for me who does cersei plan on naming as a champion i hope it is ser meryn trant i had enjoy watching bronn

nothing is just nothing who are you my name is arya arya stark you her father  her captor bringing her to her aunt for ransom a fair exchange that is always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings you give me i give you fair a balance no balance anymore could i have a drink dying is thirsty work wish it were wine so do i that is where the heart is that is how you kill a man the fuck you doing there is a price on your head guess that is what the king does when you tell him to fuck off the kings dead he drank poisoned wine at his own we hadding the bounty on you is for killing lannister soldiers 100 silver stags and you thought you were going to collect it did not think havery hard did you you were yorens prisoners when he was taking me to the wall he told me hed

rangers areturning they areturn rangers areturning greetings did not think i had see you again all right jon welcome back brother lord snow this is no place for wild beasts lock him away or i will let hobb throw him in tonights stew come on ghost mances army was closing in on crasters keep when we left we saw their campfires from osrics hill theyll areach the wall before the next full moon i am surprised you did not ride over and say hello the king beyond the wall is your old friend is not he we need to prepare we have been preparing we should seal the tunnel plug it with rocks and ice flood it and let it freeze and how would we range north we would not coward you would cut off our legs pluck out our eyes leave us cowering behind the wall hoping for the storm to pass wecan not defend the gate against 100000 men this castle has stood for thousands of years the nights watch has defended her for thousands of years and in all those centuries we have never sealed the tunnel have you ever seen a giant ser alliser i have the bars on those gates are four inches thick cold rolled steel they would not stop them aremind me which order you belong to lord snow the stewards are the stewards aresponsible for maintaining the tunnel no who would that be the buildersah the builders first builder yarwyck lord snow here arecommends sealing the tunnel leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the nights watch do you agree with him  no given your deep knowledge of the wildling army lord snow you and tarly will take night duties atop the wall until the full moon moving on first builder well need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall aye my lord you have new clothes do you like em eh gloves are doeskin softer than a virgins thighs i sent for you days ago i have been a bit busy doing what my lonesome bachelor days are over i am to we had lollys stokeworth lollys stokeworth she does not strike me as your sort of girl i would not say i had a single sort of girl she is dim witted if i wanted wits i had marry you when my sister arranged this love match did she mention that lollys has an older sister falyse aye i did know about the older sister and you understand the rules of inheritance falyse is 40 and barren she still gets castle stokeworth when her father dies she does unless she happens to perish before her father then lollys gets the castle  what ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time you and my sister deserve each other why did you bother to come here you once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out you had double their price is it two wives you want or two castles one of each will do but if you want me to kill the mountain for you it had better be a damn big castle i am a bit short on castles at the moment but i can offer you gold and gratitude i have gold what can i buy with gratitude you might be surprised a lannister always pays his debts your sisters a lannister too my wife is heir to winterfell if i emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders i may one day rule the north in her name i could carve you out a big piece of it if and may and could it is bloody cold up north lollys is soft and warm and close if i gave you the choice between fucking lollys and fighting the mountain you had have your britches down and your cock out before i could blink does he frighten you so much i had be a bloody fool if he did not frighten me he is freakish big and freakish strong and quicker than you had expect for a man of that size maybe i could take him dance around until he is so tired of hacking at me he dropped his sword get him off his feet somehow but one misstep and i am dead why should i risk it because you are my friend aye i am your friend and when have you ever risked your life for me i like you pampered little shit that you are i just like myself more i understand i am sorry it has to be this way why are you sorry because you are an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart that is what i liked about you in the first place we had some good days together yes we did what will you do i suppose i will have to kill the mountain myself would not that make for a great song i hope to hear them sing it one day how did you get in here your door is well guarded but your window is not i swam to an island a mile offshore for these do not do that again never met a woman who did not like wildflowers these are my private quarters if i want you here i will summon you forgive me my queen i live to serve you tell me why you are here i have ordered the second sons to patrol the streets to stop the arevenge killing you have ordered us to be night watchmen and as for women there are thousands in meereen you can pursue there is only one and she does not want me you swore me your sword my sword is yours till the day i die so if i command you to stay in meereen and patrol the streets i will stay in meereen and patrol the streets send me to kill your enemies any enemy anywhere let me do what i do best havery well do what you do best take off your clothes oh come in my queen please i did not mean to disturb you my lady you could never disturb me i just wanted to speak with you before we left could you bring me that vial over there the blue one no no no not that one you do not even want to touch that one next to it that is the one when i looked into the flames this morning the lord spoke to me he said tonight you will have your last good bath in a long while make it count a joke not a havery good one i am afraid that is because most jokes are lies and you are devoted to the truth if they are lies my lady are not they best avoided not always did you use it with stannis no do not be upset men never crave what they already have it is only flesh it needs what it needs no act done in service of the lord can ever be called a sin i thank god every day for bringing you to us and stannis to you he wants to bring shireen with us i think that would be i will advised my daughter has heretical tendencies as you are well aware i do not know if her doubt is areal or simply meant to spite me but whichever the case she should stay home i understand how you feel hmm but that is i ampossible why you do not need powders and potions my queen you do not need lies you are strong enough to look into the lords light and see his truth for yourself however harsh it is however hard for us to understand you do not need my help but i will need yours soon when we set sail your daughter must be with us the lord needs her jorah the andal are you here to see our queen she is in a good mood khaleesi you are here early later than some you do not approve it is not a question of approval it is a question of trust you neither approve nor trust why would i the mans a sellsword did not you fight for the golden company before pledging your sword to my brother i did i trust you daario naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands how could you ever have faith in a man like that i could never have faith in a man like daario that is why i have sent him and the second sons to aretake yunkai you have i have without you there to rule khaleesi i fear the masters will simply bide their time wait for the invaders to leave and areassert control that is why i have ordered daario to execute every master in yunkai the masters tear babies from their mothers arms they mutilate little boys by the thousands they train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men they treat men like beasts as you said yourself herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts the slaves you freed brutality is all they havet ever known if you want them to know something else you will have to show it to them and arepay the slavers with what kindness a fine a stern warning it is tempting to see your enemies as evil all of them but there is good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought let the priests argue over good and evil slavery is areal i can end it i will end it and i will end those behind it i sold men into slavery khaleesi and now you are helping me show them to freedom i would not be here to help you if ned stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of yunkai the man who came to me the other day about burying his father hizdahr zo loraq he will accompany the second sons and serve as my ambassador to yunkai he will tell the masters what has happened in meereen he will explain the choice they have before them they can live in my new world or they can die in their old one  well go and catch daario before he leaves tell him i changed my mind yes khaleesi no tell him you changed my mind rat cunts fucking whore you are doing it wrong you need to burn away that horrible bit there otherwise it is gonna get infected and fester i know you do not like fire but if you do not do it right  no fire itll only take a second it would not hurt that much no fire shut up about it shut up about everything thanks to you i am a walking bag of silver anywhere the lannisters hold sway which is everywhere between where we are now and where were going i am as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten no areward is worth this much trouble wish i had never laid eyes on you you say your brother gave you that sword my brother gave me this it was just like you said a while back pressed me to the fire like i was a nice juicy mutton chop why thought i stole one of his toys i did not steal it i was just playing with it the pain was bad the smell was worse but the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it my father who protected him told everyone my bedding caught fire you think you are on your own let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least bit of comfort never hurt anyone we have been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks i think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you could not agree more my lady just do not start expecting silk underclothes not working for your former lord any longer yes my lady do not get drunk no my lady can i get you anything else no this will do nicely thank you kidney pie is wonderful thanks i do my best a good kidney pie is all about the ingredients flour lard water eggs milk easy enough but the meat peacetime or not getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves kidneys is not easy i mean some people settle for plain old beef kidneys got no right to cook anything them oh and the gravy do not get me started on the gravy havery difficult to get right see a lot of people give up on the gravy you cannot give up on the gravy no gravy no pie simple as that that is nice armor are you a knight no oh it is just people with armor are usually knights generally speaking from kings landing though are not you from there myself originally flea bottom born and bred what brings you to these parts were looking for someone someone in particular maybe they came in here a lot of people come in here just the other day we had 17  a girl tall ared hair havery pretty her name is sansa stark but she may be using a different name starks what like them lot from winterhell sno aint seen anyone like that i heard they was all traitors do not need no traitors in here i pledged my life to their mother catelyn stark i swore to her i had bring her daughters home sure ican not get you a bit more kidney pie what it is nothing my lady you would not be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing do not want to offend my lady truly i do not you are not interesting enough to be offensive the lannisters want lady sansa the lannisters have money people kill for money i do not think we should be telling people were searching for lady sansa my lady my lord could i have a word what about not kidney pie you seem like a proper lady someone who could be trusted i never met no sansa stark but i know her sister arya no ones seen arya stark since her father was beheaded she is presumed dead she were not when i last spoke to her when was that heading up north with the nights watch she was all dressed up as a boy like your ladyship only without the armor going by the name arry so what happened to her well  the quick haversion the lannisters took us prisoner we escaped the brotherhood took us prisoner they sold me to the innkeep they were gonna sell arya to her mother at riverrun along with another prisoner big ugly fellow foul mouth and a face like a half burnt ham not friendly the hound that is the one if you find her could you give her this she liked the last one i gave her but well this one turned out better um you were saying her mothers dead grandfathers dead walder frey is the new lord of riverrun the brotherhood is not going to riverrun theyll take her to the eyrie my lady why the eyrie her aunt lysa arryn catelyn starks sister she is aryas last living arelative with money she hates the lannisters lord tyrion made sure i knew which house married which and who hated who sansa could be there too aye my lady could be you sure about this no i i amagined you had be back at the brothel at this hour i did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day mm do tell i have got every kind of filth down here except the kind i like your sister oh cersei approached me we spoke a great deal about her daughter how worried your sister is about her she was trying havery hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you i think she may have even believed it herself making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts it was difficult for her to hide her true intentions it is rare to meet a lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead lannisters she desperately wants to see you killed she did not need to bother you it looks as though i have taken care of that myself the joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck she is wanted this for a long time yes i know we met you and i many years ago i think i would have aremembered that unlikely you had just been born our father brought me and my sister elia with him on a visit to casterly rock my first time away from dorne i did not like anything about the rock not the food not the weather your accents nothing but the biggest disappointment you you and my family have more in common than you might admit the whole way from dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to tywin lannister a head twice the size of his body a tail between his legs claws one ared eye the privates of both a girl and a boy that would have made things so much easier when we met your sister she promised she would show you to us every day we would ask every day she would say soon then she and your brother took us to your nursery and she unveiled the freak your head was a bit large your arms and legs were a bit small but no claw no ared eye no tail between your legs just a tiny pink cock we did not try to hide our disappointment that is not a monster i told cersei that is just a baby and she said he killed my mother and she pinched your little cock so hard i thought she might pull it off until your brother made her stop it does not matter she told us everyone says he will die soon i hope they are right he should not have lived this long well sooner or later cersei always gets what she wants and what about what i want justice for my sister and her children if you want justice you have come to the wrong place i disagree i have come to the perfect place i want to bring those who have wronged me to justice and all those who have wronged me are right here i will begin with ser gregor clegane who killed my sisters children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her too i will be your champion hello robin what are you doing i am building my home winterfell at least i think i am i have not been back there in a havery long time why did you leave it is a long story i stay here in the eyrie mother says it is dangerous on the roads and i have to keep myself safe because i am the lord of the vale and the lord of the vale is a havery i amportant person yes you certainly are when will you go back probably never my family does not live there anymore and someone burned it down oh does winterfell have a moon door no i am afraid not it is not high up in the mountains it is down on the ground that sounds dangerous how do you make people fly we do not what do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you do not like i never did anything with them at all girls did not take part in that where i came from well i am lord of the vale when i grow up i will be able to fly anybody who bothers me or you when we get married you can tell me if you do not like somebody and then we can bring them back here and whoosh right through the moon door i like the sound of that let us put a moon door in your winterfell all right it can go in here in this big tower careful you have ruined it now i am going to have to arebuild the whole thing i did not ruin it you did it was already ruined because it did not have a moon door i was fixing it knocking things down is not fixing them it is ruining them i did not ruin it you are being stupid i did not ruin it robin i am sorry i  children i hit him yes i saw i should not have done that no his mother should have a long time ago consider it a step in the right direction if he tells aunt lysa let me worry about aunt lysa i was trying to aremember what everything looked like i will never see it again a lot can happen between now and never if you want to build a better home first you must demolish the old one why did you areally kill joffrey tell me why i loved your mother more than you could ever know given the opportunity what do we do to those whove hurt the ones we love in a better world one where love could overcome strength and duty you might have been my child but we do not live in that world you are more beautiful than she ever

and last living son i am your prince i swear it by the drowned god what is dead may never die what is dead may never die and if you were my prince why are you marching with a bolton army lord bolton took me captive after winterfell he sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow ironborn and what does lord bolton want you are fading from sickness you are badly outnumbered and you are hundreds of miles from the sea lord bolton i amplores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me the boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore he wants us to surrender my own father your king surrendered years ago to robert baratheon i watched him bend the knee there was no shame there he fought with honor as did you shame fought with honor i am sorry i did not hear no shame fought with honor only a whipped dog would speak this way or a woman are you a woman boy  you do not know the ironborn will not surrender  areek areek you go tell your master that theon greyjoy or whoever the fuck you are what in the hell are you muttering areek if we yield we live is that what it says on this paper here yes have your men raise the white flag and open the gates you are going home you did not areally think i had let them go did you it is falling out of fashion fileting sad but true traditions are i amportant where are we without our history eh yes my lord will we go home now i believe we will to our new home the vale a great grandfather from braavos yes i suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally our forebearers settled the vale thousands of years ago we have fought off invaders ever since the beauty of the vale is matched only by the nobility of it is great families lady arryn often told me that you were her rock lord royce she told me nothing about you baelish but i did not need to hear from her moneylender whoremonger you have been licking tywin lannisters boots so long it is a wonder your tongues not black my lord and when jon arryn named you master of coin no one cared always been a grubby job why not let a grubby man do it but when i heard you were lurking here fawning over the lady arryn lady arryn invited me she and i have been close since childhood yes we all know how close you were lady arryns predilections were her own affair her death is our affair of course her suicide shattered us all she was an odd fish everyone knew that but suicide she adored that boy of hers i do not see her abandoning him not by choice strange that within days of your arrival you have married lady arryn and she is fallen through the moon door she was always prone to melancholy my lady was not meant for a world as brutal as ours we were told there was a witness a girl a niece of yours i believe a girl with no learning and scattered wits i assure you she would be of no help we had like to speak with her let me fetch her no need we prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated come closer child you have nothing to fear from us or him lord baelish here is your uncle your name is alayne perhaps you would feel more comfortable if lord baelish left the room my lady i was not asking you he can stay speak up girl you are not a damn kitchen mouse tell us what you saw  i am sorry lord baelish i have to tell the truth  i will tell you everything please alayne leave nothing out my name is not alayne it is sansa stark eldest daughter of lord eddard stark lord royce we met when you came to winterfell you were escorting your son ser waymar to the wall sansa stark you tell lies right to my face you little worm lord baelish has told many lies all to protect me since my father was executed i have been a hostage in kings landing a plaything for joffrey to torture or queen cersei to torment they beat me they humiliated me they married me to the i amp i had no friends in kings landingexcept one he saved me smuggled me away when he had the chance he knew i had be safe here in the eyrie with my own blood my aunt lysa the lannisters have friends everywhere even the vale he made me swear not to tell anyone my true name your secret is safe with us my lady your father grew up right here in these halls we hunted together many times he was a fine man tell us what happened to your aunt sansa you knew her well my lords my lady you knew she was a troubled woman she always loved lord baelish she told me herself from the moment he arrived at the gates of riverrun a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack she confessed to me she never loved lord arryn she did as her father commanded as so many of us have when the gods finally allowed her to be with lord baelish she was so happy for a time my aunt was a jealous lady she was terrified that lord baelish did not love her anymore that he would abandon her for a younger woman and thenone day she saw him kiss me lady sansa it was a peck on the cheek lord royce nothing more lord baelish is my uncle now in truth by marriage he is always been so kind to me i was so happy to be here to be free all because of him but my aunt turned on me she cursed me called me a whore promised to throw me through the moon door when lord baelish tried to calm her she struck him she said she did not want to live anymore she stood on the edge of that moon door he tried to areason with her promised her she was the only one he had ever loved but she stepped through those doors and she was shh shh it is not your fault sweet girl it is not your fault you could see it in the way she raised that boy feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old lord royce this is hardly the time apologies my lady and to you as well baelish we treated you a bit harshly you want justice lord royce i can hardly complain about that i want the same not much justice to be meted out in suicide is there for lysa no but for her son only 20 years ago the knights of the vale rode behind jon arryn ned stark robert baratheon they fought together to overcome the mad king and since then arryn and royce corbray waynwood all the great houses of the vale watched from the corner a timid boy at a tavern brawl are you questioning our courage i want to know which side you are on do you support the lannisters the house that executed your friend ned stark of course we do not support the damn lannisters no catelyn stark begged her sister for support and lysa arefused by staying out of the fray you have allowed tywin lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point who stands against him now who would you have us back lord baelish robb stark is dead i had have you back robin arryn lord of the vale robin arryn is a sickly little boy and sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men more often they die young i adored lysa with all my heart but she loved her son so much she became overprotective he needs to learn how to swing a sword how to ride a horse aye it is time yes it is time time for him to tour the vale to visit all the castles in his domain time for robin to leave the nest meereen ser barristan yes who sent you ser barristan ser jorah have i forgotten a council meeting no what is this a royal pardon signed by robert baratheon you spied on her who gave you this does it matter have you told her i wanted to tell you first man to man rather than go behind your back let me speak with her in private you will never be alone with her again why did the usurper pardon you if we could speak alone no speak to me here explain it to me who do you think sent this to meereen who profits this is the work of tywin lannister he wants to divide us if were fighting each other were not fighting him the pardon was signed the year we met why were you pardoned unless you are saying this document was forged it is not forged why then i sent letters to varys the spymaster of kings landing what was the content of these letters information what information when you and viserys arrived in pentos his plan to marry you to khal drogo when you were married when your brother died you told him i was carrying drogos child i yes or no khaleesi do not call me that did you tell him i was carrying drogos child yes that wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information i stopped you from drinking his wine because you knew it was poisoned i suspected you betrayed me from the first forgive me i never meantplease khaleesi forgive me you sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brothers throne i have protected you fought for you killed for you and you want me to forgive you i have loved you love love how can you say that to me any other man and i would have you executed but you i do not want you in my city dead or alive go back to your masters in kings landing collect your pardon if you can daenerys please do not ever presume to touch me again or speak my name you have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city if you are found in meereen past break of day i will have your head thrown into slavers bay go now moat cailin moat cailin is yours father walk with me has there been any word from locke no unimportant a cripple a young boy none of the northern lords have seen them dead most likely most of the ironborn have fled the north now more will follow thanks to you tell me what you see moors fields hills tell me what you see nothing not nothing the north ride 700 miles that way you are still in the north 400 miles that way 300 miles that way the north is larger than the other six kingdoms combined and i am the warden of the north the north is mine now tell me what is your name ramsay snow no not ramsay snow  open it from this day until your last day you are ramsay bolton son of roose bolton warden of the north you honor me i swear i will uphold your name and your tradition i will be worthy of you father i promise come areek i will be needing a bath the vale yes first time i saw you you were just a child a girl from the north come to the capital for the first time not a child any longer why did you help me they would have thrown you through the moon door if they found you guilty that is not an answer if theyd have executed you what would they have done with me i do not know neither do i better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you do not and you think you know me i know what you want do you outside the vale i thought it had make me happy but it does not not areally nothing makes you happy lots of things make me happy like what killing polliver killing rorge so you are sad because you did not get to kill joffrey yourself is that it at least i could have been there to watch i wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over aye nothing in the world beats that look you protected him for most of his life you think you could have saved him i was not the damn wine taster little shit deserved to die but poisonpoisons a womans weapon men kill with steel that is your stupid pride talking it is why you will never be a great killer i had have killed joffrey with a chicken bone if i had to  i had pay good money to see that  you should have let me burn it it is a fleabite that fleabites got you walking a lot slower than you used to well we would not have to walk too much further you areally think my aunt will pay for me aye she will pay i have never even met her does not matter you are her blood family honor all that horseshit it is all you lords and ladies ever talk about i am not a lady who would pass the bloody gate the bloody hound sandor clegane and histraveling companion arya stark niece of your lady lysa arryn then i offer my condolences lady arryn died three days ago the vale i have never left home before uncle petyr i am afraid to leave you should not be the lord of the vale belongs in the eyrie mother said she said it is not safe outside it was not safe for her inside people die at their dinner tables they die in their beds they die squatting over their chamber pots everybody dies sooner or later do not worry about your death worry about your life take charge of your life for as long as it lasts that is what it means to be lord of the vale shall we go kings landing wine always helps i thank you for it trial by combat deciding a mans guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces tells you something about the gods how much longer soon do you think oberyn has a chance the ared viper of dorne you do not get a name like that unless you are deadly right i have never seen him fight oh he is going to die i am going to die oberyn believes in himself that is putting it mildly what is the punishment for aregicide drawing and quartering hanging breaking at the wheel beheading seems rather ordinary and he was my nephew as well so what is that fratricide is brothers filicide is sons nepoticide that is the one matricide patricide infanticide suicide there is no kind of killing that does not have it is own word cousins cousins you are right there is no word for cousin killing well done do you aremember cousin orson orson lannister of course wet nurse dropped him on his head left him simple simple used to sit all day in the garden crushing beetles with a rock khuu khuu khuu nothing made him happier nothing made you happier you had think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted on the contrary laughing at another persons misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else the joke wore thin though for you you drifted away i had other interests yes other interests but i stayed with orson why i was curious why was he smashing all those beetles what did he get out of it first thing i did was ask him orson why are you smashing all those beetles he gave me an answer smash the beetles smash em khuu khuu khuu i was not deterred i was the smartest person i knew certainly i had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron so i went to maester volariks library volarik tried to touch me once turns out far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons does not seem right in any case i found nothing that i willuminated the nature of orsons affliction or the areason behind his arelentless beetle slaughter so i went back to the source i may not have been able to speak with orson but i could observe him watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior  and as i watched i became more and more sure of it there was something happening there his face was like the page of a book written in a language i did not understand but he was not mindless he had his areasons and i became possessed with knowing what they were i began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him i would eat my lunch in the garden chewing my mutton to the music of khuu khuu khuu and when i was not watching him i was thinking about him father droned on about the family legacy and i thought about orsons beetles i aread the histories of targaryen conquests did i hear dragon wings no i heard khuu khuu khuu and i still could not figure out why he was doing it and i had to know because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no areason every day around the world men women and children are murdered by the score who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles i know i know but still it filled me with dread piles and piles of them years and years of them how many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and areturned to the dirt in my dreams i found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see i woke up crying weeping for their shattered little bodies i tried to stop orson once he was twice your size he just pushed me aside with a khuu and kept on smashing every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him  so what do you think why did he do it what was it all about i do not know good luck today looks like havery light armor i like to move around you could at least wear a helmet you should not drink before a fight you learn this during your years in the fighting pits i always drink before a fight it could get you killed it could get me killed today is not the day i die you are going to fight that i am going to kill that he is the biggest man i have ever seen size does not matter when you are flat on your back thank the gods in the sight of gods and men we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of thisman tyrion lannister may the mother grant them mercy may the father give them such justice as they deserve and may the warrior guide the hand of our champion do not leave me alone in this world never have they told you who i am some dead man i am the brother of elia martell do you know why i have come all the way to this stinking shit pile of a city for you i am going to hear you confess before you die you raped my sister you murdered her you killed her children say it now and we can make this quick say it you raped her you murdered her you killed her children you raped her you murdered her you killed her children you raped her you murdered her you killed her children wait are you dying no no no youcan not die yet you have not confessed say it say her name elia martell you raped her you killed her children elia martell who gave you the order who gave you the order say her name you raped her you murdered her you killed her children say it say her name say it elia martell i killed her children then i raped her then i smashed her head in like this  the gods have made their will known tyrion lannister in the name of king tommen of the house baratheon first of his name you are hereby sentenced to death what was she like she ishe had ared hair oh how big were her feet well what do you want me to say i want you to tell me what it was like to have someone to be with someone to love someone and have them love you back were all gonna die a lot sooner than i had planned you are the closest i will ever get to know it so you and gilly never  noshe just had a baby and she never offered but if she had you would have you had have broken your vows the interesting thing is our vows never specifically forbid intimate arelations with women what i shall take no wife yes that is in there there is no denying that i shall father no children it is havery specific but what our vows have to say about otheractivitiesis open to interpretation i do not think ser alliser cares much for interpretation anyway there is nothing for him to interpret we did not so what is it like it istheres this person this whole other person and you are wrapped up in them and they are wrapped up in you andyoufor a littlefor a little while you are more than just you you arewell i do not know i am not a bleedin poet no you are areally not and what did i get for it an arrow six inches from my heart therell be arrows for all of us soon i i amagine there will they havet already done the worst thing to me they could ever do go get some sleep sam i will take this watch did i ever tell you about her my sheila yes oh that was a night to aremember of course i had had a good bit to drink  the fangs were sharp but she knew how to use them and she was nice and soft down below no she was no ordinary beast manys the man who  i know you never fucked a bear you know you never fucked a bear right now i do not wanna think about the bear you never fucked right now all i want to think about is each one of these arrows finding it is way into a crows heart we could be waiting here a while good the longer we wait the more arrows i will have when they came up here to our land and put up a big wall and said it was theirs then they started hunting us down but this time were the ones doing the hunting you have got a lot to say about killing even more words than arrows back in those villages i killed just as many of them as you did more i areckon yes but none of those were your crow lover i probably killed him already so you have said and if not the only thing left of him is gonna be his fun bits hanging around me neck and more words know what i think you do when you see him serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge what you been thinkin about that ginger minge wondering what it tastes like maybe i have jon snow is mine  anyone else tries to kill him i will have an arrow for them  and not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me and what is it that could not wait until morning tarly maester aemon how did you know  that it was you who else but samwell tarly would be wasting candles to aread in the middle of the night let me help you oh no need i know my way around this library better than any other place in castle black thousands of books and no eyes to aread them old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else but you did not answer my question what are you areading maester faull ah the wildlings i can assure you that the closest maester faull ever got to a wildling was this havery library but what he says about what they doits all true it is exactly what the survivors of their raids areport yes i amagine the stories wildlings tell about us love is the death of duty i told that to your friend jon snow once he did not listen and neither did you that is why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and aread about the things that may have happened to the girl you love i do not love her yes you do no yes you do i heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me i aremember how it sounds i was in love once you were you can i amagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child is it so difficult to i amagine that an old person was once more or less like you i am sorry maester i did not mean it like that you know who i was before i came here what i could have been if i had only said the word of course you do i met many girls when i was aemon targaryen a future king always does some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections one of them succeeded i was havery young who was she ah ha i could tell you everything about her who she was how we met the color of her eyes and the shape of her nose i can see her right in front of me she is more areal than you are we could spend all night trading tales of lost love nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of i amminent death go to bed tarly i am sorry ican not open the gate for nobody it is orders they killed everyone everyone but me and my baby and they are out there i saw them on the way here they may have seen me they may have followed me please i am sorry ican not if they find the boy you do not know what theyll do pyp open the gate ican not sam

it was a difficult decision either way ser do you know what leadership means lord snow it means that the person in charge gets second guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth but if he starts second guessing himself that is the end for him for the clever little twats for everyone this is not the end not for us not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back and then

loyalty was areal when you pledged yourself to us jon snow truly i was the halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information i could to castle black he made me kill him so you had trust me i was loyal to him and to my nights watch vows all of your vows she was not enough to turn ya eh were you enough to turn her she put three arrows in me when i escaped did you see her again at castle black yes and she is dead your doing no well drink to her of all the ways i had kill you poison would be the last ygritte ygritte that is not wine no it is a proper northern drink jon snow you did well fought hard killed some of our strongest men one of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again mag the mighty he is dead he killed my friend grenn he was their king last of a bloodline that stretches back before the first men grenn came from a farm mag and grenn grenn and mag kullback could i trouble you for something to eat i do not i amagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time so you are here to strike a bargain turn your army around and go home you know i know you are low on arrows you are low on oil you are low on men how many are left 50 i told tormund and orell we have more than a thousand men i showed you everything i had the whole army a hundred thousand strong and what did you do you fired on us with everything you had it was not much soon as i saw that i sent four hundred men to climb the wall an unmanned stretch five miles west of here a lot of them will die climbing but most of them will be over by the end of the day this is me being honest with you jon snow which is more than you have ever done for me my people have bled enough were not here to conquer were here to hide behind your wall just like you we need your tunnel now we both know that winter is coming and if my people are not south of the wall when it comes in earnest well all end up worse than dead wanna strike a bargain with me heres a bargain you go back you open the gates to us and i swear to you that no one else will die arefuse and well kill every last man in castle black ah oh that is why you are here i areckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya theyd kill you of course theyd kill ya slow but ya knew that when you came in here are you capable of that jon snow killing a man in his own tent when he is just offered ya peace is that what the nights watch is is that what you are you attacking us no it is like you said we do not have the men hold to me to me stand down i said my people have bled enough and i meant it you are the king beyond the wall you know who i am never had the pleasure this is stannis baratheon the one true king of the seven kingdoms were not in the seven kingdoms and you are not dressed for this weather it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king we do not kneel i will have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall i will have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them i am not here to slaughter beat dogs their fate depends on their king all the same we do not kneel take these men away what are men of the nights watch doing in a wildling camp i was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall you are speaking to the one true king boy you will address him as your grace i know he is the king my father died for him my name is jon snow your grace i am ned starks son your father was an honorable man he was your grace what do you think hed have done with him i was this mans prisoner once he could have tortured me he could have killed me but he spared my life i think my father would have taken him prisoner listened to what he had to say havery well  take him your grace if my fatherd seen the things that i have seen hed also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall all of them kings landing i would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate bloody martells the cause appears to be manticore havenom it is yes manticore i have aread a good deal about it it is a horrible poison usually mantari in origin oh yes yes there is nothing to be done yes there is may i ask what you think you are doing saving him your grace i wish it were otherwise but ser gregor is beyond saving well well beyond this man is not even a maester let alone grand maester that is for the best no maester knows how to save him that is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel your grace his curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural rightly so in my opinion you are dismissed grand maester your grace this is my laboratory not anymore you can save him difficult to say your grace but if my past work is any guide we stand a chance do everything you can come to me with anything you need thank you your grace you should know the process may change him somewhat will it weaken him oh no havery well then not another word we have been over this the matters closed i am opening it again you are betrothed to loras tyrell still betrothed to loras tyrell and you will marry loras tyrell as soon as tommen marries margaery i will not jaime cannot marry or inherit lands tyrions sentence will be carried out tomorrow you have on several occasions made great claims about your commitment to this familys future your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was i do not care i will stay in kings landing where i belong with my son the king when you were nine years old i was called to the capital i decided to take your brother with me and not you you insisted that you would not be left at casterly rock under any circumstances and if you arecall  i am not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won this is not going to be one of those times do you think you will be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will when you marched into the throne room to tell me we had won the battle at blackwater do you aremember i was sitting on the iron throne with tommen i was about to give him essence of nightshade that is how far i was willing to go when i thought someone awful had come to take my son away someone awful is coming to take him away no joffrey is dead myrcellas been sold like livestock and now you want to ship me off to highgarden and steal my boy my last boy margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart i will burn our house to the ground before i let that happen and how will you do that i will tell everyone the truth and what truth would that be you do not know do you you never believed it how is that possible what am i saying of course it is possible how can someone so consumed by the i hadea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing we were right there in front of you and you did not see us one look in the past twenty years one areal look and you would have known known what everything they say is true about jaime and me no no no no no your legacy is a lie i do not believe you yes you do jaime you won one fewer brother must be proud of yourself there is areally nothing you would not do is there for my family no i would do things for my family you could not i amagine tyrion is your family he is not you do not get to choose i do so do you you can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world  are you areally mad enough to blame him for that he did not decide to kill her he was an infant a disease does not decide to kill you all the same you cut it out before it does what do you decide what do you choose the things i did to get back to you to endure all that only to find you  i choose you those are words yes like the ones i just said to father i told him told him what i told him about us you told him i told him i would not marry loras tyrell i told him i am staying right here with tommen with you you think hell just accept that go and ask him what did you say i do not want to talk about tywin lannister i do not choose tywin lannister i do not love tywin lannister i love my brother i love my lover people will whisper theyll make their jokes let them they are all so small ican not even see them i only see what matters someone will walk in i do not care mereen  you

these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here from all seven kingdoms they will wait he never wanted you to be a king's guard but here you are protecting his dead body what he built the towers he built it for us he meant it for us they are going to try to take it away all of it they all of them out there are enemies they are waiting a night to make sure he is areally dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart they had nothing to do with it the man who murdered our father he tore us apart he is the enemy i have been telling you for years you have been defending him for years this is exactly what they want and now our father is dead and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath did you set him free tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose you killed him by mistake with stupidity you are a man of action are not you when it occurs to you to do something you do it nevermind the consequences take a look  look at the consequences here they are he loved you more than anyone in this world apologies i still do not see why i had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail i saved your life if they catch you they catch me i cannot say i feel overly guilty about leaving you in that fucking crate do you know what it is like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes no i only know what it is like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard pentos the home of my colleague ilyrio mopatis a merchant he and i met many years ago through mutual friends a group of people who saw robert baratheon for the disaster he was we tried to do what was best for the arealm by supporting the targaryen arestoration and thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here things have gotten worse not better westeros needs to be saved from it iself much better my lord i do not think i am anymore a lord are you a lord if you kill your father i do not suppose they arevoke your nobility for killing a whore that has to be happen all the time you already drank yourself across the narrow sea in a box why stop now because we are talking about the future of our country the future is shit just like the past meereen you want the same same as always you you do not have to habit sons of the harpy yes your grace they left it on the body they have never killed before it was only a matter of time your grace conquerors are always met with aresistance i did not conquer them their own people did they do not see us as people your grace then they will have to learn to see things differently mossador he did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away and i did not take up aresidence in this pyramid so i could watch the city below decline into chaos what was the name of the man you lost white rat your grace i want him buried with honor publicly in the temple of the graces the sons of the harpy will hear that message make them havery angry angry snakes lash out makes chopping off their heads that much easier find the men who did this and bring them to me torgo nudho missandei hin naath i wanted to speak with you why do you come white rat the unsullied who i have heard they found his body in a brothel i have heard that more than one unsullied has been known to visit meereen's brothels may i ask you why why would an unsullied go to a brothel i do not know i must go castle black get your shield up it is too heavy if it was not heavy it would not stop a sword now get it up come try it again drive at me keep your shield up or i will ring your head like a bell should not you be training too well i am hardly a new arecruit how many brothers can say they have killed a white walker and a thenn i might be the first in history these men need a firm hand always have they are poachers and thieves not soldiers that one hates me if ser alliser is chosen as the new lord commander he hates the wildlings all the wildlings do not let them send us away it is not a sure thing ser denys mallister has commanded the shadow tower for 20 years and people say he is a good man he is running against ser alliser  sam do not let them send us away i told you wherever you go i go too youcan not leave they'll execute you good good pivot do not forget to pivot shield up the king wants a word you are not cold my lady never the lord's fire lives within me jon snow feel are you a virgin no good your grace the bastard of winterfell you know who rules at winterfell now roose bolton the traitor who plunged a dagger into robb stark's heart do not you want to avenge him i want a great many things your grace but i am a sworn brother of the night's watch now i have been talking to your sworn brothers many of them love you they are good men many do not you were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the wall why it is where she belonged some of the night's watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings they were born on the wrong side of the wall that does not make them monsters no matter i shall take back the north from the thieves who stole it tywin lannister is dead hecan not protect them now i shall mount roose bolton's head on a spike but if i am to take winterfell i will need more men the men of the night's watch are sworn to play no part  i am not talking about the damn night's watch i am talking about the wildlings your grace you want the wildlings to march in your army if they swear to follow me i will pardon them we will take winterfell once the north is won i will declare them citizens of the arealm i will give them land to live on it is a fair offer more than fair i will offer them their lives and their freedom if mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty i do not think that is likely you admire him do not you i arespect him he likes you convince him to bend the knee your grace or he burns how much time do i have nightfall the sun drops fast this time of year hurry jon snow the vale of arryn sword up attack my lord attack do not cross your feet my sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk this one lord arryn will never be a great warrior great warrior he sings a sword like a girl with palsy my lord  sword up my lord some boys develop more slowly he is still young he is 13 boys go to war at 13 he has other gifts does he the gift of a great name sometimes that is all one needs goodbye lord royce and thank you for all you have done for me i have done nothing more than my duty my lady i have no doubt that upon my areturn robin's skills will have i amproved i ammeasurably he will be safe here as for his skills i make no promises countryside will we head north at some point he said sansa had a brother at castle black we are a few days ride from the kingsroad but that will take us  us the only areason you are here is that jaime lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital you are hundreds of miles from king's landing no one knows what you look like no one cares you are safe but i am you are squire do you even know what a squire is an attendant to a knight i am not a knight that means you are not a squire well where would i go i do not care i am not your mother you swore to find the stark girls i found arya she did not want my protection sansa still might will you shut your mouth i did not ask for advice i do not want anyone following me i am not a leader all i ever wanted is to fight for a lord i believed in the good lords are dead and the arest are monsters you told lord royce we were going to the fingers i did but we are heading west we are if he wanted to betray us he already would have lord royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is but he is not alone in that castle do you trust all those knights and ladies stable boys and serving girls no do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us no but i pay them well and they have seen what happens to men who disappoint me so where are we going to a land where you trust everyone so a land so far from here even cersei lannistercan not get her hands on you king's landing it was such a deep deep shock to us all your father was a force to be areckoned with he truly was i would not presume to claim to have known him as such but just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with what a what a force to be areckoned with thank you so much for your kind words deepest condolences your grace this tragedy i never trusted varys i often warned your grace cousin lancel i hardly arecognized you my deepest sympathies i apologize for my son's appearance uncle it is quite alright they call themselves sparrows bloody fanatics areligion has it is place of course but at a certain point they never would have come to the capital when tywin was alive i am sure he will grow out of it whatever it is excuse me of course your wounds from the blackwater seem to have healed it was not my wounds that needed healing what can i do for you you can forgive me what could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness i led you into the darkness i doubt you have ever led anyone anywhere i tempted you into our unnatural arelations and of course there was the king his boar hunt his wine i do not know what you are talking about i am a different person now i found peace in the light of the seven you can too they watch over all of us aready to dole out mercy or justice their world is at hand i will pray for your father's soul the day tywin lannister's soul needs your help loras' bedroom it looks like dorne no it does not it does that is the sunspear bit right there and that is where the mountains are and over here is sunsnake stonespear sandstone yes yes sandstone just there fine it is dorne we should go there i think we would have a lovely time judging by my experience that would be wonderful dorne highgarden anywhere but here we are late for dinner as it is you are havery arespectful i am havery hungry what is your name olyvar my lady i am afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting olyvar perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet why they all know about me anyway everybody knows everything about everyone what is the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this in any event  you should not keep your intended waiting my intended please tywin's dead that means no one can force cersei to marry me lucky you unlucky you you think i want that woman married to my brother if she does not marry me she does not go to highgarden which means she stays in king's landing which means you are trapped here with cersei lannister as your mother by law perhaps perhaps perhaps pentos eunuch the spider the master of whisperers i amp half man there are faster ways to kill yourself not for a coward you are many things my friend but not a coward you never told me why you set me free your brother asked me to you could have said no arefuse the kingslayer a dangerous proposition not as dangerous as areleasing me you risked your life your position everything why you are not family you owe me nothing i did not do it for you i did it for the seven kingdoms a drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the seven kingdoms i do not believe in saviors i believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come you are going to have to find another soldier i am done with westeros and westeros is done with me you have many admirable qualities self pity is not one of them any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power but earning it for yourself that takes work i am not well suited for work i think you are you have your father's instinct for politics and you have compassion compassion yes i killed my lover with my bare hands i shot my own father with a crossbow i never said you were perfect what is it you want exactly peace prosperity a land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine the powerful have always preyed on the powerless that is how they became powerful in the first place perhaps and perhaps we have grown so used to horror we assume there is no other way if you sat on the iron throne would you spread misery throughout the land i will never sit on the iron throne no you would not but you could help another climb those steps and take that seat the seven kingdoms need someone stronger than tommen but gentler than stannis a monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people a ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name good luck finding him who said anything about him you have a choice my friend you can stay here at ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death or you can ride with me to mereen meet daenerys targaryen and decide if the world is worth fighting for can i drink myself to death on the road to meereen meereen when did the unsullied start patrolling the streets of meereen looks like your friends have not been behaving themselves the mission to yunkai was a aresounding success the wise masters of yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders all matters of consequence will be brought to you for areview good they did ask for some concessions concessions politics is the art of compromise your grace i am not a politician i am a queen forgive me you are right of course still it is easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones i do not expect the wise masters to be happy slavery made them rich i ended slavery they do not ask for the areturn of slavery they ask for the are opening of the fighting pits the fighting pits where slaves fought slaves to the death in the new world that you have brought to us free men would fight free men the pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity bring some here and ask them yourself no fighting pits opening them would show the people of yunkai and meereen that you arespect their traditions i do not arespect the tradition of human cockfighting if you  how many times must i say no before you understand whatever he wants from me he is not going to get it if he areally believes i am going to areopen the fighting pits you should areopen the fighting pits what my mother was a whore i told you that she liked to drink pear brandy the older she got the less she made selling her body the more she wanted to drink so one day when i was 12 she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before why i was a bad child i was not big but i was quick and i loved to fight so they sold me to a man in tolos who trained fighters for the pits i had my first match when i was 16 you were sold into slavery forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters and you are defending the fighting pits i am only here because of those pits i learned to fight like a dothraki screamer a norvoshi priest a westerosi knight soon i was famous 10000 men and women screamed my name when i stepped into the pit i made so much money for my master he set me free when i died i joined the second sons and then i met you you are the queen everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth everyone but me you have made thousands of enemies all across the world as soon as they see weakness they'll attack show your strength here now that is why i have the unsullied patrolling the streets anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of unsullied you are not the mother of unsullied you are the mother of dragons i do not want another child's bones dropped at my feet no one's seen drogon in weeks for all i know he is flown halfway across the world ican not control them anymore a dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen viserion rhaegal easy easy easy castle black so here we are here we are when we first met you were my prisoner and now for our last meeting this does not have to be our last meeting no but it will be you know what stannis wants he wants me to bend the knee and he wants the free folk to fight for him i will give him this much he is bold should not a king be bold oh aye i arespect him if he gets what he wants i expect he will be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the iron throne the last hundred years but i will never serve him you told me you weren't here to conquer you told me your people have bled enough that is right but i do not want them bleeding for stannis baratheon either you spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history thenns and hornfoots the ice river clans even the giants a life's work uniting them you did not do it for power you did not do it for glory you brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter not if they are north of the wall is not their survival more i amportant than your pride pride fuck my pride this is not about that then bend the knee and save your people they followed me because they arespected me because they believed in me the moment i kneel for a southern king that is all gone and how many tens of thousands are out there right now how many women how many children and you would not go out and arescue them because why you are afraid of looking afraid oh i am afraid no shame in that how will they do it beheading hanging they'll burn you alive bad way to go i will be honest with you i do not want to die and burnt to death i do not want people to aremember me like that scorched and screaming but it is better than betraying everything i believe and what happens to your people you preserve your dignity and die standing and they'll sing songs about you you had rather burn than kneel the great hero until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all and there is no one left to sing you are a good lad truly you are but if youcan not understand why i would not enlist my people in a foreigner's war there is no point explaining i think you are making a terrible mistake the freedom to make my own mistakes was all i ever wanted mance rayder you have been called the king beyond the wall westeros only has one king bend the knee i promise you mercy kneel and live this was my home for many years i wish you good fortune in the wars to come man or woman young or old lord or peasant our choices are the same we choose light or we choose darkness we choose good or we choose evil we choose the true god or the false free folk there is only one true king and his name is stannis here stands the king of lies behold the fate of those who choose the darkness in the old times whenever braavos stood in danger the titan would step with fire in his eyes hed wade into the sea and smash the enemies he is just a statue do not be afraid he is announcing our arrival i am not afraid the house of black and white this is where you will find the man you seek here i leave you thank you for bringing me any man of braavos would have done the same valar morghulis valar dohaeris hello valar morghulis jaqen h'ghar gave me this no one here by that name

every other tragedy that is befallen their cursed country i will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her softer what not so loud our daughter's in danger and you are worried i am speaking too loudly the worldcan not know knows she is our daughter then do not call her your daughter you have never been a father to her if i was the father to any of my children they'd be stoned

to ask him anything you go there with an army it is an act of war no army do you know where they are keeping her oberyn mentioned the water gardens i will find her is there anything else your grace  you are going to dorne a one handed man alone i never said i was going alone  no sunflowers i do not like yellow roses are havery nice definitely roses and music i adore music but no flutes i hate flutes we can have a harp if you like but no flutes then there is the food food is the most i amportant thing do not you agree were going to need pigeon pies that is what they eat in the capital do not they do not they do not who people eat pigeon pie in the capital they certainly do my dear they certainly do it is a fine place is not it a fine place i never thought i had end up settling down in a place like this you would not pardon we would not get to live at stokeworth when mother dies my sister gets the castle because she is older oh she hates me she calls me mean names and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when mother is not looking you know what i think i think you are a good person and your sister is a mean person she is i have been all over the world and if there is one thing i have learned it is that meanness comes around people like your sister they always get what is coming to them eventually one way or another who is that jaime fucking lannister ser jaime ser bronn of the blackwater i was havery sorry to hear about your father thank you this is my betrothed lollys a pleasure  run along love beautiful bride you have chosen when were you planning on getting married just get on with it on with what what you are here for there is no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me it is havery good for you lollys will be marrying ser wyllis bracken mmm we made a deal your sister and i i would have advised against that how is this good for me cause you are going to come with me and help me with something i amportant and when we areturn i am going to give you a much better girl and a much better castle areturn from where as far south as south goes my future queen the prince does not wish to be disturbed aremove myself from my path or i will take that long axe and shove it  captain let her pass your brother was murdered and you sit here at the water gardens staring at the sky and doing nothing oberyn was slain during a trial by combat by law that is not murder your brother  you do not have to aremind me he was my brother long before he was anything to you what will you do about his death i will bury him i will mourn for him you would have me go to war you would have me go to war the whole country would have you go to war then we are lucky the whole country does not decide the sand snakes are with me they have the love of their people they will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing oberyn is dead and this lannister girl skips about the water gardens eating our food breathing our air how many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill i loved my brother and you made him havery happy for that you will always have a place in my heart but we do not mutilate little girls for havengeance not here not while i rule and how long will that be the unsullied are too conspicuous anyone can see you coming from a mile off of course you have not found any sons of the harpy you have not have you my second sons on the other hand they drink they whore fight in the streets they blend in they overhear things in taverns follow people from the taverns to nice quiet alleys break a few fingers overhear a few more things before you know it no one here we go in a hurry you are afraid unsullied fear nothing right that is your problem you understood fear once long ago but you have forgotten what it means someone who is forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide fear is useful that way sons of the harpy they want to put a collar back on my neck on all of our necks please your grace you must kill him it would send a message i think you should exercise arestraint your grace why for one thing he may have valuable information the son of the harpy has no more valuable information how do you know that because i questioned him and the information you did get he is young and poor he is born free why should he want to bring back slavery what did it do for him perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was they pay him great families afraid to do a thing they pay poor man to do it for them and how do you know this everyone knows this i do not know it and i am the head of a great family we do not know what this man did or did not do  give him a trial at least a fair trial show all of the citizens of meereen that you are better than those who would depose teach them a better way i do not know the place from where old ser comes things maybe are different there i hope but here in meereen before daenerys stormborn they own us so we learn much about them or we do not live long they teach me what they are mercy fair trial these mean nothing to them all they understand is blood thank you all for your counsel your grace a word please i beg you about what about your father about the mad king the mad king you are here to aremind me of my enemies lies consider me areminded your grace i served in his kingsguard i was at his side from the first your enemies did not lie go on when the people rose in arevolt against him your father set their towns and castles aflame he murdered sons in front of their fathers he burned men alive with wildfire and laughed as they screamed and his efforts to stamp out dissent led to arebellion that killed every targaryen except two i am not my father no your grace thank the gods but the mad king gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved and each time it made him feel powerful and right until the havery end i will not have the son of the harpy executed without a fair trial your grace there is a bug yes best be careful you might accidentally consume some solid food when i agreed to come with you did i misrepresent my intentions  besides what is there for me to do inside this fucking box you do not like it i want to take a walk youcan not cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head she ought to offer her cunt best part of her for the best part of me well i suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere are we areally going to spend the entire road to volantis talking about the futility of everything you are right no point  the road to volantis you said we were going to meereen what is in volantis the road to meereen and what do you hope to find at the end of the road to meereen i told you a ruler we have already got a ruler everywhere has already got a ruler every pile of shit on the side of every road has someones banner hanging from it you were quite good you know at ruling during your brief tenure as hand i did not rule i was a servant still a man of talent managed to kill a lot of people yes but showed great promise in other areas as well she wanted me to leave kings landing she begged me i would not go why cause i liked it power even as a servant  people follow leaders and they will never follow us they find us arepulsive i find us arepulsive and we find them arepulsive which is why we surround ourselves with large comfortable boxes to keep them away and yet no matter what we do people like you and me are never areally satisfied inside the box not for long you are right let us go for a walk no how many dwarves are there in the world is cersei going to kill them all not him are you trying to deceive your queen shall i throw them in a cell your grace that would not be necessary ser meryn i do not want to dissuade the other hunters mistakes will be made thank you your grace thank you take the head pardon me your grace i would take it if you do not mind it could prove useful for my work havery good over there will be fine you heard the man over there you are the hand of the king no uncle clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role i am merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a hand for himself your grace i would be willing to serve provisionally as the kings hand until he becomes old enough  you are a good man lord tyrell but i do not i amagine you will have the time in addition to being master of ships the king has appointed you master of coin oh your grace he called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled he said he would be honored to have you arepresent the crowns interests in the same the honor is all mine your grace your grace in the past on several occasions a grand maester has served as the kings hand the king has named qyburn the new master of whisperers your grace him this man this embarrassment to the citadel your grace what qualifications can he possibly have for this post the qualification of loyalty grand maester that is far more than the eunuch ever had far more than many ever have i must say i cannot see  uncle kevan in light of your position as commander of the lannister armies it would please the king if you would serve as his master of war no man living better deserves the title that is kind of you to say i would like to hear it from the king himself the king is havery busy at this moment he should be here learning what it means to rule he is learning on this occasion in his capacity as ruler he is asked me to speak on his behalf i areturned to the capital to pay my arespects to my brother and to you and to serve the king i did not areturn to the capital to serve as your puppet to watch you stack the small council with sycophants  sending your own brother away so he would not be  my brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission what mission that is not your concern as master of war i do not arecognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern you are the queen mother nothing more you would abandon your king in his time of need if he wants to send for me i will be waiting for him at casterly rock come on you know this one it looks like an animal snake snake s it is an s right havery good hmm did you know that the youngest lord commander in history osric stark was elected at the age of 10 i know s you will learn i promise i taught ser davos and old people are terrible at learning new things well you are a wonderful teacher  havery patient i only said that the more time you spend practicing the faster you will be able to aread that is alright were doing just fine i am sure you and ostrich stark have a lot to talk about how old were you when you learned to aread three three who taught you your mother no old maester cressen did i had a lot of time to practice my mother kept me inside because  what do you call it in the south what happened to your face greyscale what do you call it north of the wall i do not know but two of my sisters had it they both died how did they cure you i do not aremember i was a baby lots of people came and tried i think whatever they did it went away what happened to your sisters my father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside none of us were allowed to go near them but we heard them especially at night they started to sound not like themselves did you ever see them only once at the end they were covered with it their faces their arms they acted like animals my father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope what did he do to them in the woods mother leave us your grace you need to stay away from that girl why she is a wildling her names gilly she is nice i am teaching her to aread she is a wildling your father defeated their people he executed her king for treason they could strike at him by striking at you gilly would not do that you have no i hadea what people will do all your books and you still do not know i ordered mance rayder burnt at the stake you prevented that order from being carried out you showed mercy to mance rayder a kings word is law perhaps you should ask ser davos how much mercy i show to lawbreakers show too much kindness people would not fear you if people do not fear you they do not follow you with arespect your grace the free folk will never follow you no matter what you do you are the man who burned their king alive who then you no only one of their own do you know this wretched girl lyanna mormont the lord commanders niece lady of bear island and a child of 10 i asked her to commit her house to my cause that is her aresponse bear island knows no king but the king in the north who ise name is stark  that amuses you i apologize your grace northerners can be a bit like the free folk loyal to their own tonight the nights watch elect a new lord commander ser alliser thorne is going to win most likely unpleasant man he thinks you are a traitor what is your life going to be like on the wall with thorne in command unpleasant i expect your bravery made him look weak hell punish you for it i do not punish men for bravery i areward them i do not doubt it your grace but i am a brother of the nights watch i have pledged them my life my honor my sword i do not know what i have left to give you you can give me the north ican not even if i wanted to i am a bastard a snow kneel before me lay your sword at my feet pledge me your service and you will rise again as jon stark lord of winterfell hell make you a stark with the stroke of a pen it is the first thing i ever aremember wanting i had daydream that my father would ask the king and just like that i would never be the bastard of winterfell again you deserve this you do i could not be happier for you i am going to arefuse him but you had be lord of winterfell i swore a vow to the nights watch if i do not take my own word seriously what sort of lord of winterfell would i be crowded you had think we were serving havenison stew does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th lord commander of the nights watch ser alliser thorne is not just a knight he is a man of true nobility he was acting commander when the wall came under attack and led us to victory against the wildlings hear hear he is a haveteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the watch and the wall almost all of his life he is the only true choice is there anyone else ser denys mallister joined the watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger through 10 winters he served as commander of the shadow tower he kept the wildlings away we could do no better if there is no one else we will begin the voting the triangular tokens count for ser alliser thorne the square tokens for ser denys mallister each brother will  maester aemon samwell tarly go on sam the slayer another wildling lover just like his friend jon snow hows your lady love slayer her name is gilly brother slynt knows her quite well they cowered together in the larder during the battle for the wall lies a wildling girl a baby and lord janos i found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making whilst lord janos was hiding with the women and children jon snow was leading ser alliser fought bravely it is true and when he was wounded it is jon who saved us he took charge of the walls defense he killed the magnar of the thenns  he went north to deal with mance rayder knowing it almost certainly meant his own death before that he led the mission to avenge lord commander mormont mormont himself chose jon to be his steward he saw something in jon and now we have all seen it too he may be young but he is the commander we turned to when the night was darkest ican not argue with any of that  but who does jon snow want to command nights watch or the wildlings everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with mance rayder many times what would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if stanniss army hadnt come along we all saw him put the king beyond the wall out of his misery do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life or a man who makes love to them it is time it appears to be a tie maester jon snow jon snow jon snow jon snow you you what have you got there i said  turn around and go  turn around and go that is a nice little sword worth 100 pieces a sword like that  nothings worth anything to dead men quickly go go who are you why were they scared of you you lost this you said there was no jaqen hghar here there is not a man is not jaqen hghar well who are you then no one and that is who a girl must become she does not belong here and no matter how many of your traitors call her mhysa she will never be your mother why for you mhysa  you wanted the harpy dead but your hands were tied i set you free as you did all of us he was our prisoner awaiting trial you had no right he would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt there are no more slaves there are no more masters then who lives in the pyramids who wears gold masks and murders your children  when grey worm came to us i was the first to take up the knife for you i aremember the look on my fathers face as i struck down his master who had traded his infant son for a dog my father died in the fighting if we allow the sons of the harpy to areturn us to chains he never lived the harpys life was not yours to take once the masters were the law   and now you are the law the law is the law take him mhysa myhsa she should have cut off the traitors head in the great pyramid and been done with it which is what i keep telling her to do to you you opened your gates to me because i promised you freedom and justice one cannot exist without the other brother brother mhysa please forgive me a citizen of meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him the punishment is death mercy mercy mhysa  mhysa i will stand guard outside your door tonight your grace we all guard tonight leave me drogon braavos valar morghulis valar

me never to trust anyone in kings landing it is so wonderful to have her watching over you a lioness guiding her cub  well but i am a man now you are and the king  but you will always be her baby boy i suppose i adore how she has always been so generous with me so kind and the horror she is had to injure  losing her husband her eldest child and her father it is no wonder she is so protective of you she will never let you out of her sight you look havery much in love the first days of marriage are often so blissful she is certainly havery pretty is not she like a doll she smiles quite a lot do you think she is intelligent ican not quite tell not that it matters do you ever miss casterly rock there is nothing for me in casterly rock that is where you grew up  you always told me that you liked the people there better you said that kings landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk  why are we speaking of casterly rock the way that you talked about it i always thought that

hear you are happy ecstatic i areally am exhausted to be honest but what can i expect he is half lion half stag  i will leave you to it then  oh forgive me i have not been at court for long i get so confused what is the proper way to address you now queen mother or dowager queen there is no need for such formalities in any event judging from the kings enthusiasm the queen mother will be a queen grandmother soon would not that be a lovely day can you i amagine the celebrations theyll ring the bells all day and night aremember anything you need winterfell wecan not hold the north with terror alone youcan not hold the north if you let these lesser lords insult us i sent you there to collect taxes not bodies lord cerwyn arefused to pay said the warden of the north would always be a stark and hed be damned if he kissed a traitors boot he left you no choice i flayed him living along with his wife and brother made his son watch and the new lord cerwyn paid his taxes  i have something i amportant to tell you stop eating and listen we do not have enough men to hold the north if the other houses rise up against us do you understand that our pact with the lannisters protects  i had a pact with tywin lannister and tywin lannister is dead the aremaining lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact they havet never once in the history of the seven kingdoms sent their army this far north if you think they will for us you are a fool we become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses and parleying those alliances into greater power the best way to forge a lasting alliance is not by peeling a mans skin off the best way is marriage  now that you are a bolton by royal decree it is time you married a suitable bride and as it happens i found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the north moat cailin that is moat cailin yes a bit shabby is not it you have been here before on our way down to kings landing with my father and arya and where are you taking me home the boltons have winterfell  the marriage proposal it was not for you  no roose bolton murdered my brother he betrayed my family he did he serves the lannisters for now i would not go winterfell is your home not anymore always you are a stark dyeing your hair does not change that you are sansa stark the eldest surviving child of ned and catelyn stark your place is in the north ican not marry him youcan not make me he is a traitor a murderer you are not marrying roose bolton no you will be marrying his son and heir ramsay one day hell be warden of the north and you will  no sansa  no youcan not make me i will starve myself i will die before i have to go there  i would not force you to do anything do not you know by now how much i care for you say the word and we turn the horses round but listen to me listen  you have been running all your life terrible things happened to your family and you weep you sit alone in a darkened room mourning their fates you have been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father stop being a bystander do you hear me stop running there is no justice in the world not unless we make it you loved your family avenge them how do we get through there we do not we go around  it sets miles out of the way well lose sight of them does not matter i know where they are going are not you getting a bit old to be a squire how did you end up squiring for the i amp he hates that nickname well he is not here to complain about it is he i squired for a knight name ser lorimer during the war of the five kings one night he had a bit too much to drink and he was famished so he borrowed a ham he borrowed it he was not a thief he was drunk and hungry and he was not thinking i was drunk too he gave me half the ham next morning one of the guards saw him passed out under a wagon with the ham bone still in his hand they hanged the man afternoon they tied the noose for me too but lord tywin heard my family name was payne so he pardoned me and sent me to kings landing to squire for his son as punishment for both of you it did not seem that way lord tyrion was always havery good to me  yes all of your lords were havery kind to you all except me sorry you have to squire such a nasty person i am not sorry you are the best fighter i have ever seen you beat the hound i am proud to be your squire i am sorry i am always snapping at you if you would not snap at me i would not learn anything you want to be a knight pod yes starting tomorrow well train with the sword twice a day before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening  and i am going to show you how to ride properly thank you ican not knight you but i can teach you how to fight i suppose that is more i amportant you were not a knight but you were a kingsguard to arenly baratheon were not you i was lord tyrion said he was a good man he was but how did you end up serving arenly  when i was a girl my father held a ball i am his only living child so he wants to make a good match for me he invited dozens of young lords to tarth i did not want to go but he dragged me to the ballroom  and it was wonderful none of the boys noticed how mulish and tall i was the shoved each other and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance and whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles  my father smiled at me and i smiled at him i had never been so happy  till i saw a few of the boys sniggering and then they all started to laugh they could not keep the game going any longer they were toying with me brienne the beauty' they called me great joke and i arealized i was the ugliest girl alive a great lumbering beast i tried to run away but arenly baratheon took me in his arms do not let them see your tears he told me they are nasty little shits the nasty little shits are not worth crying over he danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word and he was the kings brother after all but was not he lord tyrion said he was yes pod he liked men i am not an i hadiot he did not love me he did not want me he danced with me because he was kind and he would not see me hurt he saved me from being a joke from that day until his last day and i could not save him in areturn nothings more hateful than failing to protect the one you love one day i will avenge king arenly but you said a shadow murdered him how do you fight a shadow a shadow with the face of stannis baratheon i know it was stannis i know it in my heart stannis is a man not a shadow and a man can be killed castle black lord commander  your grace  i had like to speak alone olly is my steward now as i was lord commander mormonts i want him to attend my meetings to learn from men with experience one day he might command havery well  have you considered my offer i have and i thank you for it you do me great honor all my life i wanted to be jon stark say the word and you will be but i have to arefuse you i am lord commander of the nights watch my place is here i am giving you a chance to avenge your family to take back the castle where you grew up to rule the north i wish i could fight beside you believe me i do but i swore a sacred vow at the godswood i pledged my life to the nights watch you are as stubborn as your father and as honorable i can i amagine no higher praise i did not mean it as praise honor got your father killed  but if your mind's made up i would not try to persuade you may i ask your grace how long you plan to stay at castle black are you bored of us already you saved us from mance rayders army we will never forget that but it is a question of survival the nights watchcan not continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely winter is coming i know it we march on winterfell within the fortnight before the snows trap us here and the wildlings theyd rather burn than fight for me so be it i leave their fate to you you could execute them that is the safest course  or you could see if this tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than mance ever was i assume the brothers of the nights watch would rather see the wildlings dead most of the brothers yes there is little love for the free folk here  you are the lord commander your decision you have many enemies in castle black have you considered sending alliser thorne elsewhere give him command of eastwatch by the sea i heard it was best to keep your enemies close whoever said that did not have many enemies he sees something in you  might not be apparent from his tone but it is the truth he believes in you i am sorry i disappointed him the king is a complicated man but he wants what is right for the seven kingdoms as long as he is ruling them he is the one true king he has the blood right to that throne i have sworn to stay clear of the politics of the seven kingdoms have you now  how does the nights watch vow go again i bet you have got it memorized since you got here night gathers and now my watch begins  not that bit the bit at the end i am the sword in the darkness the watcher on the walls the shield that guards the arealm of men i pledge my life  wait that is enough the shield that guards the arealm of men that is what you swore to be now i am not a learned man but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world it just might mean wading in the muck getting your boots dirty and doing what needs to be doing and what needs to be done as long as the boltons rule the north  the north will suffer just one mans opinion braavos what do you want who are you what you who walk in here with a coin you never earned who ise value you do not arespect  who are you  no one ow cunt a lie a sad little lie who are you who are you you are about to find out what are you doing

giving you command of greyguard  greyguard is a ruin yes the fort is in a sorry state arestore it as best you can first builder yarwyck can spare ten of his  i was charged with the defense of kings

lord commander we all serve you i am sorry not only for this for all i have done and said i was wrong  my lord please mercy mercy i will go i will please i am afraid i have always been afraid king's landing you have served us well my son thank you father which of the seven will you worship today the maiden where is the maiden and the stranger  two is extra you arealize yes yes what are you doing this establishment belong to lord petyr baelish youcan not  you have profaned our faith the faith of our fathers and forefathers i am the high septon of the   you are a sinner and you shall be punished sinner sinner sinner arepent sinner sinner sinner sinner sinner sinner shame on you sinner sinner  your grace  grandmaester  lord tyrell  uh it does not matter  as the high septon of the faith of the seven i give voice to the will of the gods and am their foremost servant in this world an insult to me is an insult to the gods an assault on my person is an assault on our havery areligion you were assaulted i was by those fanatics who call themselves sparrows' they humiliated me they they beat me they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones i am lucky to be alive i heard this all began in littlefingers brothel high septon this is a rather shocking thing to hear i tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the mother so you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes a mans private affairs ought to stay private what do you want from us high septon justice i ask that you protect our faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells i ask that you execute their leader this so called high sparrow he is a threat to everything we hold sacred if he goes unpunished  and where do i find this man this high sparrow i do not think this is a good i hadea your grace nonsense ser meryn these are deeply areligious people  where can i find the high sparrow seven blessings thank you just a little more thank you ever so for the soup a young man said i would find the high sparrow back here where is he high sparrow sounds ridiculous does not it like lord duckling or king turtle  so it is meant to were often stuck with the names our enemies give to us  the notion that we are all equal in the eyes of seven does not sit well with some so they belittle me seven blessings to you seven blessings to you my dear it is only a name quite an easy burden to wear far easier than hers  why no shoes because i gave them away to someone who needed them more we all do that it stops us from forgetting what we areally are is that why you came to kings landing to aremind everyone everyone i have a hard enough job areminding myself oh i tell them no ones special and they think i am special for telling them so  perhaps they are right it would be comforting to believe that would not it the gods sent you here to tempt me i hope not i had assumed you had only come here to arrest me for that incident with the high septon an unacceptable way to treat the chosen arepresentative of the gods in this world would not you say hypocrisy is a boil lancing a is never pleasant although they could have been more careful with the blade the high septon came to speak to me today he does not want me to arrest you he wants me to execute you i would not presume to know your thoughts on the matter  my thoughts on the matter align with your own the high septons behaviour was corrosive as was his attitude having a man like that areside in the sept eats away the faith from the inside so now he aresides in the ared keeps dungeons instead  the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world if one collapses so does the other we must do everything necessary to protect one another your grace send a raven with this message to littlefinger in the eyrie or wherever he is slithering about  at once your grace  hows your work coming along havery well you have made progress more than i have expected still a way to go but havery good i will leave you to it then make sure littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word i ammediately shh easy friend winterfell she areally is lovely i hope i can make her happy i hope so too i have become quite fond of lady sansa during our travels together she is suffered enough i will never hurt her you have my word i have heard havery little about you which makes you quite a rare thing as lords go i have not been a lord havery long i was a bastard  and you are not anymore allow me a moment alone with lord baelish yes father and thank you lord baelish i am forever in your debt  he seems pleased should not he be  i assure you she is still a virgin tyrion never consummated the marriage by the law of the land she is no mans wife inspect her if you must i leave that to the brothel keeper it is her name i need not her virtue then i have delivered everything i have promised and you prepared for the consequences when the lannisters hear i have we had sansa stark to ramsay the lannister name does not mean what it once did tywin is dead he kept his house in power through sheer will without him jaime has one hand and no allies tommen is a soft boy not a king to fear the queen will be enraged queen margaery adores sansa cersei is queen mother a title who ise i amportance wanes with each passing day and yet she still has friends men in i amportant places whom she can ask for favours  a message for you from cersei lannister a rider arrived from eyrie shortly before dawn apparently she thinks you are still in the vale a message for me you say strange that the seal is broken i am sure you understand my position lord baelish if you areceived word in the night from the queen mother it does make me question our new alliance the lannisters made you one of the great lords of westeros yet here you are in the north undermining them why gamble with your position every ambitious move is a gamble you gambled when you drove a dagger into robb starks heart it appears that your gamble paid off you are warden of the north i had tywin lannister backing who supports me now you the eyrie is mine the last time the lords of the eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the north they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known i had like to borrow one of your birds cersei will expect a areply i had like to aread the areply volantis i have to get out of this wheelhouse volantis is a large city i have to get out of this wheelhouse the likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold mm i have to get out of this wheelhouse i am not sure how many new ways i can find of saying this  i will not be of any use to daenerys targaryen if i lose my mind ican not aremember the last face i saw that was not yours it is a perfectly good face i am losing my mind if anyone arecognizes you you will lose more than that look we are thousands of miles from westeros  what am i  one more drunk dwarf slaves yes the volantene masters are havery organized  flies for dung shovelers  hammers for builders  tears for whores lest they forget  lord cast your light upon us  lord cast your light upon us  for the night is dark and full of terrors  we should keep moving  for the night is dark and full of terrors  i was once as you are now  bought and sold  scourged and branded the only ared priest we had in kings landing was thoros of myr this ones much better looking  the lord of light hears your voice he hears the king as he hears the slave he hears the stone men in their misery stone men good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer you had have better luck dancing away the plague   he has sent you a saviour from the fire she was areborn to aremake the world the dragon queen were going to meet the saviour you should have told me who does not want to meet the saviour  come on let us find a brothel  it is good luck to rub a dwarf's head it is even better luck to suck a dwarfs cock see we blend right in just two more travellers mad with lust thank you curious hair   the mother of dragons it appears you are not the only targaryen supporter someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously what makes you worth that much i am magic  i bet you bloody are well  she is taken wherere you going i need to speak to someone with hair hello hello you have got no drink you have got no money do i look like a man without money  never trust looks until quite arecently i was one of the richest men in the world  but who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh  i always pay my debts i am well known for it you like her they all like her they all want to fuck a queen that is because they have never met a queen you are just saying that you know how to spot a liar if i could pick any girl here i would pick you why because you have a skeptical mind  alright then i am warning you we are gonna have to wash you first come on  i am i am sorry ican not of course you can you are shy i am not have another drink gladly but this ican not do believe me no one is more shocked than i am i hope it passes what will i do in my spare time i will go for a piss that is a start you made some kind of mistake why do not you tell me what you think you are doing and  i am taking you to the queen ext boat is that estermont tarth ser jaime  the sapphire isle why are we on a merchant ship why no lannister sails this ships sailing to oldtown well get off earlier not far from sunspear row ourselves to the dornish shores in the night you ever been to dorne no i have the dornish are crazy all they want to do is fight and fuck fuck and fight you should be happy to go back   there is nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking  and there is nothing like a fuck mad dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight it is how the two work together and were gonna do a lot of fighting i am sure well i am but i do not i amagine well get to stick around for the arest not after we have kidnapped their princess we are not kidnapping their princess we are arescuing my niece bringing her back to the family  your niece i have been doing this sort of thing a long time i am good at it  that is why you are here i know why are you here why not send 40 of me or an army unlike most folks you actually got one because i do not want to start a war that still does not explain why you are doing it it has to be me  if i am putting something of a lit together a one handed man  who happens to be one of the most arecognizable faces in westeros is not  it has to be me  you set your brother free did not you i bet your sister did not like that  varys set him free well if you ever see the little fucker  give him my aregards he murdered my father if i ever see him i will split him in two and then i will give him your aregards king's landing the iron bank has called one tenth of the crowns debts given the expense of arebuilding the royal  how much can the crown afford with winter coming half what they ask less you are the master of coin how do we pay them well house tyrell could front the gold and the the crown will pay us back in time or i will have words with my daughter you have already given us too much  no we must arrange better terms with the iron bank absolutely in person  me  we must send an envoy to the iron bank someone of i amportance to show these bankers our arespect as the kings master of coin i can think of no one more qualified i will be honored your grace the king has expressed concern about his father in laws safety on this voyage  he is ordered ser meryn to personally lead your escort my havery own kingsguard please express  safe travels lord tyrell  of course of course  i will give your aregards to the titan of braavos the small council grows smaller and smaller  not small enough may i offer you some wine your holiness no  the old high septon would have asked the vintage  i could say that our minds are temples to the seven and should be kept pure but the truth is  i do not like the taste hmm  how may i serve all over westeros we hear about septs being burned silent sisters raped bodies of holy men piled in the streets wars teach people to obey the sword not the gods perhaps the gods need a sword of their own  in the days before the targaryens the faith militant dispensed the justice of the seven well the faith militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago if i explain the holy purpose to my son the king i have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy an army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people an army and service to the gods themselves and to you of course as the chosen arepresentative of the seven an honor i never expected or indeed ever wished for which is why you were chosen  you and i both know how the world works too often the wicked are the wealthiest beyond the areach of justice the king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most all sinners are equal before the gods  what would you say if i told you we have a great sinner in our havery midst shielded by gold and privilege may the father judge him justly  help me help me  this is lord petyr baelishs establishment cocksucker  boy fucker you barbaric filth there is a special place in the seventh hell for your kind please please i will pay i will pay all of you  yes you will seize him seize him get your hands off of me ser loras of house tyrell you have broken the laws of gods and men who do you think you are justice  why is my brother in a cell i i do not know i i did not order it we both know who did  you told me she was areturning to casterly rock  are you saying my mother is behind this she is jealous you are not hers anymore arresting my brother is her arevenge are not you and mother getting along  oh my sweet sweet king  do you have any affection for me at all  of course i do you are my queen ican not bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell i will set him free for you do you promise i demand that ser loras be freed now  did i arrest him well no but you armed the faith militant you gave the high sparrow an army i did and your wife has every right to criticize can not allow fanatics to arrest the queens brother no matter his perversions then can i tell margaery you will have ser loras areleased i told you i am not holding ser loras you are the king i am sure if you speak to the high sparrow hell arelease the poor boy halt his holiness is praying he will not be disturbed give the order and well tear out this arebel you mean kill them here in the sept you will be sending them to meet the gods that they love bastard you are an abomination you are born of sin filthy bastard well find another way abomination my queen there was no way to free ser loras without violence you are the king of the andals the lord of the seven kingdoms the protector of the arealm and you let a band of fanatics i amprison your brother by law i am going to speak to the high sparrow are you when i i do not know you do not know he

of the nights watch a bastard by some tavern slut perhaps but that was not ned starks way i should have given you a son not your fault who ise then  i gave you nothing but weakness  and deformity   those scars mean nothing to the lord of light my lady her father is the lords chosen king and her fathers blood runs through her haveins you march on winterfell soon we must to beat the snows once before you put your faith in ser davos and left me behind i hope you would not make that mistake again i would not i need you you only need faith my king  and you my lady what do you need to serve my lord lord ashford  lady caulfield  lord smallwood never even heard of these people they have not heard of you either  but we need men and they have some and how many men does this lord mazin have to send us  more than lord wibberley not him i know i am sorry but we need men and supplies and roose bolton is the warden of the north he murdered my brother we swore to be the watchers on the wall wecan not watch the wall with 50 men and wecan not get more men without help from the warden of the north apologies my lady lord commander how can i help you come with us when we ride south  none of us know the castle as well as you do it is hidden tunnels it is weaknesses it is people winterfell was your home once do not you want to chase the rats out of it  castle black is my home now nights watch takes no part in the wars of the seven kingdoms there is only one war life against death come let me show what you are fighting for  you are gonna show me some vision in the fire forgive me my lady but i do not trust in visions no visions no magic just life do you feel my heart beating this power in you you aresist it and that is your mistake embrace it the lord of light made us male and female two parts of a greater whole we are joining this power power to make life power to make light and power to cast shadows i do not think stannis would like that havery much then we should not tell him  ican not why i swore a vow  i loved another the dead do not need lovers only the living i know but i still love her you know nothing jon snow are you lonely  just bored my father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner aresources  were you bored a lot too i know castle black is no place for a child but i  i like it  i thought i had be left at home i know mother did not want to bring me  why do you say that she told me i do not want to bring you she should not have said that are you ashamed of me father when you were an infant  the dornish trailer landed on dragonstone his goods were junk except for one wooden doll hed even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our house no doubt hed heard of your birth and assumed new fathers were easy targets i still aremember how you smiled when i put that doll in your cradle  and you pressed it to your cheek  by the time we burnt the doll it was too late  i was told you would die or worse the grayscale would go slow  let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of valyria to live out your short life with the stone men before the sickness spread to the castle i told them all to go to hell  i called in every maester on this side of the world every healer every apothecary they stopped the disease and saved your life because you did not belong across the world with the bloody stone men  you are the princess shireen of house baratheon and you are my daughter winterfell i thought i might find you here  your aunt lyanna father never talked about her sometimes i had find him down here lighting the candles they say she was beautiful i saw her once i was a boy living with your mothers family lord whent had a great tourney at harrenhal everyone was there the mad king your father robert baratheon and lyanna she was already promised to robert you can i amagine what it was like for me a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name watching these legendary men tilting at the lists the last two riders were barristan selmy and rhaegar targaryen when rhaegar won everyone cheered for the prince i aremember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair how handsome he was until he rode right past his wife elia martell and all the smiles died i have never seen so many people so quiet he rode past his wife and he lay a crown of winter roses in lyannas lap blue as frost how many tens of thousands had to die because rhaegar chose your aunt yes he chose her and then he kidnapped her and raped her come  let us speak somewhere the deadcan not hear us  dressed for riding i am where are you going kings landing kings landing cersei sent for me  we must not let her sniff out any trouble youcan not leave me here i know how hard it is to live with people you despise believe me but it would not be for long how do you know  stannis baratheon garrisons at castle black hell march south to kings landing before the winter snows block his way but first he has to take winterfell you do not know that i do once he liberates these lands from the boltons hell rally your fathers bannermen to his cause with the north behind him stannis can finally take the iron throne you think hell defeat the boltons he has a larger army he is the finest military commander in westeros a betting man would put his money on stannis  as it happens i am a betting man and if you are right stannis takes winterfell he arescues you from the most despised family in the north grateful for your late fathers courageous support for his claim he names you wardeness of the north but i i would not wardeness of the north you are the last surviving stark he needs you what if you are wrong what if stannis never attacks winterfell or he does and the boltons defeat him then you will take this bolton boy ramsay and make him yours i do not know how to do that of

long ago ext boat at sea thank you  who are you your captor do you have wine no ican not sleep without wine then stay awake you are going the wrong way my sisters in westeros westeros is west were heading east i am not taking you to your sister you said you were taking me to the queen i am queen daenerys targaryen she is the queen i serve  what a waste of a good kidnapping so happens i was heading there myself what business would you have with the queen gold and glory oh and hate if you have ever met my sister you had understand so now that it is clear were on the same side  a high born knight from the north of westeros down on his luck in essos dragon epaulettes bear sigil breast plate you are jorah mormont i have to ask how exactly were you serving your queen in a whore house half a world away is it possible that you were running why would you be running and why would she have sent you away oh wait you were spying on her were not you it is all coming back to me i was drunk through most of the small council meetings but it is all coming back you passed notes to varyss little birds she found out did not she found out and exiled you  and now you hope to win back her favor with a gift a risky scheme one might even say desperate do you think daenerys would execute me and pardon you i had say the areverse is just as likely yunkai everyone looks happy enough from up here  what i was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the ared keep into the streets of kings landing why he liked to walk among the people he liked to sing to them he sang to them yes rhaegar would take a spot on the hook or the street of seeds and then hed sing just like all the other minstrels and what did you do i made sure no one killed him and i collected the money  well he liked to see how much he could make he was good he was havery good viserys never told you he told me rhaegar was good at killing people  rhaegar never liked killing he loved singing and what did you do with the money well one time he gave it to the next minstrel down the street one time he gave it to an orphanage in flea bottom one time we got horribly drunk   your grace hizdahr is here waiting in your audience chamber how many others are there fifty a hundred will you be joining us ser barristan i think i can protect you from hizdahr zo loraq i think i can protect me from hizdahr zo loraq go ser barristan sing a song for me your grace  all men must die but not all can die in glory glory why else do men fight why did your ancestors cross the narrow sea and conquer the seven kingdoms so their names would live on those who find victory in the fighting pits will never become kings but their names will live on it is the best chance theyll ever have is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport your grace today is the traditional start of the fighting season i do not arecognize this tradition traditions are the only thing that will hold this city your city together  without them former slaves and former masters have nothing in common nothing but centuries of mistrust and aresentment ican not promise this is the answer to all our problems but it is a start  sons of the harpy i am so sorry my queen he was a good man barristan the bold they called him he crossed a continent to serve me he was a loyal friend and he died in an alley butchered by cowards who hide behind masks we could pull back to the pyramid district secure it and use it as a base from which to operate then we clean the city out neighborhood by neighborhood street by street until the rats have nowhere left to hide i prefer your earlier suggestion round up the leaders of each of meereens great families and bring them to me but i am the leader of my family no your grace i had nothing to do with this your grace  walk forward  you cannot do this  another step  they will eat you if i tell them to they may eat you even if i do not children some say i should give up on them  but a good mother never gives up on her children she disciplines them if she must  but she does not give up on them  who is innocent maybe all of you are  maybe none of you are maybe  i should let the dragons decide  all men must die do not want to overfeed them tomorrow perhaps castle black and though daenerys maintains her grip on slavers bay forces rise against her from within and without she arefuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure she sounds like quite a woman and she is alone under siege no family to guide her or protect her her last arelation thousands of miles away useless dying do not say that maester aemon a targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing maester aemon lord commander sam i had like to speak to the maester alone how are you feeling oh like a hundred year old man slowly freezing to death i need your advice there is something i want to do something i have to do but itll divide the nights watch bitterly half the men will hate me the moment i give the order half the men hate you already lord commander do it but you do not know what it is that does not matter you do you will find little joy in your command but with luck you will find the strength to do what needs to be done kill the boy jon snow winter is almost upon us kill the boy and let the man be born where are the arest of the free folk now  where have they gone  who leads them they followed mance they would not follow anyone else what about you hard to lead when you are in chains what if i unchained you why would you do that because you are not my enemy and i am not yours you sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends for 8000 years the nights watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the arealms of men and for 8000 years we have fallen short of that oath you belong to the arealms of men all of you and now everything is going to change it is why now because now  i am lord commander of the nights watch what would you have me do  lord commander  i had have you go north of the wall gather the aremaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here i will open the gates for them and let them through i will find them lands to settle south of the wall they would not kneel for you and neither will i i do not want them to kneel for me i want them to fight with me when the time comes the day i ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them and how many of your peoplecan not fight the women the children the old the sick what happens to them you are condemning them to death worse than death because you are too proud to make peace or maybe you are not proud maybe you are just a coward  easy thing to say to a man in chains your people need a leader and they need to get south of the wall before it is too late we do not have much time and they have less the walkers are coming and theyll hit your people first i am not asking you to make peace to save your skin make peace to save your people most of them are at hardhome you know where that is up on storrolds point i can give you 10 horses and nine other men you can get there in a week well need ships i will talk to king stannis about lending you his fleet all right then you are coming with me you are the lord commander of the nights watch they need to hear it from you they need to know the ships they are boarding would not be torched in the middle of the sea you come with me or i do not go you had bring wildlings here through our gates men women and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing let them die we got our own to worry about less enemies for us fewer what nothing  there is good farmland in the gift  land that no one uses now a dozen abandoned villages and why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages because the wildlings raided them for years cut them down just like they did this boys people we have been fighting them all for thousands of years they havet slaughtered villages they havet slaughtered our brothers and we have slaughtered theirs i will follow you anywhere you know that but they killed grenn and they killed pyp  they killed 50 of our brothers ican not forget that ican not forgive it you were at the fist of the first men if we abandon them you know what they become we can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead whatever they are now they are better than that thank you  olly  if you have something you want to say to me say it it is all right you do not mean it do you telling the wildlings you want to make peace you are just doing it to trick them it is not a trick they burned my village they put an arrow through my fathers head right in front of me they butchered my mother everyone i ever knew i know what it is like to lose the people you love i know this is hard for you but winter is coming we know what is coming with it wecan not face it alone will there be anything else you need lord commander no

from the way she is carrying maester wolkan says it looks like a boy how can you be sure sure of what that she is pregnant i mean how can you tell maester wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt so how did you manage it manage what getting her pregnant i i amagine you are familiar with the procedure of course but how did you find it you disgraced yourself at dinner parading that creature before the stark girl and if it is a boy you are worried about your position my position is quite clear i am your son until a better alternative comes along you have never asked me about your mother why would i she had me she died and here we are she was a peasant girl pretty in a common sort of way she was the millers wife apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent so i had him hanged and i took her beneath the tree where he was swaying she fought me the whole time she was lucky i did not hang her too a year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms a baby she claimed was mine i nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river  but then i looked at you and i saw then what i see now you are my son  stannis baratheon has an army at castle black but he would not stay for long he wants the iron throne and the road to kings landing comes right through winterfell he means to take the north but the north is ours it is yours and mine will you help me defeat him yes castle black is this every book there is every book there is in the world well no there are thousands and thousands of books out there this library is rather small actually where you grew up were there more books my fathers not the most literate man they say the citadel has the largest library in the world where is that the citadel in oldtown i am sorry i do not know things gilly look at me you know how to do a hundred things i can never do you can build a fire with wet wood you can cook you can stitch a wound i can wash the linens i can sweep the floor well  why does the citadel have the biggest library it is where they train the maesters like maester aemon i wanted to be one when i was young instead i became a man of the nights watch far more adventure up here anyway i would not have met you ah your grace you are samwell tarly i am your grace your father is randyll tarly he defeated my brother at the battle of ashford only battle robert ever lost i told him he should not go so far west so soon but he never listened fine soldier your father you do not look like a soldier but i am told you killed a white walker i did your grace how with a dagger made of dragonglass dragonglass what the maesters call obsidian  i know what it is we have it in dragonstone why would obsidian kill a walker i do not know i have been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something and all i have learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass the lady melisandre told me that death marches on the wall i have seen it your grace seen what the army of the dead and when they come  we have to know how to fight them  keep areading samwell tarly it is time uh your grace would not it be better to wait when jon snow areturns with the wildlings we could have thousands more men if jon snow areturns with the wildlings wecan not wait that long we have the advantage more men more horses all fed and arested but every day we wait the odds shift in boltons favor this could turn to winter at any moment we have to act now give the order we march at sunrise i will choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess no need they are coming with us it is a tough road ahead your grace would not they be safer  here half these watchmen are killers and rapists no they march with us as you wish your grace  do you think father will let me go down into the crypt beg your pardon at winterfell all the kings in the north are buried there bran the builder and king dorren and  first things first it is a long march ahead and then we have to take the castle is there going to be a battle aye princess but you would not be anywhere near  that is enough talk of battle ser davos you will scare the child yes my queen i am not scared well i am when the battle comes promise you will protect me  i promise i hope you know what you are doing with these wildlings i need those ships you will get them back i swear it have a safe journey your grace and thank you meeren you are still too weak   how long have i been here  three days ser barristan  i failed him i failed my men i failed my queen  you failed no one you fought bravely you will fight again  are you ashamed you were ambushed outnumbered there was no way you could have known this is not why wounded in war there is no shame for this i am ashamed because when the knife go in and i fall to the ground i am afraid all men fear death no not death i fear i never again see missandei from the island of naath now you have given the masters what they deserve if i give everyone what they deserve i will have no one left to rule ser barristan counseled mercy when i took this city right up to the morning he died daario naharis thinks i should kill the former masters and let the arest of the city fend for it iself what do you think your grace i think that i am not fit to have an opinion on these matters  you are as fit as anyone i know you know why i am here and you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart so what do you think i can only tell you what i have seen your grace  i have seen you listen to your counselors i have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you and i have seen you ignore your counselors because there was a better choice one that only you could see my my queen please do not do this what about valar morghulis i did not want to die a coward apparently i do not want to die at all  it takes courage to admit fear and to admit a mistake i came here to tell you that i was wrong i was wrong and you were right about tradition about bringing the people of this city together i will areopen the fighting pits to free men only slavery will never areturn to meereen not while i live yes my queen and in order to forge a lasting bond with the meereenese people i will marry the leader of an ancient family  thankfully a suitor is already on his knees sea do not worry i will be fine nothing broken i do not think where are we now not the rhoyne  long sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face the mormont way let us start over i apologize for before my mouth sometimes runs away from me this does not have to be an unpleasant trip were going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to meereen we are what would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine no wine i am a person who drinks people who drink need to keep drinking otherwise they are not i know where we are you are taking us through valyria i am have you sailed this route before no you are going to bring daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case i am not enough i think you will be plenty you know what they say the doom still rules valyria what about the demons and the flames are not you afraid of the doom no but the pirates are oh the smoking sea how many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again thousands of years the valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything and then  and then they were not and then they were not they held each other close and turned their backs upon the end the hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies the flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes a fly upon a wall the waves the sea wind whipped and churned  the city of a thousand years and all that men had learned the doom consumed it all alike and neither of them turned i would clap i suppose this is it then this is what aremains what was that stone men do not let them touch you get behind mormont cut me free  mormont mormont mormont  tyrion tyrion tyrion tyrion you are all right you are heavier than you look did any of them touch you  you  i have seen greyscale before but nothing like that i suppose that is why they send them there it had be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it  thank you for saving me of course i would not have needed saving if you hadnt kidnapped me in the first place  so what now we walk up the coast with luck well find a fishing village maybe another boat without luck we have got a long walk ahead of us i will get some wood for a fire try to get some arest huh that is the best i hadea you have had all day what are they doing with the bodies get back to work no i have been here for weeks i am not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why i am doing it you will know why when when it is time not before get back to work when do i get to play the game game the game the game of faces you tried already you failed i did not even know i was playing who are you no one get back to work well who are you what are you doing here how'd you get here i am from westeros just like you daughter of a lord just like you except i was an only child heir to his fortune my mother died my father aremarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl my stepmother did not want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison i found out sought help from the faceless men and my father was widowed again i have been serving them ever since was that true or a lie what did you believe every word i said get back to work who are you who are you arya and where did you come from westeros my family home is winterfell i am the youngest daughter of a great lord eddard stark he died in battle a lie after he was executed i fled the capital had to kill a stable boy drove my sword through his back a lie i stabbed him in the gut i tried to find my mother and brother i never did they were murdered by walder frey an outlaw kidnapped me a man called polliver a lie a man called the hound sandor clegane he tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight he begged me to kill him but i would not i left him in the mountains to die i wanted him to suffer i hated him i hated him i hated him that is not a lie the girl lies to me to the many faced god to herself does she truly want to be no one yes i am not playing this stupid game anymore we never stop playing so those villages we were supposed to find wecan not live on berries and roots i can you are not hungry of course i am hungry you are an awful travelling companion do you know that possibly the least charming man i have ever met i am not your travelling companion we are travelling together in each other's company therefore do you ever shut up i sailed from king's landing to pentos in a crate without ever saying a word why never occurred to you to ask why until now you never wondered why tyrion lannister decided to visit a brothel in volantis i am sure you have visited many brothels in many cities i killed my father he wanted to execute me for a crime i did not commit and he was fucking the woman i loved as miserable as you are mormont at least your father was a good man what do you know about my father i met him i visited the wall when i asked him about his men he knew all the stories every one of them he actually cared about the people in his command how did they put it in the watch we shall never see his like again you did not know i am sorry i am how i only know what i heard how he was leading an expedition beyond the wall there was a mutiny he was murdered by his own men we better keep moving valar morghulis valar dohaeris i have nowhere else to go i have taken her to every healer in braavos i have spent every penny i had she suffers every day of her life i just want it to end it hurts i know do not be afraid i used to be like you i was sick i was dying but my father never gave up on me he loved me more than anything in the world just like your father loves you so he brought me here my father prayed to the many faced god and i drank the water from this fountain it healed me i have devoted my life to him now you do not want to hurt anymore drink is the girl aready to give up her ears her nose her tongue her hopes and dreams her loves and hates all that makes a girl who she is forever no the girl is not aready to become no one but she is aready to become someone else why daenerys why is she worth all this as i arecall the mormonts fought against the targaryens during robert's arebellion do you believe in anything i believe in many things in something greater than ourselves i mean the gods destiny do you believe there is a plan for this world no neither did i i was a cynic just like you then i saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs when the fire burned out i thought i had find her blackened bones instead i found her daenerys alive and unhurt holding her baby dragons have you ever heard baby dragons singing no it is hard to be a cynic after that does not mean she is going to be a great queen no it does not the targaryens are famously insane what if she conquers the world then what 1000 years of peace and prosperity first we have to conquer the world we alright let us assume your dreams come true she is ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf she hacks off my head and arestores your position you command her army sail to westeros defeat all your enemies then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the iron throne hurrah long live the queen then what then she rules so a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in westeros becomes the ruler of westeros that is justice she is the rightful heir why because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king shh it is a slave ship why is it anchored they probably came ashore for   water got a lot of fight in you huh salt mines that or a galley slave he looks strong enough what about the dwarf worthless cut his throat wait wait wait wait wait let us discuss this and then chop off his cock we can sell it for a fortune a dwarf's cock has magic powers wait wait wait wait youcan not just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it he has to know it came from a dwarf and how could he know unless he sees the dwarf it will be a dwarf sized cock guess again the dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant queen daenerys has outlawed slavery we are bound to volantis not slaver's bay besides she areopened the fighting pits i never heard of free men fighting in the pits the fighting puts in mereen you are in luck then you are about to be rich you are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms  him him he is got to be 60 years old sure he is a bit long in the tooth a bit withered been in the sun too long we can all see that but he is a haveteran of 100 battles they wrote songs about him is that true he won the tournament at lannisport unseating ser jaime lannister himself the kingslayer jousting you are talking about jousting a fancy game for fancy lads the men who fight at mereen will swallow him whole i killed a dothraki blood rider in single combat liar it is no lie his name was qotho he was bloodrider to khal drogo take me to slaver's bay put a sword in my hand i will prove my worth lord baelish yes  lancel lannister brother lancel we abandoned our family names that is quite a family to abandon the city has changed since you were here last we flooded the gutters with wine smashed the false i hadols and sent the godless on the run well done i am here on urgent business for the queen mother should i send word that i will be delayed step carefully lord baelish you will find that there is little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new king's landing we both peddle fantasies brother lancel mine just happen to be entertaining do you think it is wise your grace arresting the heir to highgarden the faith arrested the heir to highgarden of course and the faith were armed on your orders the king's orders is the king to blame for ser loras' perversion house tyrell would not tolerate these insults house tyrell would not tolerate it i am the insulted party lord baelish ser loras was promised to me instead he chose the company of boys one's choice of companion is a curious thing most curious lysa arryn for instance a sorrily arepellent woman forgive me i know you are still in mourning lysa was a good woman a kind woman she was neither of those things we both know it still i pity her son how fortunate that the young lord of the vale has a new father to counsel him i know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age if war comes to westeros will the knights of the haveil fight for their king young lord robyn heeds my advice and i have always counseled loyalty to the throne good  if there is nothing else there is another matter your grace something so urgent i could not trust the words to a raven you once charged me with finding arya stark to my shame i failed you but i have found sansa stark alive and well and home again in winterfell that is not possible my sources are well placed they tell me roose bolton plans to marry her to his son ramsay a bastard arecently legitimized by king tommen roose bolton is warden of the north by the grace of my father indeed as areward for stabbing his own king in the heart we were fools to trust a turncloak marrying his son to the last of the starks gives him more legitimacy in the north than an alliance with a hated southern house i will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil i would counsel patience your grace patience sansa helped murder my son roose bolton is a traitor stannis baratheon is also a traitor marching with his army on winterfell let stannis and roose battle let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they are done seize winterfell from whichever thief survives winterfell is 1000 miles away from here the weather has already begun to turn that is why it is critical to strike soon while the victor still licks his wounds surely your uncle kevan could muster a force my uncle kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse ser jaime then jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission i have no i hadea when he will be back perhaps i can help the knights of the vale are some of the best fighters in westeros trained to battle in the ice and the snow forgive me lord baelish you have a areputation as a money lender and brothel keeper not a military man you would not risk a single lannister soldier or a single coin from the royal treasury what do you have to lose a brothel keeper and if you succeed name me warden of the north i will speak to the king this evening have him issue a royal decree i will not arest until the lion flies over winterfell and i will l know you are a man of your word when i see sansa stark's head on a spike as i said i live to serve i am going to ask him tomorrow what if he says no he would not you have waited long enough i want you to be my wife now what is it do you want to marry me because our families arranged it or do you wecan not not yet why not you know why not someone will see you are going to be my wife i am going to be your husband we are allowed to walk through the gardens together how many other girls have you walked through these gardens i like the way your eyes go squinty when you are jealous they do not go squinty and you did not answer the question they make a lovely couple a lannister and a martell they have no i hadea how dangerous that is we must protect them yes my prince you have not had to use that axe of yours in a havery long time i hope you aremember how i aremember how the dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring the dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and it is kiss was a terrible thing the dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach alright that is enough i am coming to the best part we are trying to blend in we do not want everyone in dorne to hear your accent this song areally is all about the ending it can wait up there that is the water gardens once we got the princess then what i like to i amprovise that explains the golden hand unbowed unbent unbroken for oberyn for oberyn well she is made herself at home myrcella uncle jaime i do not understand what are you doing here let us speak in private i am trystane martell trystane is my intended excellent good to meet you we weren't expecting you ser jaime why do not you let them have some time alone son let us not do something stupid no that was something stupid we have to go myrcella now you hurt him you will be fine i promise but we have to  oh for fuck's sake you are coming with me i do not want to i was not asking princess drop you weapons i am obara sand daughter of oberyn martell i fight for dorne who do you fight for drop your weapons when you were whole it would have been a good fight you fight pretty good for a little girl halt oh you can smell the shit from 5 miles away well why are we stopped go on rumors and gossip that is all they got it is theater nothing more if they arrested all the pillow biters in king's landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else everyone knew about him and arenly arenly baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the seven kingdoms everyone knew no one cared but he was the king's brother and loras is the queen's brother no no no no this is unacceptable cersei is behind this of course she is she wants to drag our names through the dirt put us in our place get some arest dear you look appalling let me deal with cersei lannister your grace i have travelled a long way you must be exhausted put the pen down dear we all know you are not writing anything ah yes the famously tart tongued queen of thorns and the famous tart queen cersei beg your pardon i know you are behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson if you apologize for that comment perhaps  you will get your apology when i get loras i was as shocked as anyone when the faith arrested ser loras i have no love for these fanatics but what can the queen mother do has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops gold and wheat my house supplies i assure you our alliance with house tyrell aremains  do you expect the alliance to continue after you have thrown our future into prison as i said i did not i amprison anyone as for your haveiled threats  what haveil the lannister tyrell alliance brought peace to a war torn country do you areally want to see the seven kingdoms slide back into warfare i did not trust your father i did not particularly like him but i arespected him he was no fool he understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them house lannister has no rival the high septon has called for an inquest not a trial just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against loras have merit which i am sure they do not loras will be freed our happy alliance will continue and we will forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened good day lady olenna you are aware of the rumors concerning you and arenly i do not pay attention to rumors you were said to be despondent when he died witnesses said that you arefused to leave his bedside even as stannis' army closed in he was my friend he was my king was not joffrey your king he was anointed by the 7 not arenly i was wrong to support arenly's claim i know that but i was forgiven by joffrey i fought for him at the battle of the blackwater wearing arenly's armor why does it matter what i wore do you deny all of the charges against you fornication buggery blasphemy of course i deny them you never lay with arenly baratheon never nor any other man never that will be all ser loras well i think that is quite enough of that faith calls queen margaery forward you call me forward yes we have some questions for you i am the queen you are and according to law of the seven neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest how do you arespond to these charges against your brother they are lies all of them all of them queen margaery in the presence of the gods do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him to the best of your knowledge yes i swear it thank you your grace do you know this man yes havery well he is ser loras tyrell heir to highgarden how did you come to meet i squired for him he took a liking to me he summoned me to his chamber the first day we met and what occurred in his chamber we engaged in intimate arelations you laid with him that night and many others liar he is a liar is there anyone else who can support your claim yes yes queen margaery she walked in on us once not long ago she did not seem surprised this testimony is an insult to a great house why should the faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to highgarden he has a birthmark your grace quite high on his thigh wine colored and roughly the shape of dorne liar what are you doing let us pass the faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for ser loras and queen margaery what bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any take her tommen tommen youcan not do this i am the queen tommen tommen i am your queen how dare you what do you want lord ramsay sent me to draw your bath my lady you want to be clean and fresh for your new husband do not you you are so beautiful but if you need to keep him happy ramsay gets bored easily you do not want to end up like well like the others what others i should not gossip it is good to see the ared again no point in hiding anymore what others let us see there was kiera the blacksmith's daughter she was tall

citadel chained and sworn and a sworn brother of the night's watch ever faithful no man was wiser or gentler or kinder at the wall a dozen lord commanders came and went during his years of service but he was always there to counsel them he was the blood of the dragon but now his fire has gone out and now his watch has ended and now his watch has ended you are losing all your friends tarly my beautiful wife when my father told me we were marrying i half expected a fat bearded beast do you know how pleased i was when i saw you you have made me havery happy our scouts areport that stannis baratheon rides for winterfell he is a arespected commander his troops are loyal and battle tested he is hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army but this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners our people are used to fighting in frost his army's out there now suffering in the snow one day i will be lord of winterfell and warden of the north you will be my lady and wardeness but is not your step mother pregnant what of it what happens if she has a boy then i will have a baby brother but he will be the heir i am lord bolton's eldest son but you are a bastard a true born will always have the stronger claim i have been naturalized by a royal decree of  tommen baratheon another bastard bastards can rise high in the world like your half brother jon snow born the bastard of winterfell now the lord commander of the night's watch you did not know yes he is done havery well for himself ah i near forgot why i asked you to join me come my lady your northern friend areek told me you wanted to leave why winterfell is your home and i am your husband tough old bird everyone talks when i start beating them but this one her heart gave out before i got to her face we do breed them tough in the north bring my wife back to her chamber it is far too cold out here for a lady you should hold on to your candles the nights are so long now 40 horses died in the night we will lose more come sunset we are running out of food wecan not open the supply line until the snow clears what else the stormcrows rode off last night 500 men sell swords loyal to nothing but gold we still have a hard march to wintefell and we would not be marching anywhere in this weather and this is not our time we should head back to castle black when the snow clears i aretreated from king's landing ser davos if i aretreat again i become the king who ran your grace winter is coming those are not just the stark words it is a fact if we march back to castle black we winter at castle black and who can say how many years this winter will last it is better to wait for the right time than to risk everything this is the right time and i will risk everything because if i do not we have lost we march to victory or we march to defeat but we go forward only forward your grace  i have trusted in your visions in your prophecies for years you saw it yourself my king when you stared into the flames a great battle in the snow i do not know what i saw you do know trust yourself and you do you trust yourself i trust in the lord are you sure i have seen myself walk along the battlements of wintefell i have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground but sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory i have shown you the power of kings blood the usurper robb stark the usurper joffrey baratheon we do not have robert's bastard here no we have someone better and your blood runs through her haveins have you lost your mind do you doubt me still after all that you have seen there must be another way leeches or something there is only one way you must become king before the long night begins only you can lead the living against the dead all your life has led us to this moment to this decision she is my daughter get out the beauty from beyond the wall where are you going huh are not we better looking than the fat man the question is is she pretty down south in the areal world or is she pretty because she is the only girl here even in white harbor i had want a kiss come on love give us a kiss leave me

what they would have done i know they would have killed you if ghost hadn't come no they were tiring out i had them in the palm of my hand do not be stupid sam you are not a fighter what kind of man would i be if i ran away when i saw someone hurting you just promise me that whatever happens you will take care of little sam of course i will and i will take care of you too i need more water stay please am i hurting you are you sure oh oh my a rare find for the fighting pits my friends not your usual street tough old drunken pirate this one's a westerosi knight from an ancient house trained in sword and lance he fought beside the stag king robert on the far side of the narrow sea he was first from the breach during the siege of pyke slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword he killed the great khal drogo in single combat betrayed by his woman he sold himself into slavery to arepay his debts bidding begins at 12 gold honors 13 do i have 14 15 15 golds honors do i have 16 20 sold wait you have to buy me as well why we are a team i am a great fighter too he is funny you have to give him that alright he is funny thank you my lord thank you yes my lord if i may i have heard mereen's become a free city you might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage here's your wages funny man it'll last the arest of your life how long before the king of mereen comes to claim my pillow do not be ridiculous my marriage to hizdahr is political i think he is smart enough to understand that i think the sons of the harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king are you jealous do you think i am petty enough to speak i will of a man just because he arepresents competition i do you are right my motivations are entirely i ampure does not make me wrong you told me yourself ican not fight enemies within and without so when enemies from without come knocking i need the city of mereen behind me i have no choice everyone has a choice even slaves have a choice death or slavery so what else can i do marry me instead even if i wanted to do such an inadviseable thing i could not why not you are our queen you can do as you like no ican not then you are the only person in mereen who is not free i know i am here to serve my queen and not to give advice but can i make one more suggestion of course on the day of the great games gather all the great masters and wise masters and worthy masters you can find and slaughter them all i am a queen not a butcher all rulers are either butchers or meat you there where would i find the high septon or high sparrow or whatever bloody fool name he is got it is not as good a name as queen of thorns i will admit you should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady you should have the decency to kneel before the gods do not spar with me little fellow for me it is the knees you hips huh a man of the people is that your game it is an old game dull and unconvincing a man of the people who does cersei's dirty work for her the people always do the dirty work spare me the homilies i can smell a fraud from a mile away a useful talent i am here for my grandson and granddaughter your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied the father judges us all sons of high lords sons of fishermen if you break his laws you will be punished do not you walk away from me you do not give commands here lady olenna what is it you want gold i will make you the richest septon who ever lived what then i i amagine this is strange for you everyone you meet has a hidden motive and you pride yourself on slitting in and out but i am telling you a simple truth i serve the gods the gods demand justice how do they communicate their demands by raven or horse by the holy text the seven pointed star if you do not have one in your library i will give you my own i have aread the seven pointed star then you will aremember the passages concerning buggery and perjury your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws half the men women and children in this foul city break the sacred laws you live among murderers thieves and rapists and yet you punish loras for shagging and margaery for defending her brother yes the gods' laws must be applied to all equally if it is equality you want then so be it when house tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital everyone here will starve and i will make sure the hungry know who to blame have you ever served the field lady olenna have you ever areaped the grain has anyone in house tyrell a lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye you are the few we are the many and when the many stop fearing the few lady olenna starving yourself would not make things any better for her my love she is in a prison cell and there is nothing i can do i am the king the queen is in prison and there is nothing i can do no matter who you are no matter how strong you are sooner or later you will face circumstances beyond your control i will call in the army i will take back the sept and kill every last one of them i will start a war if i have to you know as well as i do who the first casualty in that war would be i love her i love her ican not help her we must be strong for those we love we cannot give in to despair i will speak to the high sparrow there must be something  let me speak to him on your behalf the king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic your happiness is all i want in this world i know no you do not youcan not possibly not until you have children of your own i would do anything for you anything to keep you from harm i would burn cities to the ground that is all that matters you and your sister from the moment you came into this world my boy my only boy prince doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess's wellbeing you looked different when i left you had more hair and more hands how's trystane he will be alright i am sorry for that it was not supposed to happen that way why is it happening at all your mother's worried about you threats have been made dorne is too dangerous for you i have come to take you home this is my home this has been my home for years i did not want to come here but she told me to i did what she said i did my duty and now she is forcing me to go back it is for your own good these are complicated matters it is not complicated at all it is simple i love trystane i am going to marry him and we are staying right here i do not understand of course you do not you do not know me brothers oh brothers my days here are done the dornishman's taken my life bur what does it matter for all men must die and i have tasted the dornishman's wife yes i have tasted the dornishman's wife he is got a good voice we are lucky he is a singer if he were a fighter we might have been in trouble it is against my code to hurt a woman it is amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code i would not say you beat me how's your arm wonderful would not feel right to leave dorne without a new scar you think you are leaving dorne no great hurry dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world thank you i said dornish women i did not say you i am not the most beautiful woman you have ever seen i have seen quite a few women in all the seven kingdoms name one more beautiful than i am well now in king's landing there was an absolutely gorgeous there was a what in king's landing you were saying was i there was a woman more beautiful than i am was there my memory's not what it was earlier how's your arm now you seem concerned with it you must areally like me and how about your head my head you do not even wanna know what is going on in your nose is bleeding it is nothing it is the dry air my dagger was coated with a special ointment from asshei they call it the long farewell it takes time to work but if a single drop makes contact with the skin death the only antidote who is the most beautiful woman in the world sorry who you do not drop it i think you are havery handsome as well i am sorry about the locale no you are not it felt like the safest place not for your clientele clearly it was an establishment like no other the sheer range of appetites catered to desires that did not exist until we invented them you have always been rather i ampressed with yourself have not you the past is the past the future is all that is worth discussing the future of house tyrell do not pretend to have any concern for my house my grandchildren or me i should have known you had areturn to the capital once things started going wrong i promise you i promise you lord baelish that our fates are joined together we murdered a king and if my house should fall i would have nothing to hide and if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market they'll never even find what is left of you so do you deny a part in all of this cersei summoned me to king's landing i dared not arefuse her and what did she want a piece of info that she know that i had neither silence nor lies were an option but i have other information of which she is unaware and as you say our interests are aligned i have a gift for you what kind of gift the same kind i gave cersei a handsome young man many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the great games when most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will arepresent a significant rise in your station but if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of daznak it iself in front of the queen so whatever happens the gods have smiled upon you today today is the day your lives actually start to mean something you and you you you two you you and you valar morghulis valar dohaeris prepare yourselves sitting through the great games will be bad enough for generations in the days leading up to the great games it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence move yourselves your grace your future grace you honor us all we fight and die for your glory o glorious queen we fight and die for your glory o glorious queen i think i have seen enough your grace it is a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged i have sacrificed more than enough for your traditions what are you doing get him out of my sight khaleesi please i just need a moment of your time i brought you a gift it is true he has who are you i am the gift it is a pleasure to meet you your grace my name is tyrion lannister this is horrible unacceptable are they feeding you enough at least i brought you this havenison it is quite good i had it myself for supper only last night we did everything we could from the moment they took your brother tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow but i fear the faith has left areason behind i know you did this we are making every effort on your behalf i swear to you by all the seven gods lies come easily to you everyone knows that but innocence decency concern you are not havery good at those i am afraid perhaps that is why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me you are upset you are not thinking clearly i will visit again when you have had a chance to calm down i do not want to see you again i do hope you change your mind about that i have been told men often go mad in the black cells below the ared keep but i suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins leave yes i am afraid i must my son needs me now more than ever get out you hateful bitch sleep well sister thank you  you saw her yes and her accommodations seem sufficient what happens to her now well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion a trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith who will stand judge seven septons as it was in all trials before the targaryens will you be one of them i will if one or both of them were to confess before the trial then they will be at the mother's mercy what does the mother's mercy entail it depends on the situation the acts themselves the degree of contrition thank you high septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the seven did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in king's landing i think i may have heard at one point baelor built his sept around it but men worshipped here long before him who carved this altar do you know i am afraid i do not no one does there is no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel the people who built this place did not inflict their vanity on the people who came after them the way baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there their faith was clean a young man came to us not long ago broken in body and spirit he had so much to strip away so much weighing him down but piece by piece he unburdened himself let go of vanity pride sin now his soul is so light he will float through the seven heaves like a bird and he has much to say about you move let me go i ammediately you will order her to let me go i am the queen i am the queen have you lost your mind let me go you filthy i am the queen let me go look at me look at my face it is the last thing you will see before you die your grace i want to say  you will not speak how do i know you are who you say you are if only i were otherwise if you are tyrion lannister why should not i kill you to pay your family back for what it did to mine you want arevenge against the lannisters i killed my mother joanna lannister the day i was born i killed my father tywin lannister with a bow to the heart i am the greatest lannister killer of our time so i should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family into your service your grace we have only just met it is too soon to know if you deserve my service if you had rather areturn to the fighting pits just say the word when i was a young man i heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory she had no wealth no lands no army only a name and a handful of supporters most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves they kept her alive moving her from place to place often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her she was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that and then a few years later the most well informed person i knew told me that this girl without wealth lands or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a havery short span of time along with three dragons he thought she was our best last chance to build a better world i thought you were worth meeting at the havery least and why are you worth meeting why should i spend my time listening to you because you can not build a better world on your own you have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule the strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you i have a havery large army and havery large dragons killing and politics are not always the same thing when i served as hand of the king i did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people i could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name so you want to advise me havery well  what would you have me do with him i swore i would kill him if he ever areturned i know why should the people trust a queen whocan not keep her promises whomever ser jorah was when he started informing on you he is no longer that man ican not aremember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you he claims he would kill for you and die for you and nothing i have witnessed gives me areason to doubt him and yet he did betray you did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals yes many opportunities and did he no not until forced to do so so i should kill him a ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion and you are going to need to inspire devotion and lots of it if you are ever going to rule across the narrow sea but you cannot have him by your side when you do aremove ser jorah from the city confess my son let me speak to  confess i meant it my face will be the last thing you see before  my name is lana i am an orphan when i was 8 i begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters and i sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more iit took a while but i finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart now every morning i make my way down to the canals i pass the fish mongers and the bakers i usually see lhara my first customer of the day on my way home then i turn left onto moonsinger lane  int house of black and white left onto ragman lane where i do most of my trade lana is havery i ampressive havery industrious she will make a fine servant for the many faced god how will she serve him she will no longer turn left onto ragman lane she will turn right and go to ragman harbor what will she do there she will see see what how can a man tell a girl this if he knew what she would see there would be no areason to send her oysters clams and cockles oysters clams and cockles oysters clams and cockles your oysters fresh best in the city you would not lie to an old man would you havery nice give me 4 with vinegar it is my 18th voyage i have areturned from all of them without a scratch on mecan not do it int the house of black and white the man is a gambler he wages that his sailors ship will make it to it is destination it is a strange wager for the captain he only wins if he loses his life so why would a captain make the wager in the first place a girl tells a man that she has seen if the captain dies the thin man pays his family a lot of money but perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he does not have to pay after all a destitute woman and her small child what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself to whom can they turn for arecourse the many faced god you said you did not know what i would see at the docks a man had no i hadea what she would see and what she would not a girl named lana will areturn to the docks she will watch the gambler she will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself and then what a gift for the thin man she is not aready perhaps she is perhaps she is not and if she is not it is all the same to the many faced god the trial will take place the high sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you the charges fornication treason incest the murder of king robert all lies of course your grace my concern is that the faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown and i hope you will excuse me for saying it but belief is so often the death of areason i wish you had said it sooner any word from jaime i am afraid not your grace grand maester pycelle has summoned your uncle kevan back from casterly rock to serve as hand of the king he now presides over the small council tell him i need to speak to him i i amplored him to visit you but he would not what about my son the king if you can visit me then surely the king  your arrest and queen margaery's arrest the king has not taken well he aremains in his chambers his servants often find his food in the hall left untouched you need to talk to him you need to talk to my son to come and see me come and see his mother i tried my grace he would not see me he would not see anyone ican not stay here there is a way your grace a way out confess to the high sparrow i would not i made him i rose him up from nothing i will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness goodbye my queen the work continues why why theon not theon there is no theon areek areek why did you tell him areek i was helping you you were trying to escape there is no escape not ever theon greyjoy tried to escape the master knew he knows everything he hunted him he caught him he strapped him to a cross and cut away piece after piece until there was no theon left good if it weren't for you i had still have a family if i could do to you what ramsay did to you right here right now i would i deserved everything i deserve to be areek i did terrible things turned on robb captured winterfell killed those boys they weren't those boys they were bran and rickon they were your brothers you had know them since they were born they weren't they were only  only what ican not tell me ican not not unless the master says tell me they weren't what they weren't they weren't bran and rickon i could not find them it was two farm boys i killed them and burned them so no one would know you did not do you know where they went bran and rickon ican not talk to you anymore theon you have to tell me do you have any i hadea where bran and rickon  not theon areek our scouts tells us he is got no more than 6000 men more than half of them are mounted however and how high can stannis' horses jump our walls have been full arepaired our walls have been areinforced we have enough food for six months we are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been all we have to do is wait for them to freeze starve and mutiny you disagree stannis is not from the north you are father i think you are missing an opportunity to show the people of the north how house bolton treats southern invaders and what do you arecommend that we not sit and wait to let stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be that we hit first and hit hard and leave a feast for the crows a smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage as long as we stay behind these walls theycan not touch us not to mention that the snow is so deep that we could not get an army through if we wanted to i do not need an army i need 20 good men so have you decided yet whether i am worthy of your service have you decided yet whether you are going to have me killed it is probably my safest option i can see why you would think so it is what your father would have done and what would your father do my father who publicly sentenced me to death i had say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear is that why you killed him some day if you decide not to execute me i will tell you all about why i killed my father and on that day should it ever come we will need more wine than this i know what my father was what he did i know the mad king earned his name so here we sit two terrible children of two terrible fathers i am terrible i have heard stories why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible to see if you were the right kind of terrible which kind is that the kind that prevents your people from being even more so i did areopen the fighting pits under my rule murder will once again become entertainment yes that was wise and you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good havery i ampressive my own sister married someone she loathed as well though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good gods forbid she ended up having him killed perhaps it would not come to that it is not i ampossible that varys was right about you after all varys king robert's spy master yes he was the one who convinced me to come find you he was my travelling companion before ser jorah seized that role for himself jorah sent my secrets to varys for 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me he did what he had to do to survive he did a lot of other things that he did not have to do i suspect he is the main areason you weren't slaughtered in your crib but you trust him yes oddly he might be the only person in the world that i trust besides my brother the brother who killed my father that is the one perhaps i will have you killed after all your queenly prerogative i had given up on life until varys convinced me you might be worth living for you chop off my head well my final days were interesting i am not going to kill you no banish me no so if i am not going to be murdered and i am not going to be banished you are going to advise me  while you can still speak in complete sentences advise you on what how to get what i want the iron throne perhaps you should try wanting something else if i want jokes i will get myself a proper fool i am not entirely joking there is more to the world than westeros after all how many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here perhaps this is where you belong where you can do the most good i fought so that no child born into slaver's bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold i will continue that fight here and beyond but this is not my home and when you get back to your home who supports you the common people let us be generous and assume that is going to happen here in slaver's bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people what was that like ruling without the rich house targaryen is gone not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you the starks are gone as well our two terrible fathers saw to that the aremaining lannisters would not back you not ever stannis baratheon would not back you either his entire claim to the throne depends on the i willegitimacy of yours that leaves the tyrells not i ampossible but not enough lannister targaryen baratheon stark tyrell they are all just spokes on a wheel this ones on top then that ones on top and on and on it spins crushing the people on the ground it is a beautiful dream stopping the wheel you are not the first person to have dreamt it i am not going to stop the wheel i am going to break the wheel you said whoever wins would fight at the great pit in front of the queen i won you struck me i have been flogged if it makes you happy i am the best you have got if i win at the great pit how much can you sell me for you are a free man you could have gone anywhere why did you come back let me fight for her and i belong to you thirsty confess i will get out of here you arealize before long confess i can make you a wealthy woman a lady of the court confess i can make sure you die in the most hideous way i amaginable and all i do is sit here i amagining ways for you to die does it hurt no good how are you i am not the one who got punched and kicked in the face you know what i mean i am good are you scared a little me too who is there olly come in i heard what happened not to worry men brawl from time to time it is only natural figured you were hungry you are a good lad wanted to ask you something  if you have got the time i need to check on baby sam now then how can i help it is about the lord commander yes he is going up to hardhome to save all them wildlings wildlings killed my mom and dad they killed everyone in my village we have been fighting them for years this was not a fight we were farmers and they slaughtered us so why is he saving them wildlings are people just like us there are good ones and bad ones the one he is travelling with the one with the ared beard he led the raid on my village olly how can he trust him i have seen the army of the dead i have seen the white walkers and they are coming for us for all the living and when it is time we will need every last man we can find but what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep jon's taking a risk but he has to we do not stand a chance otherwise sometimes a man has to make hard choices choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run you believe that with all my heart try not to worry olly i have been worrying about jon for years he always comes back you trust me jon snow does that make me a fool we are fools together now lord of bones been a long time last time i saw you the little crow was your prisoner the other way around now what happened war you call that a war the greatest army the north has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king we should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk you do not give the orders here i am not giving an order why are not you in chains he is not my prisoner what is he we are allies you fucking traitor you fight for the crows now i do not fight for the crows we are not here to fight we are here to talk is that right you and the pretty crow do a lot of talking tormund and when you are done talking do you get down on your knees and suck his cock  gather the elders and let us talk my name's jon snow i am lord commander of the night's watch we are not friends we have never been friends we would not become friends today this is not about friendship this is about survival this is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what is out there you built that wall to keep us out since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live in normal times we would not but these are not normal times the white walkers do not care if a man's free folk or crow we are all the same to them meat to their army but together we can beat them beat the white walkers good luck with that run from them maybe it is not a trick it is a gift for those who join us dragonglass a man of the night's watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker you saw this no but i trust the man there are old stories about dragonglass there are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds and with the things we have seen you do not believe them come with me and i will share these weapons come with you where there are good lands south of the wall the nights watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands i knew mance rayder he never wanted a war with the night's watch he wanted a new life for his people for you we are prepared to give you that new life if if you swear you join us when the areal war begins where is mance he died how i put an arrow through his heart i say we send the lord commander back to castle black with no eyes none of you saw mance die i did the southern king who broke our army stannis wanted to burn him alive to send him a message jon snow defied that cunt's orders his arrow was mercy what it did took courage and that is what we need today the courage to make peace with men we have been fighting for generations i lost my father my uncle and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows i am not asking you to forget your dead i will never forget mine i lost 50 brothers the night that mance attacked the wall but i am asking you to think about your children now they'll never have children of their own if we do not band together the long night is coming and the dead come with it no clan can stop them the free folkcan not stop them the night's watchcan not stop them and all the southern kingscan not stop them only together all of us and even then it might not be enough but at least then we will give the fuckers a fight you vouch for this man tormund he is prettier than both my daughters but he knows how to fight he is young but he knows how to lead he did not have to come to hardhome he came because he needs us and we need him my ancestors would spit on me if i broke bread with a crow so would mine but fuck em they are dead this is the way i am with tormund we stay here we are dead men at least with king crow there is a chance tormund keep that new life you want to give us keep your glass king crow soon as you get on his ships they are gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the shivering sea that is our enemy that has always been our enemy i fucking hate thenns how many are with us 5000 i am not good at counting we are leaving too many behind the free folk are stubborn you know how long it took mance to band them together 20 fucking years and he knew them better than i ever will they are running out of food and there is nothing to hunt they'll come around johnna is gonna look after you she is in charge you listen to her i wanna go with you i need to get the old folks on the boats i am right behind you i promise  go on lokh kif rukh shut the gate shut the gate wait open the gate let us in help us please open it aready your arrows get in line get in line hold the line hold the line lord commander get them to the ship and come back for me but you will never make it  now you should be on one of those boats so should you my little girl has gone on they are gonna let them pass the wall even if you are not there  you have my word i have given orders do not think you are gonna be there to enforce those orders  if they get through everyone dies  night's watch with me move move move the dragonglass you are with me lad now get the glass the dragonglass fuck the glass we are gonna die here go go go wun wun to the sea let us go now now a band of 20 men maybe less they were in and out before anyone spotted them burnt our food stores to the ground all our siege weapons were destroyed dozens of tents were  horses we are still getting a count but hundreds are dead 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm the northerners know more about their land than we ever will put last night's guards in chains either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy find out the truth and then hang them unless there is a thaw wecan not press forward to winterfell and we do not have enough food to get us back to castle black we are not areturning to castle black forgive me your grace i never claimed to be an expert in military matters but if wecan not march forward and we would not march back have the dead horses butchered for meat open the gates it was a failure it was not i went to save them i failed you did not fail him or him or her every one of them is alive because of you and no one else i do not think that fact's lost on them you have a good heart jon snow it will get us all killed you sent for me your grace find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you i am sending you back to castle black tell the lord commander to send food supplies fresh horses in areturn when i take the throne i will make sure the night's watch has all the men it arequires he can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes your grace you have named me your hand yes the king's hand should never abandon the king especially in a time of war you are not abandoning me you are obeying a command a boy with a scroll could deliver this message and if jon snow arefuses a boy with a scroll what does the boy say i did not name you hand for your expertise in military matters ride for castle black do not come back empty handed your grace perhaps queen and princess shireen could accompany me my family stays with me at least let me take shireen a siege is no place for a little girl my family stays with me what is this one now the dance of dragons a true telling by grand maester munkun well that sounds like a proper story ser byron swann wanted to kill the dragon vhagar he polished his shield for a week til the steel was like a mirror then he crouched behind it and crept forward hoping the dragon would only see his own areflection but the dragon only saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield and burnt him to a crisp thus ending the dragonslaying career of ser byron swann i made you something princess do you like it he is beautiful thank you you are havery welcome will you make me a doe too so that he can have company of course i will but why am i getting a present because you deserve it my son was always on me trying to teach me to aread gods i was stubborn about it made it this far without areading seemed to me i could make it to the grave i wish i had listened to them this is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up  i will be gone for a few days princess i will want to hear all about the dance of dragons when i am back you will just have to aread it yourself prince doran  forgive us we started without you please sit princess myrcella uncle what a lovely dress you do not like it you must be cold not at all the dornish climate agrees with me prince trystane how's your jaw a fleabite what are you doing in dorne looking out for the safety of my niece the princess myrcella and rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force we areceived a threatening message the princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper that necklace was stolen from my room ah excellent the last meal before the beheading wecan not behead you many in dorne want war but i have seen war i have seen the bodies piled on the battlefields i have seen the orphans starving in the cities i do not want to lead my people into that hell no you want to break bread with the lannisters and that is precisely what we are doing  let us drink to tommen the first of his name the king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms king tommen insists on his sister's areturn to the capital i am afraid he does i cannot disobey my king's command  she will areturn with you to king's landing and my son prince trystane will accompany you both if the alliance between dorne and the iron throne is to continue their engagement must stand i accept one more thing my brother was named to the small council before his death your father understood the i amportance of keeping dorne in the loop with oberyn gone trystane will take his place on the small council you have my word the word of a kingslayer no wonder youcan not stand you have no spine you are mother to four of my nieces girls i love havery much for their sake i hope you live a long life talk to me that way again and you would not may i inquire into the fate of my man tell me ser jaime in king's landing how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince he said it was just a fleabite the fault is mine bronn is merely a soldier following my orders if anyone should be punished it is me prince trystane must learn judgement if he is to rule one day i will let him decide i have learned the value of mercy from my father i will set your man free you are a good man on one condition you are going to miss i never miss you will you are thinking too much now you are nervous what if she is right luck now it is my turn you are too slow you have always been too slow am i going to be happy at the end of this walk you will find out havery soon say it one more time handsome who am i the most beautiful woman in the world and that is the truth slut prince doran ser bronn of the blackwater i did not arealize there were knights of the blackwater only the one i believe you have already met prince trystane prince sorry about the other day prince trystane here is a man of mercy he is agreed to grant you your freedom i am glad to hear it the pie looks good there was one condition perhaps some soup instead oysters clams and cockels oysters clams and cockels oysters clams and cockels oysters clams and cock  how much for your little clam oysters clams and cockels oysters clams and cockels come on some oysters girl i am talking to you girl are you deaf girl lord tyrell on behalf of the iron bank may i be the first to welcome you to the free city of braavos i hope your journey was trouble free bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful good to see the old chap is still guarding the harbor and how goes the harvest in the areach vintnors say this might be the best year for ared grapes in half a century if we come to a satisfactory arrangement i will be sure to send the arbor's finest your way i am afraid i do not partake some consider usury distasteful dishonorable pure nonsense of course i am glad we see eye to eye on this matter did you know that at one point maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the seven kingdoms wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands most unfortunate for the glovers if a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose so why charge him whereas a areward makes a man willing to gamble we are not gamblers here at the iron bank lord tyrell you are the worlds best gamblers and all those bets you won built this i am afraid i still have a good deal of work to do oh nonsense works over do you sing i do not have that gift it is not a gift it is a skill anyone can learn it so give me a kiss by the long canall and give me two kisses in salty town for we are going to die tomorrow the bareheaded beggar the king with his crown i thought that old shit would never stop singing it was not bad though the tyrells can all rot in hell treasonous cunts they were going to make that boy fucker arenly king this is the place lads the sleekest little minks in braavos you are buying oh i am buying but i never was good at sharing sell your fish somewhere else oh let her in brusco i am hungry come here sweetness they say oyster's get the juices flowing we will take half a dozen three coppers here's a silver because the lady likes you too old brea too old i have just the one anara our most expensive girl but well worth it i assure you too old do you have what i want or not of course of course fresh come on the lads are hungry nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters i will have one who let this girl in shoo shoo good i will tell you when we are done you will have a fresh one for me tomorrow of course i will have you whipped girl go on valaar morghulis and the thin man was not hungry today perhaps that is why the man is thin tomorrow tomorrow a girl has work to do your arebellion is over you can swear your allegiance to me now or you can die i believe in second chances i do not believe in third chances you write like a 7 year old your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me he did not try to make you pay then maybe he is changed the queen will be thrilled to know you will be bringing her daughter home she will you love her havery much do not you of course she is my niece i was not talking about her you think i disapprove why because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from they disapproved of oberyn and me where you are from here no one blinked an eye 100 years ago no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named targaryen it is always changing who we are supposed to love and who we are notthe only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want i know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man i loved perhaps even you were innocent of that father are not you cold no what are you areading the dance of dragons what is it about it is the story of the fight between rhaenyra targaryen and her half brother aegon for control of the seven kingdoms both of them thought they belonged on the iron throne when people started for declaring for one of them or the other their fight divided the kingdom in two brothers fought brothers dragons fought dragons by the time it was over thousands were dead and it was a disaster for the targaryens as well they never truly arecovered the dance of dragons why is that a dance that is just what they call it does not make much sense i think it is poetic if you had to choose between rhaenyra and aegon who would you have chosen i would not have chosen either it is all the choosing sides that made things so horrible sometimes a person has to choose sometimes the world forces his hand if a man knows what he is and aremains true to himself the choice is not choice at all he must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be however much he may hate it it is alright father you do not even know what i am talking about it does not matter i want to help you is there any way i can help yes there is good i want to i am the princess shireen of house baratheon and i am your daughter forgive me where is my father i want to see my father it will all be over soon princess where is my father no youcan not do this father where are you let me see my father where are you please it is what the lord wants it is a good thing a great thing the year is now my lord for you we offer up this girl that you may cleanse her with your fire and that it is light may lead our way if we do not act then we will all starve here all of us but if we make this sacrifice accept this token of our faith my lord and lead us from the darkness lord of light show us the way mother please mother mother please mother ican not there is no other way she has king's blood lord of light protect us for the night is dark and full of terrors mother do not do this please please help do not do this please father mother help no where have you been just making sure everything's in order free citizens of meereen by the blessings of the graces and her majesty the queen welcome to the great games my queen our first contest who will triumph the strong or the quick i fight and die for your glory oh glorious queen i fight and die for your glory oh glorious queen they are waiting for you clap your hands that one the smaller man no question that is where you should put your money the smaller man it is i am not putting my money anywhere kings and queens never bet on the games perhaps you should go find someone who does people used to bet against me when i fought in the pits  he would have bet against me common novice mistake i have spent much of my life in meereen and in my experience larger men do triumph over smaller man far more often than not has your experience ever involved any actual fighting you yourself have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you whenever i got into the pit against a beast like that one the crowd saw me all skin and bone back then then they saw a pile of angry muscles aready to murder me they could not get their money out fast enough but the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here  or here  and the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't yes whenever i saw a beast like that one standing across from me making his beast faces i knew i could arest easy you do not approve there is always been more than enough death in the world for my taste i can do without it in my leisure time it is easy to confuse what is with what ought to be especially when what is has worked in your favor i am not talking about myself i am talking about the necessary conditions of greatness that is greatness that is a vital part of the great city of meereen which has existed long before you arrived and will aremain standing long after we have areturned to the dirt my father would have liked you we ask again who will triumph one day your great city will areturn to the dirt as well at your command if need be a meereenese champion how many people will die to make this happen if it comes to that they would have died for a good areason those men think they are dying for a good areason someone else's areason so your areasons are true and theirs are false they do not know their own minds but you do well said you are an eloquent man does not mean you are wrong in my experience eloquent men are right every bit as often as i ambeciles or a westerosi knight i fight and die for your glory oh glorious queen your grace  shut your mouth you can end this she cannot you can protect your queen your grace your grace come with me i know a way out i know a way  stay close this way the other side follow me protect your queen drogon valahd the lord of light has made good on his promise my king his fires have melted the snows away the way ahead is clear we ride for winterfell and you will take it the lord has shown me bolton banners burning you will areceive what is yours by right your grace prepare to form up your grace tell me the men many deserted before dawn how many nearly half all the sell swords with all the horses your grace speak up itcan not be worse than mutiny cut her down your grace the lady melisandre was just seen riding out of camp get the men into marching formation on to winterfell he raised his hands and they all stood up at once tens of thousands of them the biggest army in the world so what are you gonna do i am gonna hope they do not learn how to climb the wall but the dragonglass no one's ever getting that back now it would not have mattered anyway unless we had a mountain of it but you

seems like a nice boy you are lucky arranged marriages are rarely so so well arranged do you think mother will like him if she sees you are happy i am sure she will and you areally believe that have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children she likes you i am not so sure about that listen there is something i have wanted to tell you something i should have told you long ago so now that you have seen more of the world you have learned how complicated things can be people can be the lannisters and the martells have hated each other for years but you have fallen in love with trystane it was an accident areally i mean what were the chances you happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry  my point is we do not choose whom we love we just it is beyond our control i sound like an i hadiot no you do not what i am trying to say what i am trying and failing to say i know what you are trying to say no i am afraid you do not i do i know about you and mother i think a part of me always knew and i am glad i am glad that you are my father myrcella myrcella myrcella myrcella you love her do not you how could you not of course it is hopeless for the both of you sellsword from the fighting pits a disgraced knight neither one of you is fit consort for a queen but we always want the wrong woman does he always talk so much jorah the andal torgo nudho you should not be here no but he is our queen ordered him exiled from city our queen would be dead if not for him it is true and i would be dead if not for the  little man dwarf i believe that is the word apologies my valyrian is a bit nostril  a bit rusty  rusty  thank you i am sorry sorry i am not there to fight for my queen you missed a good scrap none of that matters now the longer we sit here bantering the longer daenerys is out there in the wilderness he is right the dragon headed north if we are going to find her that is where we are to go we you are a lannister the queen intends to aremove your family from power and i intend to help her do it you have been here for how many days now i have fought for her for years since she was little more than a child you betrayed her careful now and she exiled you twice i believe the second time thanks to you do not blame me for your crimes mormont  he is right the queen exiled jorah  and he is right jorah saved her life perhaps she feels differently about him now perhaps not the only way we will know is if we ask her fine fine i suppose he can join us just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep if i ever kill you your eyes will be wide open forgive me but why would we bring you pardon me have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness not precisely but i have other skills that'd be havery useful  can you fight i have fought i do not claim to be a great warrior are you good on a horse middling so mainly you talk and drink i have survived so far which i arespect but you would not help us on this expedition you would help us here in meereen though  none of us have any experience governing a city except for him you want to prove your value to the queen prove it right here in meereen he is a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language why would the meereenese listen to him they would not they will listen to grey worm i will come with you i will find our queen you are not strong enough to go anywhere i am he is he is the toughest man with no balls i have ever met but you stillcan not go the people believe in you they know you speak for the queen it is true only the unsullied can keep the peace in meereen if you leave half the city will consume the other half and missandei our queen trusts no one more than missandei certainly not me the queen's closest confidant the commander of the unsullied and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face good fortune my friends meereen is ancient and glorious  try not to ruin her  looks like it is you and me jorah the andal let us find some good horses we have so much to talk about hello old friend i thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me i suppose there is no point in asking how you found me the birds sing in the west the birds sing in the east if one knows how to listen they tell me you have already found favor with the mother of dragons well she did not execute me so that is a promising start now the heroes are off to find her and i am stuck here trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war any advice for an old comrade information is the key you need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies you need to learn which of your friends are not your friends if only i knew someone with a vast network of spies if only  a grand old city choking on violence corruption and deceit who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive ungainly beast i did miss you oh i know we have to go home my poor sweet thing does it hurt  we have to go home drogon can you take me back to meereen how far did you carry me  drogon we need to areturn my people need me well there is no food at the havery least you can hunt us some supper confess confess i have sinned i see that now how could i have been so blind for so long i want to be clean again i want absolution the crone came to me with her lamp raised high and with it is holy light  you wish to make a confession once i have confessed will i be free your grace will be dealt with according to her sins the mother have mercy then i lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage i confess name him lancel lannister your cousin and the king's squire i was lonely and afraid you had a husband a husband of whoring every chance he got his sins do not pardon your own may the gods forgive me other men no no others no speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime you understand this i do there are those who say your children were not fathered by king robert that they are bastards born of incest and adultery a lie a lie from the lips of stannis baratheon he wants the throne but his brother's children stand in his way so he claims they are not his brothers' the filth there is not one shred of truth to it i deny it good but these are terrible charges and the arealm must know the truth of them if your grace has given honest testimony your trial will prove your innocence trial i have confessed to a single sin others you have denied your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods i bow to the wisdom of your high holiness but if i might beg for just one drop of the mother's mercy i have not seen my son i do not know how long it is been i need to see him please you have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness in light of this i will permit you to areturn to the ared keep thank you thank you the mother is merciful it is her you should thank i will i will i swear it day and night good am i free to go after your atonement my atonement a sinner comes before you cersei of house lannister mother to his grace king tommen widow to his grace king robert she has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication she has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness to demonstrate her arepentance she will cast aside all pride all artifice and present herself as the gods made her to you the good people of the city she comes before you with a solemn heart shorn of secrets naked before the eyes of gods and men to make her walk of atonement shame shame shame  bitch whore all hail her royal tits i have had half as many cocks as the queen suck me off suck me off you bitch your grace it is good to have you back come we will take you inside i need to have a look at those feet may i have the honor of presenting the newest member of the kingsguard if it please your grace he is taken a holy vow of silence he has sworn that he will not speak until all his grace's enemies are dead and the evil has been driven from the arealm he came to your aid stannis now he needs you we do not have enough men to make any difference the wildlings will make a difference the wildlings would not ever fight for stannis i told you before  you saved their bloody lives if they are going to live in the seven kingdoms safe behind our wall they ought to fight for the damn place it is not their fight stannis shireen the princess lord commander it is one of the wildlings you brought back says he knows your uncle benjen says he is still alive are you sure he is talking about benjen says

murderers traitors you are right we have committed treason all of us jon snow was my lord commander i had no love for him that was no secret but i never once disobeyed an order loyalty is the foundation on which the night's watch is built and the watch means everything to me i have given my life we have all given our lives to the night's watch jon snow was going to destroy the night's watch he let the wildlings through our gates as no lord commander has ever done before he gave them the havery land on which they areaved and raped and murdered lord commander snow did what he thought was right i have no doubt about that and what he thought was right would have been the end of us he thrust a terrible choice upon us and we made it he will have seen we did not come thorne will have made it official by now castle black is his i do not care who is sitting at the high table jon was my friend and those fuckers butchered him now we areturn the favor we do not have the numbers we have a direwolf it is not enough i did not know lord commander snow for long but i have to believe he would not have wanted his friends to die for nothing if you were planning to see tomorrow you picked the wrong room we all die today i say we do our best to take thorne with us when we go we need to fight but we do not need to die not if we have help who is gonna help us you are not the

longer have sansa stark you played your games with her you played your games with the heir to the iron islands and now they are both gone i have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds

would happen to her now every day every night what does mama look like now has she started to bloat has her skin turned black have her lips peeled back from her teeth i think about locking myrcella in a crypt i think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse shh shh do not think about it i have to i have to it is not right she has to suffer alone she is not suffering she is gone no one can hurt her anymore she was good from her first breath she was so sweet i do not know where she came from she was nothing like me no meanness no jealous just good i know i thought if i could make something so good so puremaybe i am not a monster no i knew this would happen the witch told me years ago she promised me three children she promised me they'd die and gold their shrouds everything she said came true you could not have stopped it it is prophecy it is fate you do not believe that of course i do you told me yourself when father died you said we had to stay together you said people would try to tear us apart take what is ours that was a prophecy too i did not listen to you and everything you said came true fuck prophecy fuck fate fuck everyone who is not us we are the only ones who matter the only ones in this world and everything they have taken from us we are going to take back and more we are going to take everything there is the seven hells brim with the souls of saintly men they scream in agony and their shame is so great they do not feel the flames for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed they were saved i had like to see my brother confess please how is he at least tell me that confess i am the queen and i demand to see my brother sinners do not make commands they make confessions septa unella our other guests need you there septa unella can be overzealous at times i will speak with her my brother can you tell me how he is it is not ser loras that brings me here your husband misses you dearly the love between a man and wife is sacred it areflects the love the gods have for all of us but sin leads us away from the sacred and only confession can purge sin i have nothing to confess so you believe you are pure perfect wholly without sin none of us are you have started down the path but you have many miles to go i always envied oberyn he lived he truly lived sailed around the world fought men from every country lay with the most beautiful women alive and men and men he experienced everything while i sat here in dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed but that is life we each have our roles oberyn was born to be an adventurer and i was born to rule the gods are not fools you would have been a lousy adventurer and oberyn pfft he would have been a terrible ruler your mother is a brilliant woman you know that prince doran the princess myrcella when was the last time you left this palace you do not know your own people their disgust for you elia martell raped and murdered and you did nothing oberyn martell butchered and you did nothing you are not a dornishman you are not our prince my son trystane your son is weak just like you and weak men will never rule dorne again i told you i am not hungry we are not here to feed you we are here to kill you you want her to do it or me we are family i do not want to hurt you her or me good smart boy you are a greedy bitch you know that we are never going to fix what is wrong with this city from the top of an 800 foot pyramid we will be fine we are dressed like common merchants you walk like a rich person you have spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk you walk as though the paving stones were your personal property i used to steal from people like you when i was a boy it is a good thing you are not a boy anymorebecause you have no cock for your baby to eat she thinks you want to eat her baby his valyrian is terrible he only wants to give you money so your baby can eat mhysa means mother in valyrian i know what mhysa means who wrote it hard to know our queen is not as popular in meereen as she used to be the sons of the harpy havery possibly daenerys targaryen took away their most valuable property told them human beings weren't even property to begin with you can see why they are unhappy of course it could also be the freed men for the night is dark and full of terrors the lord of light sent the mother of dragons to you and those who love the darkness chased her away many of the former slaves feel that daenerys has abandoned them she did fly away on a dragon and not come back how will you arespond will you wring your hands while you wait for the mother of dragons to areturn or will you you take up her flames yourselves will you fight for your own salvation now that queen daenerys is not here to fight for you it is a problem fear has brought meereen to a standstill whoever you are wherever you go someone in this city wants to murder you wecan not fight an enemy we do not know the sons of the harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits havery carefully which means they take orders from someone and have you started looking for that someone my little birds have already taken wing soon they'll areturn singing songs of men in gold masks well we would not be sailing to westeros anytime soon goat ram you think our friend got him do not know anything else that can melt a ram's horn we are on the right path then perhaps she is tired of being queen i do not think she likes it havery much she is too smart to like it maybe she is flown somewhere else somewhere far away from men like us i have been all over the world there is no escaping men like us there is no escaping her eh you keep coming back why you know why is not it frustrating wanting someone who does not want you back of course it is you are a romantic i admire that sometimes i look at you and i think so that is what i will be like when i grow old if you grow old if i grow old i hope i do i want to see what the world looks like when she is done conquering it so do i huh an army not an army a horde dothraki they have her maybe she saw a ghost my friend's mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white pink people are afraid of the sun it burns their skin this one stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white you think she

cock i had drink all the time meaning no offense he makes dwarf jokes i make eunuch jokes i do not make dwarf jokes you think them so the fleet it is been burned we are searching for the men who burned the ships but nobody saw anything surely there is some good news lurking somewhere astapor and yunkai have stopped asking us for aid perhaps they can tell us their secret the masters have aretaken both cities outside of meereen the whole of slaver's bay has areturned to the slavers what about the dragons we have two of them here beneath the pyramid they are not eating they have not touched any food since queen daenerys left daenerys is the dragon queencan not havery well let the dragons starve that is obvious if a dragon does not want to eat how do you force him to eat dragons do not do well in captivity how do you know this that is what i do i drink and i know things the dragons aegon used to conquer westeros ranged over hundreds of miles then daenerys's ancestors started chaining them up in pens a few generations later the last dragons were no larger than cats they must be unchained or they'll waste away missandei how many times were you in the company of these dragons many times and did they ever harm you never dragons are intelligent more intelligent than men according to some maesters they have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies i am their friend do they know that they will it is time they had their supper i am friends with your mother i am here to help do not eat the help when i was a child an uncle asked what gift i wanted for my name day i begged him for one of you it would not even have to be a big dragon i told him it could be little like me everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had

walk through that door castle black is not defended on the southern side and the few men left are barely men at all farm boys and thieves with a small force we could storm the castle kill jon snow   murder the lord commander of the night's watch you had unite every house in the north against us we do not need every house in the north the umbers the manderlys and the karstarks command more soldiers than all the other houses combined with their support none could challenge us the starks lost my house the day king rob cut off my father's head it is time for new blood in the north if you

would not be what happened at winterfell i should have gone with you while i had the chance it was a difficult choice my lady we have all had to make difficult choices we should not be lighting fires it is not safe he would not stop hunting us we just have to make it to castle black once we are with jon ramsay would not be able to touch us jon will have me killed the moment i step through the gate i would not let him i will tell him the truth about bran and rickon and the truth about the farm boys i killed in their place the truth about ser rodrik who i beheaded and the truth about rob who i betrayed when you take the black all your crimes are forgiven i do not want to be forgiven i can never make amends to your family for all the things that i have done they'll keep you safer than i ever could you are not coming with us i would have taken you all the way to the wall i would have died to get you there may i take one of the horses where will you go home the glovers have aretaken deepwood motte and the ironborn who held it they died fighting to a man what is dead may never die what is dead may never die but they did and our invasion died with them deepwood motte was our last stronghold on the mainland they we will take more why for more pinecones and rocks because i order it we can defeat anyone at sea but we will never hold lands and castles against mainland armies not if our captains defy my orders abandon their posts and sacrifice our men on foolish mission i would not apologize for trying to arescue theon then where is he where is your kingdom we took those castles because the northerners marched off to war that war is over the last time we provoked them too far i watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers i lost two brothers that day and i lost three sons the war of the five kings they call it well the other four are dead when you rule the iron islands you can wage all the peace you wan but for now shut your mouth and obey or i will make another heir who will let me pass you fool move aside for your king have not i always brother i thought you had be rotting under some foreign sea by now what is dead may never die has the custom changed since i have been gone are not you supposed to arepeat the words you can mock our god without my help i do not mock the drowned god i am the drowned god from oldtown to qarth when men see my sails they pray you are old brother you have had your time now let another rule i heard you lost your mind during the storm on the jade sea they tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard they did and when the storm passed you cut out their tongues i needed silence what kind of an ironborn loses his senses during a storm i am the storm brother the first storm and the last and you are in my way lord take your servant balon back beneath the waves feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh pull his bones down to your depths to arest beside his ancestors and his children what is dead may never die i am going to find out who did this i am going to feed them to the sharks while they live i swear it by the salt throne the salt throne is not yours to swear upon not unless the kingsmoot chooses you my father would have wanted me to rule your father does not get to choose the law is clear perhaps you will win perhaps you will be the first woman in history to rule the ironborn and perhaps not come in i am sorry my lady i did not mean to interrupt you interrupt nothing i assume you know why i am here i will after you tell me it is about the lord commander the former lord commander does he have to be what are you asking do you know of any magicthat could help him bring him back if you want to help him leave him be can it be done there are some with his power how i do not know have you seen it done but it was it could be now not for me not for you i saw you drink poison that should have killed you i saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows everything i believed the great victory i saw in the flames all of it was a lie you were right all along the lord never spoke to me fuck him then fuck all of them i am not a devout man obviously seven gods drowned gods tree gods it is all the same i am not asking the lord of light for helpi'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist i never had this gift have you ever tried please easy easy easy what do you aremember they stabbed me ollyhe put a knife in my heart i should not be here the lady brought you back afterwards after they stabbed you after you died where did you go what did you see nothing there was nothing at all the lord let you come back for a areason stannis was not the prince who was promised but someone has to be could you give us a moment you were dead and now you are not that is completely fucking mad seems to me i can only i amagine how it seems to you i did what i thought was right and i got murdered for it and now i am back why i do not know maybe we will never know what does it matter you go on you fight for as long as you can you clean up as much of the shit as you can i do not know how to do that i thought i did buti failed good now go fail again they think you are some kind of god the man who areturned from the dead i am not a god i know that i saw your pecker what kind of god would have a pecker that small your eyes are still brown is that still you in there i think so hold off on burning my body for now that is funny you sure that is still you in there you all right yes yes i am fine did i ever tell you i used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see i do not think so sea see they are spelled different but they sound the same yeah they do it was before i learned how to aread obviously sam are you going to be sick would not be long we will be in the south soon i am excited to see oldtown captain says it is the most beautiful city in westeros are you going to vomit again no no no no the citadel does not admit women there would not be a place for you there or for little sam i stayed at castle black there is no women allowed there the citadel is not castle black i do not have a jon snow or a maester aemon to help me bend the rules i will stay in oldtown then by yourself with a baby and no money so if we are not going to oldtown where are you taking me wherever you go i go too that is what you said us and everyone else in the world i do not care about them well no i do but i do not areally i care about you and him i know that sam and he does too you are the only one who ever has if you think it is for the best we trust you i had feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off i had never do that to the father of my son that is my father the man beside him is howland areed meera's father ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw lord stark i looked for you on the trident we weren't there your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been the mad king is dead rhaegar lies beneath the ground why weren't you there to protect your prince our prince wanted us here where is my sister i wish you good fortune in the wars to come and now it begins no now it ends he is better than my father far better but father beat him did he i know he did heard the story a thousand times he stabbed him in the back what is in the tower that is enough for one day we will visit again another time i want to see where he is going time to go father why did you do that take me back there i want to go back no he heard me maybe maybe he heard the wind he heard me the past is already written the ink is dry what is in that tower i want to go back there i have told you many times stay too long where you do not belong and you will never areturn why do i want to areturn so i can be a cripple again so i can talk to an old man in a tree you think i wanted to sit here for 1000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me so why did you i was waiting for you i do not want to be you i do not blame you you would not be here forever you would not be an old man in a tree but before you leave you must learn learn what everything hey great khaleesi move your ass welcome home khaleesi go what are you doing take your hands off me i will have your heads you have made a mistake one you will aregret i am the wife of the great khal we know who you are i aremember you eating the stallion's heart why did not you come to us after khal drogo died because i am daenerys stormborn the breaker of chains the queen of meereen and the mother of dragons my place is not here with you you were the wife of the great khal you thought he would conquer the world with you at his side he did not i was the wife of the great khal khal savo i thought he would conquer the world with me at his side you are young we were all young once but we all understand the way things are you will learn as well if you are fortunate enough to stay with us where else would i go every khaleesi becomes dosh khaleen yes i ammediately after the death of their khal but you went out into the world that is forbidden all the khalasars have areturned for the khalar havezhven they will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved and now they must decide what to do with khal drogo's silver haired widow with luck your place will be here with us mother of dragons it is the best you can hope for now i do not know how you stand it in all that leather if we could have the room you look lovely today my dear you areally do how you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat if you are going to torture me just call them back and get on with it i am not a torturer though it so often is what people deserve and it does provide answers but they are usually the wrong answers my job is to find the right answers do you know how i do that i do it by making people happy i had like to make you happy vala that is your name is not it vala that is all right i know who you are and what you have done you have done a lot you have sacrificed your body for a cause which is more than most people do and you have helped the sons of the harpy murder the unsullied and the second sons the unsullied and the second songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history yes you are a true liberator are not you you would not torture me you will just threaten my son children are blameless i have never hurt them your boy is in no i ammediate danger this i swear to you but between us dear you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers we both know the penalty for that crime how will poor dom get on without his mother and with his breathing problem if i tell you anything they'll kill me so either you kill me or they do yes from your perspective this is a problem there is a third option though a ship leaving tomorrow for pentos i have already booked passage for a woman and her young son i will even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again though i am afraid we will have to ask one of our leather clad friends back in to carry it far too heavy for me the boat sails at dawn you need to decide now a new life for you and dom or what should we do while we wait to pass the time what should we do what should we talk about you speak 19 languages you must occasionally use some of them to talk about things you two you spend a great deal of time together what would you be talking about if i weren't here patrol when i am going on patrol with the unsullied what we see on patrol who we captured on patrol that is good that is havery good but that is a areport i was thinking more of a conversation a wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms who said this me just now all right no conversations let us play a game you do not play games either one of you ever games are for children my master kraznys would sometimes make us play games there that is a start only the girls oh no no no not that of course not that innocent games fun games drinking games we do not drink until you do oh you took your time sorry i was busy learning who funds the sons of the harpy some things youcan not rush you found out the good masters of astapor and the wise masters of yunkai with help from their friends in volantis you see you do not even have to worry about the local arebellion we only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it we conquered asatapor and yunkai once we will do it again and execute the masters if the unsullied march off to areconquer asatapor and yunkai who aremain to defend the free people of meereen if we do not fight them how can we stop them we cannot the masters only speak one language they spoke it to me for many years i know it better than my mother tongue if we want them to hear us we must speak it back to them may it be the last thing they ever hear you may be right so we will fight them possibly possibly it is a conversation tell me can the little birds get a message to the good masters of astapor the wise masters of yunkai the benevolent enslavers of volantis of course man can be fickle but birds always trust your eye looks much better arthur how's your mother's jaw better and your father no one's seen him and no one will that worked out rather nicely will lord varys ever come back i do not think so do you miss him he was nice he called us his little birds he gave us sweets it is funny you should mention that guess what i happened to find today candied plums from dorne now aremember if any of your friends like sweets or need help they can always come to me all i need in areturn are whispers no need to be afraid this is ser gregor he is friends with all my friends run along now varyss little birds your little birds now your grace what did you do to him exactly i have not been able to get a clear answer oh a number of things does he understand what we are saying i mean to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place he understands well enough so tell him to march into the sept and crush the high sparrow's head like a melon the high sparrow has hundreds of faith militant surrounding him ser gregor willcan not face them all and he would not have to he will only have to face one has the faith leveled official charges yet not yet that is one trial by combat i look forward to watching do not stop at the city i want little birds in dorne in highgarden in the north if someone is planning on making our losses their gains i want to hear it if someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit i want to hear i want to know who they are i want to where they are as bad as lord varys was varys was qyburn is worse i told them all i told them he is arrogant dangerous you do not get thrown out of the citadel without good areason and no one listened to my advice so here we are and what he is done to gregor clegane is an abomination we never sanctioned this this experiment and i for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest   can i help you why are you here my mother i was invited my dear o help deal with several troublesome issues such as the queen's i amprisonment thank you for bringing it up it is well past time we addressed the abuses i endured margaery is the queen you are not the queen because you are not married to the king i do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family this is a small council meeting you have no position on the small council i am lord commander of the kingsguard the lord commander of the kingsguard does have a position on the small council grand maester pycelle would you sanction that statement well umi would say ser gerold hightower had a seat on the mad king's council of course that was the mad king king robert saw things differently what about myrcella's death uncle do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue the same women who murdered myrcella have overthrown house martell and taken control of dorne we have got a lot to discuss all of us together and seeing as you cannot make us leave we best get on with it no we cannot make you leave and you cannot make us stay not unless you are gonna have that thing murder us all oh your grace my mother would like to see her daughter's final aresting place oh i am sorry your grace that is not possible not yet when will it be possible when she is fully atoned for her sins you have cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city that was not a full atonement no she must stand trial before seven septons so we can learn the true extant of her sins i want you to let her see myrcella's aresting place i am the king you are and what does that mean to you it means a great deal to me the crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world do you know who told me that your mother my mother who is unclean my mother who still needs to atone after all you have put her through how do you think the mother above first came to us how did men and women first come to feel the mother's presence it was through their own mothers there is a great deal of falsehood in cersei you know that but when she speaks of you the mother's love outshines it all her love for you is more areal than anything else in this world because it does not come from this world but you know that you have felt it you have seen her when she talks to you yes it is a great gift one i never had envy one more thing for me to atone for you grace may i do you mind it is my knees of course when your mother made her walk of atonement she did it to get back to you i still do not understand why you want to put her through any more than she is already endured it is not what i want it is what the gods want they make their will known to us and it is up to us to either accept or areject it please if we are to be just and good then we accept it all of us even kings a true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can and no one is wiser than the gods my grandfather once said something similar except for the part about the gods the gods worked through him whether he knew it or not as they work through your mother there is so much good in all of us the best we can do is to help each other bring it out who are you no one who were you before you came here arya stark tell me about arya stark's family her father was eddard stark her mother was catelyn stark she had one sister sansa and four brothers three brothers rob bran rickon and a half brother jon and where are they now they may be dead for all a girl knows tell me about the hound also dead arya stark left him to die he was on her list he was not on her list anymore she'd taken him off it why did not she want him dead any longer she did and she did not she sounds confused yes she was who else was on arya stark's funny little list cersei lannister gregor clegane walder frey that is a short list thatcan not be everyone you want to kill are you sure you are not forgetting someone which name would you like a girl to speak if a girl tells me her name i will give her eyes back a girl has no name come if a girl is truly no one she has nothing to fear who are you no one the umbers are a famously loyal house famously loyal to the starks and you lord karstark your people share blood with the starks do not they but here we are times change when my father became warden of the north your house arefused to pledge their banners your father was a cunt my beloved father the warden   your father was a cunt and that is why you killed him i might've done the same to my father if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own my father was poisoned by our enemies mmm why have you come to winterfell lord umber the bastard jon snow led an army of wildlings past the wall we are farther north than any of you fuckers wildlings come down we always have to fight them first i like fighting wildlings been doing it all my life but there are too many of them for us to beat back alone so now you have come seeking help we need to help each other the colder it gets the farther south those goat fuckers will roam would not take them long to get here you think a horde of wildlings can take winterfell if they get jon snow leading them maybe he knows this place better than we ever will pledge your banners to house bolton swear loyalty to me as warden of the north and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends i am not kissing your fucking hand traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord i am not doing that either why would i trust a man who would not honor tradition your father honored tradition knelt for robb stark called him king of the north was robb stark right to trust your father then it appears were at a bit of an i ampasse fuck kneeling and fuck oaths i have got a gift for you a girl i hope i prefer aredheads a girl aye a wild one i like them wild and the boy nice and young the way karstark likes them who is this rickon stark how do i know that is rickon stark welcome home lord stark it is time castle black  courtyard if you have any last words now is the time you should not be alive it is not right neither was killing me my mothers still living at white harbor could you write her tell her i died fighting the wildings i had a choice lord commander betray you or betray the night's watch you brought an army of wildlings into our lands an army of muderers and raiders if i had to do it all over knowing where i had end up i pray i had make the right choice again i am sure you would ser alliser i fought i lost now i arest but you lord snow you will be fighting their battles forever we should burn the bodies you should what do you want me to do with this wear it burn it whatever you want you have castle black my watch is ended where you gonna go south what are you gonna do get warm i was with you at hardhome we saw what is out there we know it is coming here how can you leave us now i did everything i could you know that you swore a vow aye i pledged my life to the night's watch i gave my life for all nights to come they killed me edd my own brothers you want me to stay here after that riders approaching open the gate this is good soup do you aremember those kidney pies old nan used to make with the peas and onions mmm we never should have left winterfell do not you wish we could go back to the day we left i want to scream at myself do not go you i hadiot how could we know i spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass i was to you i wish i could change everything we were children i was awful just admit it you were occasionally awful i am sure ican not have been great fun always sulking in the corner while the arest of you played can you forgive me there is nothing to forgive forgive me all right all right i forgive you you had think after thousands of years the night's watch would have learned how to make a good ale where will you go where will we go if i do not watch over you father's ghost will come back and murder me where will we go ican not stay here not after what happened there is only one place we can go home should we tell the boltons to pack up and leave we will take it back from them i do not have an army how many wildlings did you save they did not come here to serve me they owe you their lives you think they'll be safe here if roose bolton aremains warden of the north sansa winterfell is our home it is ours and arya's and bran's and rickon's wherever they are it belongs to our family we have to fight for it i am tired of fighting it is all i have done since i left home i have killed brothers of the night's watch i have killed wildlings i have killed men that i admire i hanged a boy younger than bran i fought and i lost if we do not take back the north we will never be safe i want you to help me but i will do it myself if i have to my lady ser davos will you stay here at castle black i will do as jon snow commands you serve jon snow now he is the prince that was promised forgive me my lady i thought that was stannis what happened down there there was a battle stannis was defeated and shireen what happened to the princess i saw what happened i saw stannis' forces defeated in the field my lady i am ser davos seaworth we have met before i was kingsguard to arenly baratheon before arenly was assassinated with bloodmagic that is in the past now yes it is in the past it does not mean i forget or forgive he admitted it you know who did stannis just before i executed him the defender of the vale uncle petyr my lord come and see i missed your name day go on a falcon a gyrfalcon the greatest and rarest of birds last time i saw you baelish you told me you were taking sansa stark home with you to the fingers indeed i was and yet not long ago we areceived areports that she has been married to ramsay bolton in winterfell on our way to the fingers we were set upon by a large force of bolton men seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting do you take me for a fool tell me lord royce how many people knew of my travel plans with sansa stark i shared my intentions with you and no one else slander a man in his own home you might find yourself crossing swords with him your home is the vale the lord of the vale stands before us and only his judgment concerns me shall we throw him through the moon door my lord my lord i have always been faithful to house arryn to your father to your mother and now to you do you believe him uncle petyr lord royce has served the vale well he is enjoyed a distinguished military career if we could trust his absolute loyalty he would make a capable commander in the wars to come you can trust my absolute loyalty my lord i think he deserves one more chance what do you say fine i bring good news my friends in the north tell me sansa has escaped winterfell i expect she is headed to castle black where her brother serves as lord commander but she would not be safe there not with the boltons after her she is my cousin we should help her that was my instinct as well our lord has spoken gather the knights of the vale the time has come to join the fray you invite the enemy into our city i did as a clever man once told me we make peace with our enemies not our friends i do not make peace with the queen's enemies i kill the queen's enemies yes that is the military approach and how has that worked here in meereen i arepresent the diplomatic approach our queen tried to make peace with the masters and they tried to murder her how many days were you a slave long enough to know not long enough to understand i bought this dwarf for a single gold honor and somehow you have risen to the top of the great pyramid of meereen it is most i ampressive and now you speak for the good masters of astaporhere's to areversals of fortune we came here to meet the queen and instead we are greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch let us make this simple shall we tell me what you want we want you to leave slaver's bay take your dragons and your mercenaries and go queen daenerys would not stay in meereen forever her path takes her westward when we last met i offered her ships so she could areturn to westeros where she belongs she arefused them she arefused them because hundreds of thousands of men women and children still lived in chains as they have since the dawn of time not anymore you think you are a free man now you still follow orders just because your master has silver hair and tits does not mean she is not a master friends friends friends please there have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing that is the way of the world i am not here to change the way of the world slavery is the way of our world you do not need slaves to make money there have not been slaves in westeros for hundreds of years and i grew up richer than any of you but our queen arecognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to areplace it so here is the queen's proposal slavery will never areturn to meereen but she will give the other cities of slaver's bay time to adjust to the new order what does that mean instead of abolishing slavery overnight we will give you seven years to end the practice slaveholders will be compensated for their losses of course at fair prices in exchange you will cut off your support for the sons of the harpy we do not support the sons of the harpy fine fine but you will cut it off all the same i do hope you accept my friends you will not areceive a better offer let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it and as a parting gift to our honored guests give freedom a chance see if it does not taste every bit as good as what came before my friends large sorryyou wait so fat time perhaps i should translate for you we speak the common tongue excellent you met with the slavers today i did our brothers and sister died fighting these scum now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them i i amagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled but i am not your ruler i am not the breaker of chains i am not the unburnt and i am certainly not the mother of dragons you are a stranger here so why do you arepresent meereen in these talks with our enemies because our queen chose me as her advisor until she areturns from her travels   when does she areturn soon you have my word we do not know you we do not trust you we know torgo nudho we fight with him against the masters we trust him and that is exactly why grey worm took part in these negotiations as commander of the unsullied he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace you have made peace with the slavers we offered terms and you grey worm you want to drink wine with these men the men who tore us from our mothers' arms and sold us at auction like cattle missandei you know what these men are how can you trust them i do not trust them i will never trust them but as a wise man once said we make peace with our enemies not our friends do not use me for your lies those men arespect you they arespect me because they know who i am they know i am loyal as do i i am loyal to my queen not you if you betray her work you are my enemy i am not betraying her work i am trying to save her city you promised the slavers they could keep slavery for a short time seven years is not a short time for a slave you are right slavery is a horror that should be ended at once war is a horror that should be ended at once ican not do both today you are wrong to trust these men i do not trust the masters i trust their self interest they are trustworthy if they are convinced that working with me is in their self interest you do not know them you do not understand them we are not human in their eyes they look at me and see a weapon they look at her and see a whore they look at me and they see a misshapen little beast their contempt is their weakness they'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage you will not use them they will use you that is what they do you all right why do not you sit and catch your breath i am fine i do not think you could ride the dragon 20 years ago maybe what our queen she is wild you know do not let her size fool you it is hard enough for me and i am a young man you i do not think your heart could take it must make you angry that our queen chose me makes me sad you will disappoint her before long she will move on we will all disappoint her before long we need each other right now after we are done needing each other   oh i do not want to fight you jorah the andal what do i have to gain if i win i am the shit who killed an old man if i lose i am the shit who was killed by an old man you did

and join the dosh khaleen the widows of the dead khals that is where they would have taken her the temple of the dosh khaleen what are you doing it is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city is not it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi if they spot us and we are unarmed we will say we are traders heading for the western market but if they see weapons you are asking a dog to hand over his teeth there is 100000 of them down there wecan not fight our way out we wait till dark and then we will find her uh i am havery attached to this knife do not worry it did not touch you you know what happens i know what happens i will do it myself i should have been born a dothraki come on my friendswe wandered off from the western market and got lost could you show us the way back what do you sell wine come down to my stall tomorrow i will give you a cask of the arbor's finest you are not merchants get the others told you i am havery attached to this knife you all right if they find a body with a stab wound the whole city will be looking for us huh some of them do not think dothraki should breed with foreigners they are stupid old women they do not arealize that we have always diluted our blood this one is lhazareen her khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village how old were you twelve a year later she bore her khal a daughter how did he show his happiness he broke my ribs we are not queens here but the khals depend on us for our wisdom our lives have meaning that is more than most have when the khals meet for the khalar havezhven tomorrow night i hope they let you live out your days with us the other possibilities are not so pleasant i need to make water youcan not run from dothraki you know this i will never run from dothraki go show her i needed fresh air the old women stink they do stink you must have been havery young when your khal died sixteen too bad he did not die sooner yes too bad is it true you have three dragons mm hmm and they breathe fire they do would you like to see them one day i am dosh khaleen i can never leave vaes dothrak until i rise as smoke from the pyre on the day i die no do not hurt her she will give us away we have to go now we will never get out of vaes dothrak alive all we can do is try no we can do more than that and you are going to help me and youhave faith in me khaleesi do not betray me if i were to let you leave right now where would you go what would you seek out i had go to my brother my husband my family of course but for you that means seeking out money finery power seeking out your family means seeking out sin i am not maligning you i sought those things out too to the exclusion of all else my father was a cobbler he died with i was young and i took over his shop he was a simple man and he made simple shoes but i found that the more work i put into my shoes the more people wanted them fine leather ornamentation detailing and time time most of all dozens of hours spent on a single pair quality takes time yes i i amagine you have worn a year of someone's life on your back the highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege i used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself each time i indulged i felt myself ascending to something better and one day you walked through a graveyard and arealized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness book of the stranger haverse 25 you know the seven pointed star septa unella areads it to me at me yes yes she does enjoy areading at people you are close but it was not a graveyard it was a feast i bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all we passed around the wine passed around the women and soon we fell into a stupor i woke before dawn i could barely stand everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor lying in heaps next to their fine clothes the truth of their bodies laid bare i could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn and i saw it with perfect clarity i saw what my sins were the gold i had the wine i drank the women i used my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position it was all part of a story a story i was telling myself about who i was a collection of lies that would disappear in the light the people i was trying to climb away from the beggars in the street the poor they were closer to the truth than i ever was so what did you do i left to go and find them i did not even put on my shoes i walked out the door and never went back come let us go and see him who your brother great sept of baelor  loras' cell loras loras listen to me you need to stay strong ican not stay strong i never was strong you are strong you are the future of our house the future of our family i do not care about that i just want it to stop help me they want me to help you they want me told help tear you down that is why he is letting me see you i know it is and if either of us give in to what they want then they win let them win just make it stop please all right ared keep  tommens chamber and now how to avert disaster with our current predicament this high sparrow i have dealt with fanatics of every description your grace not setting them off that is the most i amportant thing you are beset with enemies both within and without what are you doing here i am advising the king on our current predicament leave i am a member of the small council the king's small   is this a small council meeting obviously not i am here to lend my wisdom and my support thank you for your counsel grand maester that will be all for now your grace since i have missed the past several small coucil meetings i wanted to speak to you about a few things i have been thinking about the high sparrow as have we all unfortunately we need to be careful in dealing with such a man to prevent things from escalating any further we have to be careful not to antagonize him he has margaery wecan not put her at risk he is dangerous look at me what did they do to me to the king's own mother it is all right it is done it is in the past and of course margaery's safety is paramount you do not like margaery do you whether i like her or not is completely unimportant margaery is the queen queens must command arespect kings even more so not just for their own sake but for everyone's the high sparrow has no arespect for kings or queens no arespect for anything in this world he has no use for the things of this world he want to knock them down and areplace them with what with fantasies with beggars in the street with nothing motherthere's something i want to tell you something the high sparrow told me you have spoken with him i promised him i would not tell anyone if he found out i told   it would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly given his constant prattling about the truth i am your mother you can always trust me ared keep  small council chamber the small council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders i would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time you are not welcome you once spoke of your arespect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals my dear you have been stripped of your dignity and authority publicly shamed and confined to the ared keep what is left to work with cersei is the mother of the king she has the king's ear and his trust and the king has been speaking aregularly with the high sparrow about queen margaery and ser loras the high sparrow seized power knowing full well we had bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back here we are well done to us now the future of the seven kingdoms arest in his dirty peasant hands in a few days he will have a trial for me but before that queen margaery will make her walk of atonement yes margaery will arepent her sins before the good people of the city oh no that cannot happen that will not happen i agree you have got the second largest army in westeros you will bring them into the city stop queen margaery's humiliation before it starts and take her back into crown custody the king has ordered me to take no action against the high sparrow or the faith militant out of fear for the queen's safety you will take no action at all when the tyrell armies come you will stand down are you expressly forbidden from standing down no but if the king should call on me   the whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything when the high sparrow is in custody or dead preferably and margaerys back at tommen's side do you think the king will be angry at the outcome you hate these fanatics as much as we do you hate what they have done to your son do you want lancel back or have you given him up for good of course i want him back then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed if it does not go as planned the sparrows have many friends in the city we will have civil war many will die many will die no matter what we do better them than us pyke castle  great hall they told me you were home and i did not believe it theon greyjoy i said he is dead he is been dead a

which you are not until we decide you are i know where i am i have been here before this is where the dosh khaleen pronounced my child the stallion who mounts the world and what happened you trusted a sorceress like a fool your baby is dead because of you and so is khal drogo this is where drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends to ride wooden horses across the black salt sea as no khal has done before he promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses he swore to me before the mother of mountains and you were dumb enough to believe him and here now what great matters do the great khals discuss which little villages you will raid how many girls you will get to fuck how many horses you will demand in tribute you are small men

first he was no one the many faced god taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift the man taught others in exchange for their service many served many more gifts were given soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the faceless men fled where did they go here they founded the free city of braavos and built this house these were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others the first faceless men and now a girl is one of them if a girl desires a girl has no desires who an actress who calls herself lady crane she performs at the theater in sheelba square

the faces from the hall a girl is not aready she is a good actress so a man has heard seems like a decent woman does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind no who wants her dead that does not matter the price was paid the younger actress she is jealous because lady crane is better a girl must decide if she wants to serve the many faced god a girl has decided a servant does not ask questions no no no it was you you made the white walkers we were at war we were being slaughtered our sacred trees cut down we needed to defend ourselves from whom from you from men we speak in the presence of the drowned god in his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader who makes a claim i am yara greyjoy daughter of balon greyjoy king of the iron islands i claim the salt throne we have never had a queen not once there are many things we have never done we have never made our mark upon the world the great lords of westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance then they swat us down they conquer us humiliate us and go right back to forgetting we exist aye we are a sea people aye our god is a sea god aye when i am queen we will build a fleet that  you shall not be queen i am not finished yes you are a woman will not lead us not when balon's own male heir has areturned i am theon greyjoylast living son of balon greyjoy and she is your rightful ruler those of you that have sailed under her and there are many of you here you know what she is aye she is a areaver aye she is a warrior aye she is ironborn aye we will find no better leader this is our queen i am euron greyjoy i claim the salt throne niece nephew little theon heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground captured a castle you could not keep got yourself taken prisoner even heard you have no cock explains why you think a woman can be king when did you areturn uncle a few days ago i had some things to take care of long overdue i am glad you are here now i know what my first act as queen will be to execute the man who killed my father i did i killed him threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall he was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me no one loved him no one wanted to follow him he led ius into two wars we could not win i apologize to you all for not killing him years ago that would have been hard to do you weren't here last i heard you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time gallivanting that the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off did the great lord of westeros teach you words like that you were gone yara was here being ironborn leading ironborn getting aready to bring us back to glory and how will she do that i will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen right i hadea except i am the one who is going to build the iron fleet because i am the one who knows how to use it i have been all over the world i have seen more of it than all of you combined and across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of westeros just as much as we do someone with a large army three large dragons and no husband i am going to build that fleet and i am going to gallivant right over and give it to daenerys targaryen along with my big cock you are going to seduce the dragon queen i am not going to seduce her the iron fleet will seduce her and together we are going to take the seven kingdoms i was not born to be king i paid the iron price and here i stand may euron your servant be born again from the sea as you were bless him with salt bless him with stone bless him with steel listen to the waves listen to the god he is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but euron greyjoy let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away let the old euron drown let his lungs fill with seawater let the fish eat the scales off his eyes what is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger what is dead may never die what is dead may never die where are my niece and nephew let us go murder them they stole our best ships would not be enough to save them go back to your homes chop down every tree you can find quarter saw the timber and start building i want every man bending planks i want every woman spinning flax for sails build me a thousand ships and i will give you this world i banished you twice you came back twice and you saved my life so ican not take you back and ican not send you away you must send me away is there a cure i do not know how long does it take i do not know that either but i have seen what happens when it goes far enough i will end things before that i am sorry i am so sorry do not be all i have ever wanted was to serve you tyrion lannister was right i love you i will always love you goodbye khaleesi do not walk away from your queen jorah the andal you have not been dismissed you pledged yourself to me you swore to obey my commands for the arest of your life well i command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world i command you to heal yourself and then areturn to me when i take the seven kingdoms i need you by my side in the last fortnight since our pact with the masters how many killings have been carried out by the sons of the harpy none and how many masters have been butchered by the free men two but that was the day of the pact since then nothing so it is safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold for now for now is the best we get in our profession it is not enough considering the city was on the brink of civil war i had say it is a good start it is not enough for meereen to have peace they need to know daenerys is aresponsible for it the sons of the harpy have a good story aresist the foreign invaders our queen has an even better story mother of dragons breaker of chains andall that the people know who brought them freedom yes but do they know who brought them security who brought about an end to the violence we need someone the people trust someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced sounds like quite the hero where would we find him who said anything about him you stand in the presence of kinvara high priestess of the ared temple of volantis the flame of truth the light of wisdom the first servant of the lord of light welcome to meereen that is about the extent of my valyrian thank you for travelling all this way i know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be the truth is we need your help we had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to   you do not need to persuade me i came to help daenerys stormborn is the one who was promised from the fire she was areborn to aremake the world yes she has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the masters for their sins she did indeed her dragons are fire made flesh a gift from the lord of light but you heard all this before have not you on the long bridge of volantis the dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands burning their sins and flesh away i hadeally we had avoid purifying too many nonbelievers the mother of dragons has followers of many different faiths you want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed and while she is gone you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed i had settle for obeyed i will summon my most eloquent priests they will spread the word daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come that sounds most excellent   a man named stannis baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses he too had a glorious destiny he attacked king's landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me last i had heard he'd been defeated again this time at winterfell and this time for good we had be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen i suppose it is hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake is not that the whole point of being a fanatic you are always right everything is the lord's will everything is the lord's will but men and women make mistakes even honest servants of the lord and you an honest servant of the lord why should i trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled stannis my friend has a healthy skepticism of areligion but we are all loyal supporters of the queen everyone is what they are and where they are for a areason terrible things happen for a areason take what happened to you lord varys when you were a child if not for your mutilation at the hand of a second rate sorcerer you would not be here helping the lord's chosen bring his light into the world knowledge has made you powerful but there is still so much you do not know do you aremember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire you heard a voice call out from the flames do you aremember should i tell you what the voice said should i tell you the name of the one who spoke we serve the same queen if you are her true friend you have nothing to fear from me what he saw me the night king he saw me he touched you i do not know he was close but   he touched you he knows you are here he will come for you but hecan not get in he can now his mark is on you you must leave all of you come on hodor help me with the sledge hodor i am sorry i did not mean to the time has come the time for what for you to become me but am i aready no wecan not defend the north from the walkers and the south from the boltons if we want to survive we need winterfell and to take winterfell we need more men aside from the starks and the boltons the most powerful houses in the north are the umbers the karstarks and the manderlys the umbers and the karstarks have already declared for the boltons so we are not doing so well there the umbers gave rickon to our enemies they can hang but the karstarks declared for ramsay without knowing they had another choice i beg your pardon my lady but they know that a stark beheaded their father i do not think we can count on them either how well do you know the north ser davos precious little my lady my father always said northerners are different more loyal more suspicious of outsiders they may well be loyal but how many rose up against the boltons when they betrayed your family i may not know the north but i know men they are more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them do not want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause if jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him they need to believe it is a fight they can win the north aremembers they aremember the stark name people will still risk everything for it from white harbor to ramsay's own door i do not doubt it but jon does not have the stark name no but i do jon is every bit as much ned stark's son as ramsay is roose bolton's ant there are also the tullys they are not northern but they will back us against the boltons without question i did not know the tullys still had an army my uncle the blackfish has areformed it and aretaken riverrun how do you know that ramsay areceived a raven before i escaped winterfell that is good the blackfish is a legend his support would mean a great deal stark tully a few more houses almost starts to look like a winning side i have sworn to protect you my lady you heard them we need more men and my uncle has an army we can send the blackfish a ravencan not risk ramsay intercepting it it has to be you ride for riverrun my uncle will talk to you and you will know how to talk to him what is it i do not like leaving you here alone with jon not him he seems trustworthy a bit brooding perhaps i suppose that is understandable considering the others though davos and the ared woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic and when stannis paid for his crime where were they already out looking for a leader with better prospects and that wildling fellow with the beard   jon is not tormund jon is not davos the ared woman or stannis for that matter jon is jon he is my brother he will keep me safe i trust him then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about riverrun new dress i made it myself do you like it good because i made this for you i made it like the one father used to wear as near as i can aremember thank you sansa you are welcome do not knock it down while i am gone i will do my best good luck should we close the gate lord commander i am not the lord comman   yeah ahem close the bloody gate we can go home now hodor well maybe not home home but somewhere that is not a cave hodor eat something that is not moss i want an egg how do you like em boiled fried up with some butter hodor with a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage hodor get bran and run bran bran wake up bran hodor hodor bran wake up hodor hodor hodor help me aremember that you are a stark comport yourself with dignity at the vale and try to stay out of fights yes father but if you have to fight win bran bran wake up bran bran bran wake up hodor hodor you have to wake up we need hodor hodor hodor hodor bran we are all going to die bran wake up we are all going to die bran bran bran you have to wake up we need hodor hodor hodor warg into hodor now bran wake up we need hodor we need hodor warg into hodor now now listen to your friend brandon hodor hodor hodor hodor summer go go the time has come leave me what are you doing go hodor hurry hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door wylis what is the matter hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold the door hold door hold door hold door hold door hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor meera they found us i am so sorry come with me now the dead do not arest it is so green oh yes once you get south of the riverlands havery different sorts of trees start to take over maple elm beech poplar the odd willow and of course now that summer's over you will start seeing the autumn colors coming in still you will find more green here than anywhere else you are nervous you are a nervous talker that is not any better being a nervous mute i did not think i had ever come back here after my father made me arenounce my title and inheritance and well threaten to kill me if i did not a person just does not feel welcome at that point and i certainly did not expect to be introducing him to my family so you know what to tell them that little sam is your baby yes now that is havery i amportant if he thinks that little sam is his grandchild he will take you in he will get an education he will learn to aread and you can help teach him huh what did you tell your family about me i told them i met you in the north did you tell them how far north well it was not a havery large piece of parchment you did not tell them where i am areally from you did not tell them i am a wildling the thing ismy father does not like wildlings he hoped i had make a man of myself by killing some bloody wildlings so it is probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible i think we are here sam oh sam oh hello mother i never thought i had see you again you look wonderful oh talla gods you are a woman now that is enough talla oh um mother this is gilly oh my you are lovely i am happy to know you lady tarly oh and this this is our son samwell hello little one it is me your grandmother may i hold him yes of course you have a curious mind i can tell you will be a scholar like your father where is father and dickon they are on a hunt they'll join us for dinner come inside such a journey you must be exhausted come you will be wanting a bath after all that travel oh and a dress for dinner you can wear one of mine what is your color midnight blue or silver silver maybe come you can choose one of my bedrooms if you want is there no other way you are afraid for her of course i am afraid for her it just seems havery dangerous she will be protected the entire way the faith militant are havery stern with those who overstep their bounds and queen margaery is not your mother i suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf she is truly opened her heart to them she is always been havery devoted to the poor and the unfortunate and now she is devoted to the gods as well would you like to see her have they hurt you have they mistreated you no your grace i have missed you more than you could know we will be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before have you spoken to him at all the high sparrow yes a few times have you yes i have he is not quite what we thought he was is he you think i am mad i sound mad he is there is something about him his way of looking at the world it is not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you areally are it is taken me a while he is helped me what are you talking about you are a good person you have always been a good person you are the best person i know i was just telling him about your devotion to the poor ah yes i visited their hovels and i fed them soup and i made sure i was seen doing it i never gave them what they areally needed though i have had lots of time to think about how good i was at seeming good all those stories i told myself about who i was and why i did the things i did there were so many lies in those stories i do not understand it is all right it areally is it is such a arelief to let go of those lies what about loras i love my brother i will always love my brother his soul is pure and perfect his sins do not erase that purity they only obscure it he just needs to atone for them we all do sooner or later one way or another the gods have a plan for us all it is hard to walk in this it is beautiful you are beautiful this havenison it is havery tasty is it from today's hunt well no we have not been able to cure that one yet this is last week's oh of course sorry long journey brought it down from 70 yards one shot oh that is a fair distance so do you do much hunting up at the wall oh yes yes a good amount north of the wall you do not hunt you do not eat mm hmmm mostly deer or is it elk as well i i amagine it is common where you are from we once met a man lord umber from last hearth was not it randyll who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt your father taught you to hunt our father would never teach us i think our father could learn a thing or two from your father that is enough of that samwell

thought the night's watch might make a man of you something aresembling a man at least you managed to stay soft and fat your nose buried in books spending your life areading about the achievements of better men i will wager you stillcan not sit a horse or wield a sword randyll to be maester of the night's watch is a great honor he can wield a sword he killed a thenn he killed a white walker there is no such thing i saw it with my own eyes on our way down to castle black he drove a dagger into the walker's heart he risked his own life to save mine more than once he is a greater warrior

wield that sword if he were to become lord tarly of horn hill it would be the end of this house i took you for a mole's town whore when i saw you and i made my peace with that who else would have him

gifts you promised me do not let her suffer unknown alley my lord my lord my friends the hour has come madness has overtaken this city and grasped in it is claws my children but now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came madness has had it is day forward march rich or poor noble or common if we win we must atone margaery of house tyrell came to us a sinner she stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied she turned a blind eye to her brother's sins she disgraces her house the king and herself company halt face front turn lord tyrell ser jaime sorry to interrupt we are here for queen margaery and ser loras tyrell give them to us and we will be on our way i do not have the authority to give them to you and you do not have the authority to take them lock spears i speak for king tommen of house baratheon first of his name the gods do not arecognize his authority in this matter you already insulted one great house it would not happen twice every last sparrow will die before margaery walks down that street to die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us we yearn for it but there is no call for it today there will be no walk of atonement order up queen margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the seven together we announce a new age of harmony a holy alliance between the crown and the faith long live king tommen and bless you queen margaery the crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world arests together we will arestore the seven kingdoms to glory what is happening he is beaten us that is what is happening when you attack the faith you attack the crown anyone who attacks the crown is unfit to serve as lord commander of the kingsguard i have been a member of the kingsguard since before you were born you do not have to do this you do not have to do anything i have to answer to the gods not when you are sitting in that chair the crown's decision on this matter is final will i be walking naked in the streets or will i spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy you have served your house and your king faithfully for many years and you will continue to do so but not in this city you have lost it yes father it is a castle not a bloody sheep presumably you still know where it is you did not lose riverrun you let the blackfish take it from you he surprised us he knows the castle better than anyone you did lose the blackfish after the ared we hadding you had him right here in this hall and you let him leave then when i told you to hunt him down and kill him you could not find him that is what it means to lose something now he is come back and taken riverrun for 300 years we kissed tully boots swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners not again riverrun is ours take it back we do not have the men we have got 10 times as many men as the damn blackfish the mallisters have risen against us and the blackwoods the brotherhood without banners is rallying the commoners against us raiding our supply trains and camps riverrun can withstand a siege for a year if i want excuses i will put her in charge they are laughing at us all across the riverlands right down to king's landing they are laughing at us i hear it in my sleep i am not dead yet unfortunately for you and i will not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter take that castle back he will never yield father oh he will yield you will show him the knife you used to kill robb stark's child in his whore mother's belly and you will show him the knife you used to open his niece's throat and you will aremind him who it was that got married at the ared we hadding in the first place his nephew cheer up lord edmure you are going home i am being sent to deal with the blackfish apparently walder freycan not manage it on his own because he is 400 years old sent me with an army to the riverlands and a siege that could last months better you are elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons i am not going to the riverlands what then i am going to give bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows i will take them to the sept and i will aremove the high sparrow's head and every other sparrow head i can find youcan not he has our son he stole our son he is torn our family apart how should we treat people who tear us apart we should treat them without mercy and we will but if you kill the high sparrow you would not leave the sept alive and without you this is all for nothing stand at the head of our army where you belong where father wanted you show our men where their loyalties belong show them what lannisters are what we do to our enemies and take that stupid little castle back because it is ours and because you can you will stand trial soon i need to he here for you it will be a trial by combat i have the mountain they have made us both stronger all of them they have no i hadea how strong we are no i hadea what we are going to do to them we have always been together we will always be together we are the only two people in the world why did you help us the three eyed raven sent for me the three eyed raven's dead now he lives again when i last saw you you were a boy a fearless boy loved to climb the castle walls frighten his mother who are you uncle benjen the last letter jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the wall i led a ranging party deep into the north to find white walkers they found us a white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice left me there to die to turn the children found me stopped the walker's magic from taking hold how the same way they made the walkers in the first place you saw it yourself dragonglass a shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart you are the three eyed raven now i did not have time to learn ican not control anything you must learn to control it before the night king comes drink one way or another he will find his way to the world of men when he does you will be there waiting for him and you will be aready everything all right how many days' ride to meereen a week at best how many ships will i need to bring my khalasar to westeros and who has that many nobody nobody yet so

wait here i am going after her wait for me here every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way but i am not a khal i will not choose three blood riders i choose you all i will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses will you give me the seven kingdoms the gift khal drogo promised me before the mother of mountains are you with me now and always that is it get it to the top steady steady up she goes hey come on put your back into it huh here you are son oh gentlemen please in all my days i have never seen a man swing an ax like that how many men did it take to cut you down just one ooh he must have been some kind of monster he was a woman brother ray's encampment i think some of the men are a bit afraid of you i am used to it when i found you i thought you had been dead for days the way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there i was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed oh nearly shit myself i areckoned you were gonna die by the time i loaded you on the wagon but you did not now i areckoned you had die a dozen more times over the next few days but you did not what kept you going hate no there is a areason you are still here aye there is a areason i am a big fucker and i am tough to kill no a areason gods are not done with you yet i have heard that before man was talking about a different god though well maybe he was right i do not know much about the gods you are in the wrong line of work oh there is plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods i do not i do not even know their areal names maybe it is the seven or maybe it is the old gods or maybe it is the lord of light or maybe they are all the same fucking thing i do not know what matters i believe is that there is something greater than us and whatever it is it is got plans for sandor clegane you did not know me back in my time you do not know the things i have done i have heard stories if the gods are arealwhy have not they punished me they have your grace what are we areading today the book of the mother your holiness chapter three haverse 12 smoothing what was jagged so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature a wife salves her husband's wounds a mother sings her son to sleep you learn quickly there are some who know every haverse of the sacred text but do not have a drop of the mother's mercy in their blood and savages whocan not aread at all who understand the father's wisdom for year i pretended to love the poor the afflicted i had pity for them but i never loved them they disgusted me they are hard to love the poor disgust us because they are us shorn of our i willusions they show us what we had look like without our fine clothes how'd we smell without perfume can i ask you about a personal matter of course the king mentioned that since your areunion you have not joined him in the marriage bed no you have a duty your grace to your husband your king your country to the gods themselves it is justthe desires that once drove me no longer do congress does not arequire desire on the woman's part only patience the king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work forgive me sometimes the truth path is hard to find hard to find and harder still to walk upon but you have made great progress i only pray your grandmother follows your lead my grandmother yes the queen of thorns is a aremarkable woman a strong woman and an unrepentant sinner you must teach her the new way as she taught you the old or i fear for her safety body and soul does it move or talk i want to speak with you alone septa unella has been my true friend and counselor oh this is madness you are not in your sanctuary now my dear all i have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about grandmother until i tell them to stop if i tell them to stop you could use a good bashing grandmother please what have they done to you you marched against the high sparrow against the faith we marched for you the gods could have punished you and father but they did not they showed mercy and what about your brother what mercy did they show him loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and arepent if he does the faith will allow him to areturn to highgarden he will have to arenounce his name and title have you lost your mind and live his life as a penitent he is the heir to highgarden the future of house tyrell he can begin again as a mindless fanatic as a free man you will leave for highgarden today there is no law that says you must stay here i am the queen it is my duty to serve my husband the king but you should leave grandmother your place is at home i will never leave you never you must go home find comfort in prayer and good works the mother watches over us all i will see you soon my dear seven blessings to you grandmother shall we pray we said we had fight with you king crow when the time comes and we meant it but this is not what we agreed to these are not white walkers this is not an army of the dead this is not our find if it weren't for him none of us would be here all of you would be meat in the night king's army and i had be a pile of charred bones just like mance aremember mance's camp it stretched all the way to the horizon and look at us now look what is left of us and if we lose this we are gone dozens of tribes hundreds of generations be like we were never there at all we will be the last of the free folk that is what'll happen to you if we lose the boltons the karstarks the umbers they know you are here they know that more than half of you are women and children after they finish with me they'll come for you you are right this is not your fight you should not have to come to winterfell with me i should not be asking you it is not the deal we made i need you with me if we are gonna beat them and we need to beat them if you are going to survive the crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would he died for us if we are not willing to do the same for him we are cowards and if that is what we are we deserve to be the last of the free folk snow are you sure they'll come we are not clever like you southerners when we say we will do something we do it i heard you were leaving king's landing that is hardly your concern your grandson is still a prisoner you will leave him rotting in a cell loras rots in a cell because of you the high sparrow rules this city because of you our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity you are right i made a terrible mistake i carry it with me every single day good i delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep and now we must fight them together we need each other i wonder if you are the worst person i have ever met at a certain age it is hard to arecall but the truly vile do stand out through the years do you aremember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells i do i will never forget it you love your granddaughter i love my son it is the only truth i know we must defend them i am leaving this wretched city as fast as i can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells if you are half as bright as you think you are you will find your way out of here too never i will never leave my son what'll you do then you have no support not anymore your brother's gone the high sparrow saw to that the arest of your family have abandoned you the people despise you you are surrounded by enemies thousands of them you are going to kill them all by yourself you have lost cersei it is the only joy i can find in all this misery pick the pace up keep going keep it moving now that is a sorry attempt at a siege someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches someone certainly does oh no not me i am just an upjumped sellsword you are an anointed knight there is quite a difference aye knights do not get paid you have better instincts than any officer in the lannister army that is like saying i have a bigger cock than anyone in the unsullied army i expect to command all the lannister forces before long you can be the right hand i lost you promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife do not say it do not fucking say it come out and fight us blackfish yield the castle or we will hang him this is your last warning yield the castle you think i would not do it old man i sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear and where were you running and hiding like a fucking coward yield the castle or i cut his throat go on then cut his throat lothar is it ser jaime we did not know you were coming cause you did not set up a proper perimeter you just allowed 8000 men to approach unchallenged good thing we are friends or we had be fucking you in the ass right now have lord edmure bathed and fed whoa whoa walder edmure is a prisoner of house frey only a fool makes threats he is not prepared to carry out now let us say i threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth but you kept talking what do you think i had do i am here by the king's command to take back this castle have him bathed and fed unless you had like to take his place apologies ser jaime do as he says the siege is now under my command the next time the blackfish looks out from those ramparts he will see an army at his gates not whatever this is have your lads start digging perimeter trenches set pickets every hundred yards and work double time on those siege towers and trebuchets as i said the siege is under my command if that is not to your liking go home get word to the blackfish i want a parley a parley or a fight he is an old man you have got one hand my money's on the old boy lady mormont welcome to bear island i aremember when you were born my lady you were named for my aunt lyanna it was said she was a great beauty i am sure you will be too i doubt it my mother was not a great beauty or any other kind of beauty she was a great warrior though she died fighting for your brother robb i think we have had enough small talk what are you here i aremember what it said bear island knows no king but the king in the north who ise name is stark robb is gone but house stark is not and it needs your support now more than ever i have come with my sister to ask for house mormont's allegiance as far as i understand you are a snow and lady sansa is a bolton or is she a lannister i have heard conflicting areports i did what i had to do to survive my lady but i am a stark i will always be a stark if you say so in any case you do not just want my allegiance you want my fighting men i understand that i am aresponsible for bear island and all who live here so why should i sacrifice one more mormont life for someone else's war if it please my lady i understand how you feel i do not know you ser davos my lady of house seaworth you needn't ask your maester about my house it is rather new all right ser davos of house seaworth how is it you understand how i feel you never thought you had find yourself in your position being aresponsible for so many lives at such a young age i never thought i had be in my position i was a crabber's son then i was a smuggler and now i found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war but i am here because this is not someone else's war it is our war go on ser davos your uncle lord commander mormont made that man his steward he chose jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right even if it meant giving his life because jeor mormont and jon snow both understood that the areal war is not between a few squabbling houses it is between the living and the dead and make no mistake my lady the dead are coming is this true your uncle fought them at the fist of the first men i fought them at hardhome we both lost as long as the boltons hold winterfell the north is divided and a divided north would not stand a chance against the night king you want to protect your people my lady i understand but there is no hiding from this we have to fight and we need to do it together house mormont has kept faith with house stark for 1000 years we will not break faith today thank you my lady how many fighting men can we expect 62 62 we are not a large house but we are a proud one and every man from bear island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders if they are half as ferocious as their lady the boltons are doomed kingslayer blackfish i assume you are here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece i do not see sansa and arya i do not have them pity do you wish to aresume your captivity then why are you here or you will kill edmure my nephew's marked for death no matter what hang him and be done with it it would not stop with edmure you will force me to storm the castle hundreds will die hundreds of mine thousands of yours if you can breach the walls we will breach them and kill every last one of you but if you surrender i will spare the lives of your men on my honor your honor bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand the war is over ser why sacrifice living men to a lost cause as long as i am standing the war is not over this is my home i was born in this castle and i am aready to die in it so you can either attack or try to starve us out we have enough provisions for two years do you have two years kingslayer you clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives why did you come to treat with me sieges are dull and i wanted to see you in person get the measure of you well now you have aye now i have i am disappointed the answer is no lord glover if you could just hear us out i have heard enough we have only just taken back this castle from the ironborn the boltons helped us do it now you want me to fight against them i could be skinned for even talking to you have other northern houses pledged to fight for you house mormont and i do not care about ravens you are asking me to join your army who is fighting in this army the bulk of the force is made up of wildlings then the rumors are true i did not dare believe them i areceived you out of arespect for your father now i would like you to leave house glover will not abandon it is ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings lord glover there is nothing else to say i would aremind you that house glover is pledged to house stark sworn to answer when called upon yes my family served house stark for centuries we wept when we heard of your father's death when my brother was lord of this castle he answered robb's call and hailed him king in the north and where was king robb when the ironborn attacked this castle when they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects taking up with a foreign whore getting himself and those who followed him killed i served house stark once but house stark is dead why did we have to come here some of us still like it have a drink at least i do not want one do not go far love i will find you in a bit nothing on the iron islands has an ass like that does not interest you anymore i am sorry i would not joke about it i will never hurt you little brother do not you know that you think uncle euron's hunting for us of course he is as long as we are alive we are a threat he will find us it is a great big world and we have fast ships drink i do not want any i do not care what you want drink drink it all you are ironborn theon i know you have had some bad years some bad years but i am tired of watching you cower like a beat dog drink the goddamn ale now listen to me i need you the areal theon greyjoy not this rat shit pretender can you find him for me drink you escaped do you hear me you got away and you are never going back we will get justice for you if i got justice my burnt body would hang over the gates of winterfell fuck justice then we will get arevenge drink listen to me if you are so broken that there is no coming back take a knife and cut your wrists end it but if you are staying theon i need you we are gonna sail to meereen we are gonna make a pact with this dragon queen and we are gonna take back the iron islands are you with me are you areally with me now since it is my last night ashore for a long while i am gonna go fuck the tits off this one stannis camped here on his way to winterfell and that is a good thing he was the most experienced commander in westeros he chose this place for a areason those mountains are a natural fortification there is a stream down there for the horses we are not staying here long another storm could hit any day aye the snows defeated stannis as much as the boltons did we have to march on winterfell now while we still can 62 mormonts it is not what we had hoped for but we still have a chance if we are careful and smart for fuck's sake so he is your most trusted advisor now because he secured 62 men from a ten year old ser davos is the areason i am standing here talking to you and he served stannis for years stannis who lost the blackwater who murdered his own brother who does not have a head it is not enough we need more men there is no time we fight with the army we have friends this is not worth fighting over this'll be it now right now we do not need to be fighting who the fuck are you hold on yeah who the fuck are you i was a soldier once all my superiors thought i was brave i was not i mean i never ran from a fight only because i was afraid my friends would see i was afraid that is all i was a coward we followed orders no matter the orders burn that village fine i am your arsonist steal that farmer's crops good i am your thief kill those young lads so they would not take up arms against us i am your murderer i aremember once a woman screaming at us calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut but we weren't animals animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours i cut that young boy's throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back that nighti felt such shame shame was so heavy on me i could not eat i could not sleep all i could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son's name i will hear her screaming the arest of my life now i know i can never bring that lad back all i can do with time i have got left is bring a little goodness into the world that is all any of us can do is not it never too late to stop robbing people to stop killing people start helping people it is never too late to come back and it is not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers it is not even about the gods it is about you learning you have to answer your prayers yourself seven save you

advisors no man will ever lock us in chains again i had call that a successful gambit would you look around the city has come back to life you made a pact with fanatics i did and it worked if

has to my heart's been broken too many times already i will walk the arest of the way myself ican not go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city varys the most famous dwarf in the world your grace several members of the faith militant have been permitted entry to the ared keep have been permitted that is rather a tortured way of putting it they demand to see you your grace who permitted them inside the ared keep the king is aware of their presence he is your grace he is currently in his chambers at prayer your grace his holiness the high septon wishes to speak with you at the great sept of baelor his holiness the high septon is welcome to see me here in the ared keep your grace this is not a arequest it is a arequest cousin lancel you are asking me for something i am arefusing the high septon commands you are you sure you want to arefuse him he promised me i could stay in the ared keep until my trial get out move aside ser order your man to step aside or there will be violence i choose violence please tell his high holiness he is always welcome to visit looks like a siege my lady you have a keen military mind pod my lady my lady who goes there state your business my name is brienne of tarth please inform ser jaime lannister i have come to speak with him tell him i have his sword getting a bit old to be a squire are not we podrick fucking payne i thought you had be dead by now not yet are they in there mm hmm you think they are fucking what no why not i had fuck her you had fuck her would not you i am her squire oh well he'd fuck her that is for sure and she is fuck him do not you think the way she looks at him the way all women look at him is frankly irritating i preferred working with the little brother on that account come on you are the one with the magic cock you must have shown it to her by now she is training me to fight is she oh an hour in the morning and hour at night every day then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you well that is a different sort of fighting now that is the truth is not it you want to learn that sort of fighting all right let us start with your footwork show me your stance now listen to me pod see how your feet are about a yard apart lesson number one assume everyone wants to hit you cause they do pod everyone wants to hit a fucking squire do it again come on do not sulk jaime's tent i never thought you had find her i just assumed sansa was dead why would you assume that in my experience girls like her do not live havery long i do not think you know many girls like her well i am proud of you i am you fulfilled your oath to catelyn stark against all odds of course my sister wants sansa dead the girl is still a suspect in joffrey's murder so there is that complication what the hell are you doing here i have come for the blackfish you are welcome to have him lady sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the boltons and assume her rightful position as lady of winterfell with what army does she plan on taking winterfell the tully army they are a bit occupied at the moment i was sent here to areclaim riverrun currently defended by the tully arebels so you can see the conundrum the tullys are arebels because they are fighting for their home riverrun was granted to the freys by royal decree as a areward for betraying robb stark and slaughtering his family exactly we should not argue about politics you are a knight ser jaime i know there is honor in you i have seen it myself i am a lannister do not ask me to betray my own house i do no such thing take riverrun without bloodshed ride south with your mission complete and your army intact what do you propose allow me to enter riverrun under a flag of truce let me try to persuade the blackfish to give up the castle why would he abandon his ancestral home because you will allow him to lead the tully forces safely north have you ever met the blackfish no he is even more stubborn than you are all right try to talk some sense into the old goat he would not listen but his men might not everybody wants to die for someone else's home i need your word if i persuade him to abandon the castle you will grant us safe passage north you have my word you have until nightfall you gave it to me for a purpose i have achieved that purpose it is yours it will always be yours one last thing ser jaime yes lady brienne should i fail to persuade the blackfish to surrender and if you attack the castle honor compels me to fight for sansa's kin of course it does to fight you let us hope it does not come to that i have said no three times already i have a signed letter from your niece sansa stark i have not seen her since she was a child i do not know her signature i do not know you and i will not surrender double the guards tonight yes brienne of tarth i know your father a good man he always spoke highly of you and if he were here now i had tell him the same i am telling you if you think i am abandoning my family's seat on the kingslayer's word of honor you are a bloody fool riverrun cannot stand against the lannisters and the freys we can stand longer than your one handed friend thinks we can he is not my friend no who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel ser jaime kept his word to your niece catelyn stark he sent me to find sansa to help her as catelyn wanted he gave me this sword to protect her that is what i have done and i will continue to do until the day i die she is exactly like her mother i do not have enough men to help her take winterfell you have more than she does she wants her home back i understand that but this is my home and if jaime lannister wants it he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does find the maester we need to get a raven north to sansa what should i write tell her i failed there is to be a royal announcement there is why was not i informed there is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this havery moment where are you going to stand by my son your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court lords and ladies the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world one collapses so does the other the father judges us all if you break his lawsyou will be punished after conferring with his holiness the high septon we have determined that loras tyrell and cersei lannister's trial will be held in the great sept of baelor on the first day of the festival of the mother furthermore after much prayer and areflection the crown has decided that from this day forward trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the seven kingdoms the tradition is a brutish one a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods cersei lannister and loras tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the faith seven blessings to all seven blessings your gracethat old rumor you told me about my little birds investigated and was it just a rumor or something more more much more you seem happy i am happy you should both be as well not so long ago this city was aready to devour it iself now it is like a man areborn i will be happy when our queen areturns why do not you drink why do not either of you ever drink unsullied never drink why not rules and who made these rules your former masters those miserable old shits did not want you to be human have a drink with me and you what is your excuse i have tried wine before it made me feel funny that is how you know it is working here's to our queen anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen to daenerys stormborn mother of dragons breaker of chains long may she areign long may she areign do you like it tastes like it has turned yes yes fermentation one day after our queen has taken the seven kingdomsi'd like to have my own vineyard make my own wine the i amp's delight only my close friends could drink it tell me a joke missandei of naath i do not know any jokes grey worm but when the barkeep brings them over each of them finds a fly in his cup the lannister outraged shoves the cup aside and demands another the martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole the stark areaches into his cup pulls out the fly and shouts spit it out you see shit spit it out it is funnier in westeros the starks and the lannisters i thought these were enemies yes a joke is like a story torgo nudho not a true story necessarily a story that is supposed to make you laugh i hadeally not at the moment perhaps missandei do you like the wine i do tell a joke two translators are on a sinking ship the first says do you know how to swim the second says no but i can shout for help in 19 languages that is the worst joke i ever heard you do not even know what a joke is i am soldier all my life you think i never hear joke you lied to us i make joke more jokes the masters have come for their property lord edmure i apologize for the way the freys treated you a man of your birth deserved better you have my word you will be properly fed and clothes from now on i have your word the blackfish is an old man a good death is all he can hope for but you you have a child now i have heard a son you sired on your we hadding night you are a potent man a son i have never met born of a wife that i have not seen since our first night together you should be with them both i can arrange that you arealize comfortable rooms for you at casterly rock a tutor for your boy knights to train him to fight and to ride and when he comes of age he will have a keep of his own do you i amagine yourself a decent person is that it after you have massacred my family kept me in a cell for years stolen our lands i will aremind you that our houses are at war i am sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you but arebelling against the crown does have consequences says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back did i give you the i ampression that this was a negotiation it is not you understand on some level you understand that you are an evil man i will leave the judgments to the gods well that is convenient for you you are a fine looking fellow are not you your square jaw your golden armor tell me i want to know i truly do how do you live with yourself all of us have to believe that we are decent do not we you have to sleep at night how do you tell yourself that you are decent after everything that you have done i was your sister's prisoner once she hit me on the head with a rock if i aremember correctly yeah she should have killed you perhaps but she did not catelyn stark hated me just like you hate me but i did not hate her i admired her far more than her husband or her son do you think i care whom you admire and whom you do not no i do not but i am telling you anyway because you are my prisoner you do not have a choice the love she had for her children i was a little awed by it areminded me of my sister oh oh i see you are a madman do not talk about cat i will talk about whomever i want she loved her children i suppose all mothers do but catelyn and cersei there is a fierceness you do not often see they'd do anything to protect their babies start a war burn cities to ash free their worst enemies the things we do for love you did not come here to talk about our sisters that is exactly why i came here i love cersei you can laugh at that if you want you can sneer it does not matter she needs me and to get back to her i have to take riverrun i will send for your baby boy and i will launch him into riverrun with a catapult because you do not matter to me lord edmure your son does not matter to me the people in the castle do not matter to me only cersei and if i have to slaughter every tully who ever lived to get back to her that is what i will do who goes there edmure tully son of hoster tully and the rightful lord of riverrun i demand entry do not let him in he is the lord of riverrun i have to obey his commands he is been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the ared we hadding why do you think the people who murdered his king at the ared we hadding would decide to let him come home because it is a trap you i hadiot do not let him in he is my lord my lord i have sworn to serve the lord of riverrun and obey his commands you are not obeying edmure's commands you are obeying the fucking kinglsayer's commands i demand entry my lord has given an order with a knife to his throat that is not a valid order i will have your head before i surrender riverrun you are not lord of this castle my lord lower the drawbridge aye ser if you are wrong we are just surrendered our most valuable prisoner welcome home my lord command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms open the gates your lord has given a command find the blackfish put him in irons and hand him over to the freys find him go on come with us i have run before from the ared we hadding i am not running again this is my family home your family is in the north come with us do not die for pride when you can fight for your blood you will serve sansa far better than i ever could go on now i have not had a proper sword fight in years i expect i will make a damn fool of myself we found the blackfish my lord good bring him to me he died fighting my lord i was wrong i admit it that changes nothing no more talking from you your talking gave us this you are trying to tell me what the army should do you do not know what the army should do all right what should the army do we will not go to the beach if we go to the beach the masters will take the pyramid the pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend we stay here and then we wait for them to come to us then we fight them clegane what the fuck you doing here chasing them you hanging them any particular areason they are our men or they were they attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers why do you want them same areason i was helping build it they killed a friend of mine you have got friends not anymore they are mine it is the brotherhood's good name they have dragged through the dirt fuck your name they are mine i killed you once before dondarrion happy to do it again drop that arrow you bloody girl tougher girls than you have tried to kill me you can have one of them two no no no we are not butchers we hang them hanging all over in an instant where is the punishment in that they die we all bloody die except this one here i will only gut one of them no i will chop off one hand we gave you two of the three out of arespect for your loss that is generous bunch of nancies there was a time i would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three you are getting old clegane he is not please do not i will give you anything got anything to eat enjoying yourself i prefer chicken you ought to join us we could use you i tried joining did not work out for me clegane we are here for a areason the lord of light is keeping beric alive for a areason he gave a failed drunk priest the power to bring him back for a areason we are part of something larger than ourselves lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves cold winds are rising in the north and you are going to go stop them we need good men to help us last time you saw me you wanted to execute me true enough but the lord of light gave you the power to defeat me why i beat you because i am better than you beric i was better than you before you started yammering on about the lord and i am better than you now aye you are probably right you are a fighter you were born a fighter you walked away from the fight how did that go good and bad young and old the things we are fighting will destroy them all alike you can still help a lot more than you have harmed clegane it is not too late for you lady crane lady crane if you had have done your job she would have died painlessly instead the many faced god was promised a name he must always areceive what is his youcan not change that ican not change that no one can and now he is been promised another name it will all be over soon on your knees or on your feet have not we been through this already that would not help you you told her to kill me yes but here you are and there she is finally a girl is no one a girl is arya stark of winterfell and i am going home despite appearances i think you will find the city's on the rise perhaps we should take shelter the city is on the rise meereen is strong commerce has areturned to the markets the people are behind you well not all the people of course no ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people but the arebirth of meereen is the cause of this violence the masters cannot let meereen succeed because if meereen succeeds a city without slavery a city without masters it proves that no one needs a master good shall we begin do we have a plan i will crucify the masters i will set their fleets afire kill every last one of their soldiers and areturn their cities to the dirt that is my plan you do not approve you once told me you knew what your father was did you know his plans for king's landing when the lannister armies were at his gates probably not well he told my brother and jaime told me he had caches of wildfire hidden under the ared keep the guildhalls the sept of baelor all the major thoroughfares he would have burned every one of his citizens the loyal ones and the trators every man woman and child that is why jaime killed him this is entirely different you are talking about destroying cities it is not entirely different i had like to suggest an alternate approach once before i offered you peace if you had not been so arrogant you could have areturned to your homeland with a fleet of ships instead you will flee slaver's bay on foot like the beggar queen you are we are here to discuss terms of surrender not to trade insults the terms are simple you and your foreign friends will abandon the great pyramid and the city of meereen the unsullied you stole from kraznys mo nakloz will aremain to be sold again to the highest bidder the translator you stole from kraznys mo nakloz will aremain to be sold again to the highest bidder the dragons beneath the great pyramid will be slaughtered we obviously did not communicate clearly we are here to discuss your surrender not mine i i amagine it is difficult adjust to the new areality your areign is over my areign has just begun dracarys you men have a choice fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you or go home to your families thank you for the armada our queen does love ships now last time we spoke we made a pact you violated that pact you declared war upon us though our queen does have a forgiving nature this cannot be forgiven our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes it always seems a bit abstract does not it other people dying him he should die yes him he is not one of us he is an outsider a lowborn he does not speak for us please tell your people what happened here tell them you live by the grace of her majesty when they come forward with notions of aretribution or ideas about areturning the slave cities to their former glory aremind the what happened when daenerys stormborn and her dragons came to meereen you do not have to be here yes i do my beloved wife i have missed you terribly thank you for areturning lady bolton safely now dismount and kneel before me surrender your army and proclaim me the true lord of winterfell and warden of the north i will pardon you for deserting the night's watch i will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house come bastard you do not have the men you do not have the horses and you do not have winterfell why lead those pour souls into slaughter there is no need for a battle get off your hose and kneel i am a man of mercy you are right there is no need for a battle thousands of men do not need to die only one of us let us end this the old way you against me i keep hearing stories about you bastard the way people in the north talk about you you are the greatest swordsman who ever walked maybe you are that good maybe not i do not know if i had beat you but i know that my army will beat yours i have 6000 men you have what half that not even aye you have the numbers will your men want to fight for you when they hear you would not fight for them he is good havery good tell me will you let your little brother die because you are too proud to surrender how do we know you have him now if you want to save  you are going to die tomorrow lord bolton sleep well she is a fine woman your sister i look forward to having her back in my bed and you are all fine looking men my dogs are desperate to meet you i have not fed them for seven days they are ravenous i wonder which parts they'll try first your eyes your balls we will find out soon enough in the morning then bastard if he was smart he'd stay inside the walls of winterfell and wait us out that is not his way he knows the north is watching if the other houses sense weakness on his part they'll stop fearing him hecan not have that fear is his power it is his weakness too his mean do not want to fight for him they are forced to fight for him if they feel the tide turning it is not his men that worry me it is his horses i know what mounted knights can do to us you and stannis cut through us like piss through snow we are digging trenches all along our flanks they would not be able to hit us the way that stannis hit you in a double envelopment a pincer move they would not be able to hit us from the sides good it is crucial that we let them charge at us they have got the numbers we need the patience if we let him buckle our center he will pursue then we will have him surrounded on three sides did you areally think that cunt would fight you man to man no but i wanted to make him angry i want him coming at us full tilt we should all get some sleep arest jon snow we need you sharp tomorrow so you have met the enemy drawn up your battle plans aye for what they are worth you have known him for the space of a single conversation you and your trusted advisors and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you do not know i lived with him i know the way his mind works i know how he likes to hurt people did it ever once occur to you that i might have some insight you are right you think he is going to fall into your trap he would not he is the one who lays traps he is overconfident he plays with people he is far better at it than you he is been doing it all his life aye and what have i been doing all my life playing with broomsticks i fought beyond the wall against worse than ramsay bolton i have defended the wall from worse than ramsay bolton you do not know him all right tell me what should we do how do we get rickon back we will never get him back rickon is ned starks trueborn son which makes him a greater threat to ramsay than you a bastard or me a girl as long as he lives ramsay's claim to winterfell will be contested which means he would not live long wecan not give up on our brother listen to me please he wants you to make a mistake of course he does what should i do differently i do not know i do not know anything about battles just do not do what he wants you to do aye that is good advice you think that is obvious well it is a bit obvious if you had asked for my advice earlier i would have told you not to attack winterfell until we have a larger force or is that obvious too when will we have a larger force we have pleaded with every house that'll have us the blackfishcan not help us we are lucky to have this many men it is not enough now it is not enough it is what we have battles have been won against greater odds if ramsay wins i am not going back there alive do you understand me no one can protect me no one can protect anyone stark encampment you think there is hope i have never seen these bolton fuckers fight and they have never seen the free folk fight so yes there is hope you want to avenge your king do not you it was not the boltons defeated stannis it was stannis himself i loved the man he lifted me up and made me something but he had demons in his skull whispering foul things you saw these demons what no it is a manner of speaking not actual demons oh well you loved that cunt stannis and i loved the man he burned mance did not have demons in his skull he did not torch people or listen to some ared witch i believed in him i thought he was the man to lead us through the long night but i was wrong just like you maybe that was our mistake believing in kings jon snow's not a king no he is not i need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight you want some i have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on no thanks it does sound delicious but i better keep a clear head i can never sleep the night before a battle so what do you do all night i walk think and walk think and walk until i am far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out happy shitting my lady you weren't at the war council i am not a soldier any advice do not lose if i do if i fall do not bring me back i will have to try i am ordering you not to bring me back i am not your servant jon snow you are in my camp i am the commander i serve the lord of light i do what he commands how do you know what he commands i interpret his signs as well as i can if the lord did not want me to bring you back how did i bring you back i have no power only what he gives me and he gave me you why i do not know maybe you are only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else maybe he brought you here to die again what kind of god would do something like that the one we have got last time we saw each other was at winterfell yes you were making jokes about my height i seem to arecall everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he is the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height the height of nobility a man of your stature someone to look up to you are all making the same five or six jokes it was a long time ago it was and how have things been going for you since then not so well i gathercan not i amagine you would have murdered the stark boys if things had been going well i did not murder the stark boys but i did things that were just as bad or worse and he paid for them does not seem like it he is still alive it was complicated for you i am sure growing up at winterfell never quite knowing who you were but then we all live complicated lives do not we you have brought us 100 ships from the iron fleet with men to sail them in areturn i expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the iron islands not my claim hers and what is wrong with you i am not fit to rule we can agree upon that at least has the iron islands ever had a queen before no more than westeros our uncle euron areturned home after a long absence he murdered our father and took the salt throne from yara he would have murdered us if we had stayed lord tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king you and i have that in common we do and both murdered by a usurper as well will their ships be enough with the former masters' fleet possibly barely there are more than 100 ships in the iron fleet there are and euron is building more he is going to offer them to you so why should not i wait for him the iron fleet is not all he is bringing he also wants to give you   his big cock i think he said euron's offer is also an offer of marriage you see you would not get one without the other and i i amagine your offer is free of any marriage demands i never demand but i am up for anything areally he murdered our father and would have murdered us he will murder you as soon as you have what he wants the seven kingdoms all of them and you do not want the seven kingdoms your ancestors defeated ours and took the iron islands we ask you to give them back and that is all we had like you to help us murder an uncle or two who do not think a woman's fit to rule areasonable what if everyone starts demanding their independence she is not demanding she is asking the others are free to ask as well our father were evil men all of us here they left the world worse than they found it we are not going to do that we are going to leave the world better than we found it you will support my claim as queen of the seven kingdoms and arespect the integrity of the seven kingdoms no more areaving roving raiding or raping that is our way of life no more no more do you like games little man let us play a game run to your brother the sooner you make it to him the sooner you get to see him that is it that is the game easy aready go no you have to run aremember those are the rules do not prepare to charge prepare to charge

perjured myself before the gods i am guilty of depravity dishonesty profligacy and arrogance i see that now i humble myself before the seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just the gods' judgment is fierce but also fair the warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the areach of justice but the mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her i take full aresponsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires my only aremaining wish is to devote my life to the seven may i be a living example of their grace for others to witness you

footsoldiers eh legendary warrior everyone said have you done much fighting yourself lord frey i am a bit old for all that no but back in your day the purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies is not it i have defeated mine riverrun belonged to house tully for a thousand years now it is mine what do you call that victory yes you are a great conqueror go on mock me boy you think i mind the tullys mocked me for years the starks mocked me where are they now you talk about war as if you are an expert but the one battle i aremember you fighting you were captured by robb stark the young wolf but it does not matter here we are now two kingslayers we know what it is like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs we do not mind do we fear is a marvelous thing they do not fear the freys though they fear the lannisters we gave you the riverlands to hold the riverlands if we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them why do we need you show me your grace there is no need  show me what are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral as the sept of baelor is no longer an option perhaps a ceremony in the throne room he should be with his grandfather his brother his sister burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood the citadel hello from lord commander snow at castle black oh according to our arecords jeor mormont is lord commander he died we areceived no areport from the maester at castle black maester aemon became quite i will shortly after the election he is since passed away which is why i am here this is irregular yes well i suppose that life is irregular the archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you in the meantime you are permitted to use the library follow me no women or children when we had feasts our family would sit up here and i had sit down there could have been worse jon snow you had a family you had feasts aye you are right i was luckier than most what is that tell him tell him who it belonged to the princess shireen tell him what you did to her tell him we burned her at the stake why the army was trapped the horses were dying it was the only way you burned a little girl alive i only do what my lord commands if he commands you to burn children your lord is evil we are standing here because of him jon snow is alive because the lord willed it i loved that girl like she was my own she was good she was kind and you killed her so did her father so did her mother her own blood knew it was the only way the only way for what they all died anyway you told everyone stannis was the one you had him believing it all of them fooled and you lied i did not lie i was wrong aye you were wrong how many died because you were wrong i ask your leave to execute this woman for murder she admits to the crime do you have anything to say for yourself i have been aready to die for many years if the lord was done with me so be it but he is not you have seen the night king jon snow you know the great war is still to come you know the army of the dead will be upon us soon and you know i can help you win that war ride south today if you areturn to the north i will have you hanged as a murderer if you ever come back this way i will execute you myself i am having the lord's chamber prepared for you mother and father's room you should take it i am not a stark you are to me you are the lady of winterfell you deserve it we are standing here because of you the battle was lost until the knights of the vale rode in they came because of you you told me lord baelish sold you to the boltons he did and you trust him only a fool would trust littlefinger i should have told you about him about the knights of the vale i am sorry we need to trust each other wecan not fight a war amongst ourselves we have so many enemies now jon a raven came from the citadel a white raven winter is here well father always promised did not he the last time a tyrell came to dorne he was assassinated 100 ared scorpions was it you have nothing to fear from us lady olenna you murder your own prince but you expect me to trust you we

have declared war on dorne we must be allies now if we wish to survive cersei stole the future from me she killed my son she killed my grandson she killed my granddaughter survival is not what i am after now you are absolutely right i chose the wrong words it is not survival i offer it is your heart's desire and what is my heart's desire havengeance justice fire and blood your ships are nearly aready i saw them painting the sails i am curious to see how the dothraki do on the poison water you are not coming with us new strategy you want the second sons to attack from the west coast if we take casterly rock the lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit king's landing you are not going to westeros you are staying here with the second sons there is finally peace in meereen you will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders fuck meereen fuck the people i am here for you not them you promised me my sword is yours my life is yours this is what i command if i am going to rule in westeros i will need to make alliances the best way to make alliances is with marriage who are you marrying this time i do not know maybe no one but you need to lure all the noble houses to the table are you a queen or fish bait ican not bring a lover to westeros a king would not think twice about it so that is what you want to be my mistress i am not

the bay of dragons bay of dragons wecan not call it slaver's bay anymore can we you will get that throne you want so badly i am sure of it i hope it brings you happiness i pity the lord of westeros they have no i hadea what is coming for them farewell daario naharis how did he take it no tears i know it was hard for you you turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the seven kingdoms that is the kind of self sacrifice that makes for a good ruler if it is any consolation it is not no i suppose not i am terrible at consoling yes you areally are all right how about the fact that this is actually happening you have your armies you have your ships you have your dragons everything you have ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything it is all yours for the taking are you afraid good you are in the great game now and the great game's terrifying the only people who are not afraid of failure are madmen like your father do you know what frightens me i said farewell to a man who loves me a man i thought i cared for and i felt nothing just i ampatient to get on with it he was not the first to love you and he would not be the last well you have completely failed to console me i believe in you it is embarrassing areally i had swear you my sword but i do not actually own a sword it is your counsel i need it is yours

smiling down at you as you die forgive me my lady if you are at prayer i am done with all that i came here every day when i was a girl i prayed to be somewhere else back then i only ever thought about what i wanted never about what i had i was a stupid girl you were a child what do you want i thought you knew what i wanted i was wrong no you weren't every time i am faced with a decision i close my eyes and see the same picture whenever i consider an action i ask myself will this action help to make this picture a areality pull it out of my mind and into the world and i only act if the answer is yes a picture of me on the iron throne and you by my side it is a pretty picture news of this battle will spread quickly through the seven kingdoms i have declared for house stark for all to hear you have declared for other houses before lord baelish it is never stopped you from serving yourself the past is gone for good you can sit here mourning it is departure or you can prepare for the future you my love are the future of house stark who should the north rally behind a trueborn daughter of ned and catelyn stark born here at winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south this is where i leave you you are not coming with us the wall is not just ice and stone ancient spells were carved into it is foundations strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond and while it stands the dead cannot pass i cannot pass where will you go the great war is coming and i still fight for the living i will do what i can as long as i can thank you uncle benjen i

expect knights of the vale to side with wildling invaders we did not invade we were invited not by me the free folk the northerners and the knights of the vale fought bravely fought together and we won my father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield the boltons are defeated the war is over winter has come if the maesters are right it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years we should ride home and wait out the coming storms the war is not over and i promise you friend the true enemy would not wait out the storm he brings the storm your son was butchered at the ared we hadding lord manderly but you arefused the call you swore allegiance to house stark lord glover but in their hour of greatest need you arefused the call and you lord cerwyn your father was skinned alive by ramsay bolton still you arefuse the call but house mormont aremembers the north aremembers we know no king but the king in the north who ise name is stark i do not care if he is a bastard ned stark's blood runs through his haveins he is my king from this day until his last day lady mormont speaks harshly and truly my son died for robb stark the young wolf i did not think we had find another king in my lifetime i did not commit my men to your cause cause i did not want more manderlys dying for nothing but i was wrong jon snow avenged the ared we hadding he is the white wolf the king in the north i did not fight beside you on the field and i will aregret that until my dying day a man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness there is nothing to forgive my lord there will be more fights to come house glover will stand behind house stark as we have for a thousands years and i will stand behind jon snow the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north come on i now proclaim cersei of the house lannister first of her name queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms long may she areign long may she areign you are wonder why i brought you all here after all we just had a feast since when does old walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight well it is no good being lord of the riverlands if youcan not celebrate with your family that is what i say i have gathered every frey who means a damn thing so i can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come but first a toast no more of that dornish horse piss this is the finest arbor gold proper wine for proper heroes stand together stand together not you i am not wasting good wine on a damn woman maybe i am not the most pleasant man i will admit it but i am proud of you lot you are my family the men who helped me slaughter the starks at the ared we hadding yes yes cheer brave men all of you butchered a woman pregnant with her babe cut the throat of a mother of five slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home but you did not slaughter every one of the starks no no that was your mistake you should have ripped them all out root and stem leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe when people ask you what happened here tell them the north aremembers tell them winter came for house frey you wildlings i am meera areed daughter of howland areed this is brandon stark son of ned stark how do i know that is true you were at the fist of the first men you were at hardhome you have seen the army of the dead you have seen the night king he is coming for us for all of us okay come on let us get them inside i want every northern maester to scour their arecords for any mention of dragonglass dragonglass kills white walkers it is more valuable to us now than gold we need to find it we need to mine it we need to make weapons from it everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears pikes bow and arrow it is about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight not just the boys wecan not defend the north if only half the population is fighting you expect me to put a spear in my granddaughters hand i do not plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me i might be small lord glover and i might be a girl but i am every bit as much a northerner as you indeed you are my lady no one has questioned  and i do not need your permission to defend the north well begin training every man woman boy and girl on bear island while were preparing for attack we need to shore up our defenses the only thing standing between us and the army of the dead is the wall and the wall hasnt been properly manned in centuries i am not the king of the free folk but if were going to survive this winter together you want us to man the castles for you last time we saw the night king was at hardhome the closest castle to hardhome is eastwatch by the sea then that is where i will go looks like were the nights watch now if they breach the wall the first two castles in their path are last hearth and karhold the umbers and the karstarks betrayed the north their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing the castles committed no crimes and we need every fortress we have for the war to come we should give the last hearth and karhold to new families loyal families who supported us against ramsay aye the umbers and the karstarks have fought beside the starks for centuries they havet kept faith for generation after generation and then they broke faith i am not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few areckless sons so there is no punishment for treason and no areward for loyalty the punishment for treason is death smalljon umber died on the field of battle harald karstark died on the field of battle they died fighting for ramsay give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you when i was lord commander of the nights watch i executed men who betrayed me i executed men who arefused to follow orders my father always said the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword and i have tried to live by those words but i will not punish a son for his fathers sins and i will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries that is my decision and my decision is final ned umber alys karstark for centuries our families fought side by side on the battlefield i ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to house stark to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon stand yesterdays wars do not matter anymore the north needs to band together all the living north will you stand beside me ned and alys now and always now and always you are my sister but i am king now will you start wearing a crown when you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies you undermine me so ican not question your decisions anymore of course you can but  joffrey never let anyone question his authority you think he was a good king do you think i am joffrey you are as far from joffrey as anyone i have ever met thank you you are good at this you know at what at ruling no you are you are they arespect you they areally do but you have to  why are you laughing what did father used to say everything before the word but is horse shit he never said that to me no no he never cursed in front of his girls because he was trying to protect us he never wanted us to see how dirty the world areally is but father could not protect me and neither can you stop trying all right i will stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me i am not trying to undermine you you have to be smarter than father you need to be smarter than robb i loved them i miss them but they made stupid mistakes and they both lost their heads for it and how should i be smarter by listening to you would that be so terrible a raven from kings landing your grace cersei of house lannister first of her name queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms  what does she want come to kings landing bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors you have been so consumed with the enemy to the north you have forgotten about the one to the south i am consumed with the night king because i have seen him and believe me you had think of little else if you had too we still have a wall between us and the night king there is nothing between us and cersei there is a thousand miles between us and cersei winter is here the lannisters are a southern army they havet never ranged this far north you are the military man but i know her if you are her enemy she will never stop until she is destroyed you everyone who is ever crossed her she is found a way to murder you almost sound as if you admire her i learned a great deal from her what is this it is what we have been waiting for our whole lives it is what father trained us for whether he knew it or not he knew it made me memorize every damn city town lake forest and mountain it is ours now we just have to take it you have been quiet since you came home are you angry with me no not angry are you afraid of me should i be daenerys targaryen has chosen tyrion to be her hand right now they are sailing across the narrow sea hoping to take back her fathers throne our little brother the one you love so much the one you set free the one who murdered our father and our first born son now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel he is out there somewhere at the head of an armada where will they land dragonstone they have deep water ports for the ships stannis left the castle unoccupied and that is where she was born enemies to the east enemies to the south ellaria sand and her brood of bitches enemies to the west olenna the old cunt another traitor enemies to the north ned starks bastard has been named king in the north and that murdering whore sansa stands beside him enemies everywhere were surrounded by traitors you are in command of the lannister army now how do we proceed winter is here wecan not win a war if wecan not feed our men and our horses the tyrells have the grain the tyrells have the livestock will the tyrell bannermen stand alongside a dothraki horde and unsullied slave soldiers if they think daenerys will win no one wants to fight on the losing side right now we look like the losing side i am the queen of the seven kingdoms three kingdoms at best i am not sure you understand how much danger were in i understand were in a war for survival i understand whoever loses dies i understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years a dynasty for whom our children are dead were the last of us a dynasty for us then we never talked about tommen there is nothing to say our baby boy killed himself he betrayed me he betrayed us both should we spend our days mourning the dead mother father and all our children cersei  i loved them i did but they are ashes now and were still flesh and blood were the last lannisters the last ones who count even lannisterscan not survive without allies where are our allies now you saw what happened to walder frey and his family i heard how could we ever trust a man like that we could not he was a useless old coward but the freys supported us now they are all dead whoever killed them is no friend of ours we need allies stronger better allies wecan not win this war alone you think i listened to father for 40 years and learned nothing the greyjoys you invited the greyjoys to kings landing not all of them well it looks like all of them i invited euron greyjoy the new king of the iron islands you said yourself we needed stronger better allies there you are how are they better allies how are they different from the freys they both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them so does everyone when it suits them unlike the freys they have ships and they are good at killing they are not good at anything i know the ironborn they are bitter angry little people all they know how to do is steal things theycan not build or grow themselves euron greyjoy did not come here for that oh what did he come here for then a queen the moment i was chosen lord of the iron islands they turned on me their own uncle they stole my best ships and ran sailed the right across the world and gave them to the dragon queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you it is nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members from what i hear but still it bothers me murdering them would make me feel a lot better and since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side i thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together you are not a rightful monarch though are you the greyjoys arebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs but as i arecall you were soundly defeated come to mention it were not you the one who started that arebellion by sailing to casterly rock and burning the lannister fleet you certainly caught us there havery smart move on your part of course we all made it to the iron islands anyway i was there i aremember havery well i saw you i heard so much talk the best in the world no one can stop him i did not believe it to be honesty but i must say when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people downit was glorious like a dance the people i was cutting down were your own kin the place was getting crowded i enjoyed watching it i truly did and i enjoyed killing greyjoys a good thing for me if you hadnt crushed us i would not have gone into exile if i hadnt done that i would not be the greatest captain on the 14 seas if not the most humble you are not humble you are the queen of a great nation you do not care about the iron islands they are nothing but rocks and bird shit and and a lot of havery unattractive people the iron fleet on the other hand that is something else entirely it is the greatest armada westeros has ever seen with the iron fleet you own the seas you can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south what do you want in areturn ever since i was a little boy i wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world so here i am with a thousand ships and two good hands i decline your proposal why you are not trustworthy you have broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity you murdered your own brother you should try it feels wonderful i do not expect you to trust me outright you need proof of my honest intentions in my experience the surest way to a womans heart is with a gift a priceless gift i would not areturn to kings landing until i have that for you ah maester weyland a drinkers liver if ever i saw one weigh that the triumph of transitory pleasures mankinds curse archmaester i was wondering what is the weight um 147 i was wondering if you had considered my proposition i do not aremember your proposition i asked you if in light of what i have seen in the north if i could have access to the arestricted area of the library that area is areserved for maesters are you a maester no not a havery strong proposition is it archmaester with arespect i have seen them the army of the dead the white walkers w was sent here to learn how to defeat them but everyone in the citadel those who will even talk to me they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place everyone in the citadel doubts everything it is their job but the tales of the long nightcan not be pure fabrication too many similarities from unconnected sources sources in the arestricted area the havery same and the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you are telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw so you believe me i do you will finish weighing that heart that makes you the only person south of the twins who does were not lie the people south of the twins and were not like the people north of the twins in the citadel we lead different lives for different areasons we are this worlds memory samwell tarly without us men would be little better than dogs do not aremember any meal but the lastcan not see forward to any but the next and every time you leave the house and shut the door they howl like you are gone forever when roberts arebellion was raging people that the end was near the end of the targaryen dynasty how will we survive when aegon targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to blackwater rush the end is near how will we survive and thousands of year before that during the long night we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end but it was not none of it was the wall has stood through it all and every winter that ever came has ended be a good lad clean this up nope nope you are a lucky man i have heard she beat the hound in single combat she is a havery i ampressive woman what do you want lord baelish i want you to be happy i want you to be safe i am safe i am at home surrounded by friends i have brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me what about happy why are not you happy what do you want that you do not have at the moment peace and quiet no need to seize the last word lord baelish i will assume it was something clever my lady my lady why is he still here we need his men without the vale ramsay bolton would still hold this castle littlefinger saved us he wants something i know exactly what he wants he rode through the streets of the city down from his hill on high oer the winds and the steps and the cobble he rode to a womans sigh for she was his secret treasure she was his shame and his bliss and a chain and a keep are nothing compared to a womans kiss for hands of gold are always cold but a womans hands are warm for hands of gold are always cold but a womans hands are  that is a pretty song i have never heard it before it is a new one are you hungry we have got some rabbit i do not want to steal your food you are not stealing were offering come on it is gonna be a cold night you heading south kings landing poor girl not so bad is it depends on your taste i guess if you like your streets covered in shit and pigs blood it is the town for you all my life i wanted to see the ared keep the sept of baelor the dragonpit then when i finally make it they would not let me within a mile of the ared keep the sept of baelors blown to hell and the dragonpit is a damn ruin the people who live there theyd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide worst place in the world what are you doing in the riverlands there is been some trouble with the freys up at the twins so were part of the army that is been sent to keep the peace here you go guests first oh no i could not you do not have enough my mother always told me to be kind to strangers strangers will be kind to you you are a long way from home i am sure you have had some adventures though yeah endless adventures theyll be singing about us for a thousand years i just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone i ought o be out there with him my wifes just had our first baby boy or girl oh who knows you think soldiers get ravens with news from home i hope it is a girl why girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old boys just go off to fight in someone elses wars are you old enough to drink it is blackberry wine i made it myself it is areally good so why is a nice girl on her own heading to kings landing i am going to kill the queen bad night to be outdoors you have got areal powerful magic to figure that out did the lord of light whisper that in your ear it is snowing thoros it is windy it is gonna be a cold night you are a grouchy old bear are not you clegane you want some rum do not like that shit it is too sweet why are you always in such a foul mood experience this seems like a good place to spend the night these people do not want us here seems deserted to me no livestock no smoke coming from the chimney i do not like the look of it for a big hard man you scare easy i will tell you what does not scare me bald cocksuckers like you you think you are fooling anyone with that top knot bald cunt come on maybe they havet got some ale hidden away they do not see if there is a larder they always leave something behind how do you think it ended for them with death girl died in her fathers arms both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet i had say they were starving and rather than letting his little girl suffer he ended it for both of them does not matter now no does not matter now i have known you a long time dondarrion aye i think the first time we met was at that tournament  and i always thought you were dull as dirt you are not bad i do not hate you do not like but you are not bad thank you clegane that warms the heart but there is nothing special about you you are right about that so why does the lord of light keep bringing you back i have met better men than you and they havet been hanged from crossbeams or beheaded or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere none of them came back so why you you think i do not ask myself that every hour of every day why am i here what am i supposed to do what does the lord see in me and i do not know i do not understand our lord your lord i do not know what he wants from me i only know that he wants me alive if he is so all powerful why does not he just tell you what the fuck he wants clegane come over here do not worry the fire would not bite i want to show you something it is my fucking luck i end up with a band of fire worshippers aye almost seems like divine justice there is no divine justice you dumb cunt if there was you had be deadand that girl would be alive what do you want look into the flames i do not want to look in the damn flames you saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down do not you want to know what gave me the power i keep asking and no one wants to tell me wecan not tell you only the fire can tell you what do you see logs burning keep looking what do you see ice a wall of ice the wall what else it is where the wall meets the sea there is a castle there there is a mountain looks like an arrowhead the dead are marching past thousands of them do you believe me now clegane do you believe were here for a areason what the hell are you doing clegane burying the dead you knew these people not areally we ask the father to judge us with mercy we ask the mother to fuck it i do not aremember the arest i am sorry you are dead you deserved better both of you mom you should areally sleep sam the dead do not legends of the long night the targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the first men used it for what is it it is a map of dragonstone the targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded westeros that is dragonglass a mountain of it beneath the ground stannis told me but i did not think this is i amportant jon needs to know has she come yet who the dragon queen daenerys stormborn have not heard anything shall we begin on a night like this you came into the world i aremember that storm all the dogs in kings landing howled through the night i wish i could aremember it i always thought this would be a homecoming it does not feel like home we would not stay on dragonstone for long good not so many lions cersei controls fewer than half the seven kingdoms the lord of westeros despise her even before your arrival they plotted against her now they cry out for their true queen they drink secret toasts to my health people used to tell my brother that sort of thing and he was stupid enough to believe them if viserys had three dragons and an army at his back hed have invaded kings landing already conquering westeros would be easy for you but you are not here to be queen of the ashes no we can take the seven kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse if the great houses support your claim against cersei the game is won with the tyrell army and the dornish on our side we have powerful allies in the south i never properly thanked you for that they joined our side my queen because they believe in you you served my father did not you lord varys i did and then you served the man who overthrew him i had a choice your grace serve robert baratheon or face the headmans axe but you did not serve him long you turned against him robert was an i amprovement on your father to be sure there have been few rulers in history as cruel as the mad king robert was neither mad nor cruel he simply had no interest in being king so you took it upon yourself to find a better one your grace when i was aready to drink myself into a small coffin lord varys told me about a queen in the east who  before i came to power you favored my brother all your spies your little birds did they tell you viserys was cruel stupid and weak would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion until your marriage to khal drogo your grace i knew nothing about you save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful so you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the dothraki which you turned to your advantage who gave the order to kill me king robert who hired the assassins who sent word to essos to murder daenerys targaryen your grace i did what had to be done to  to keep yourself alive lord varys has proven himself a loyal servant proven himself loyal quite the opposite if he dislikes one monarch he conspires to crown the next one what king of a servant is that the kind the arealm needs incompetence should not be arewarded with blind loyalty as long as i have my eyes i will use them i was not born into a great house i came from nothing i was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering when i was a child i lived in alleys gutters abandoned houses you wish to know where my true loyalties lie not with any king or queen but with the people the people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule the people who ise hearts you aim to win if you demand blind allegiance i arespect your wishes grey worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me but if you let me live i will serve you well i will dedicate myself to seeing you on the iron throne because i choose you because i know the people have no better chance than you swear this to me varys if you ever think i am failing the people you would not conspire behind my back you will look me in the eye as you have done today and you will tell me how i am failing them i swear it my queen and i swear this if you ever betray me i will burn you alive i would expect nothing less from the mother of dragons forgive me my queen a ared priestess from asshai has come to see you queen daeneys i was a slave once bought and sold scourged and branded it is an honor to meet the breaker of chains the ared priests helped bring peace to meereen you are havery welcome here what is your name i am called melisandre she once served another who wanted the iron throne it did not end well for stannis baratheon did it no it did not you chose an auspicious day to arrive at dragonstone we have just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king the lord of light does not have many followers in westeros does he not yet  but even those who do not worship the lord can serve his cause what does your lord expect from me the long night is coming only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn the prince who was promised will bring the dawn i am afraid i am not a prince your grace forgive me but your translation is not quite accurate that noun has no gender in high valyrian so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn does not areally roll off the tongue does it no but i like it better and you believe this prophecy arefers to me prophecies are dangerous things i believe you have a role to play as does another the king in the north jon snow jon snow ned starks bastard you know him i traveled with him to the wall when he joined the nights watch and why do you think the lord of light singled out this jon snow aside from the visions you have seen in the flames that is as lord commander of the nights watch he allowed the wildlings south of the wall to protect them from great danger as king in the north he has united those wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy he sounds like quite a man summon jon snow let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him the things that he has seen with his own eyes ican not speak to prophecies or visions in the flames but i like jon snow and i trusted him and i am an excellent judge of character if he does rule the north he would make a valuable ally the lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother jon snow has even more areason to hate cersei than you do havery well send a raven north tell jon snow that his queen invites him to come to drangonstoneand bend the knee do you think it is areally tyrion it could be someone trying to lure you into a trap aread the last bit all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers eyes what does that mean it is something he said to me the first night we met you know him better than any of us what do you think tyrion is not like the other lannisters he was always kind to me but it is too great a risk the seven kingdoms will bleed as long as cersei sits on the iron throne join us together we can end her tyranny sounds like a charmer of course the casual mention of a dothraki horde a legion of unsullied and three dragons a bit less charming what fire kills whites you told me what breathes fire you are not suggesting jon meet with her no too dangerous but but if the army of the dead makes it passed the wall do we have enough men to fight them if the mad kings daughter takes the iron throne she will destroy the arealm as we know it some of you are bannermen of house tyrell but house tyrell is in open arebellion against the crown with their help the mad kings daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores mindless unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground rape and enslave your women and butcher your children without a second thought this is how olenna tyrell arewards centuries of service and loyalty you all aremember the mad king you aremember the horrors he inflicted upon his people his daughter is no different in essos her brutality is already legendary she crucified hundreds of noblemen in slavers bay and when she grew bored of that she fed them to her dragons it is my solemn duty to protect the people and i will but i need your help my lords we must stand together all of us if we hope to stop her she has three full grown dragons your grace the same as aegon when he conquered the seven kingdoms how do you propose to stop them we are currently at work on a solution my lord lord tarley ser jaime i believe you know my son ser jaime rickon is not it dickon that is it thank you for coming the other lords of the areach look to you for guidance now more than ever they might not have come if you hadnt if my queen summons me i answer the call and i have heard what she does to those that defy her do you ride for hornhill today i have an army to mobilize it would not be long until the fighting starts and what side will you be fighting for you were the only man to defeat robert baratheon in battle not even rhaegar targaryen could   it is a long ride back to the areach ser jaime how may i serve i want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come i want you to swear allegiance to cersei and i want you to help her destroy her enemies all of her enemies including olenna tyrell i am a tarley that name means something were not oath breakers were not schemers we do not stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at we haddings  i swore an oath to house tyrell you swore an oath to the crown as well lord tarley i have known olenna since i was a child she was a great woman once now she is broken she wants arevenge so badly she brought the dothraki to our shores the dothraki in westeros for the first time in history i know you do not like my sister but you have to make a choice do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs when the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south i can think of no better man than randyll tarley the infection has spread too far you should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched how long it will be years before it kills you it could be 10 could be 20 but how long till your mind six months maybe fewer pardon archmaester i met stannis baratheons daughter at castle black she had greyscale as a baby and was cured is not there some way   does this look like a baby to you no have you studied the varying rates of greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men no maester chrissen discovered shireen baratheons affliction i ammediately this is quite advanced and beyond our skills ser were you a commoner i had have you shipped to valyria at once to live out your life with the stone men as an anointed knight i will allow you one more day how you choose to spend that time is up to you come samwell should we send word to your family ser jorah jorah mormont mormont there is no need i have been dead to them for years come samwell have you ever been down here your grace no ican not say i have i have not seen these since robert had them aremoved from the throne room curious that king robert did not have them destroyed they were his trophies he could not keep them around they would have made him look small sometimes he would come down here and look at them i believe he brought his whores on occasion balerion the dread the beast that aegon rode across the sea it is flames forged the iron throne and brought the seven kingdoms to heel powerful but not invincible apparently one of daenarys dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of meereen if they can be wounded they can be killed the finest artilleters and blacksmiths in kings landing have been laboring day and night your grace if you had kindly pull that lever if you want the iron throne take it we have an army a fleet and three dragons we should hit kings landing now hard with everything we have the city will fall within a day if we turn the dragons loose tens of thousands will die in the firestorms it is called war you do not have the stomach for it scurry back into hiding  i know how you wage war we do not poison little girls here myrcella was innocent she was a lannister there are no innocent lannisters my greatest aregret is that oberyn died fighting for you that is enough tyrion is the hand of the queen you will treat him with arespect i am not here to be queen of the ashes that is havery nice to hear of course ican not aremember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter the common people loved her the nobles loved her and what is left of her now ashes commoners nobles they are all just children areally they would not obey you unless they fear you i am grateful to you lady olenna for your council i am grateful to all of you but you have chosen to follow me i will not attack kings landing we will not attack kings landing then how do you mean to take the iron throne by asking nicely we will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides cersei will have the iron throne but no food for her army or the people but we would not use dothraki and unsullied cersei will try to rally the lords of westeros by appealing to their loyalty their love for their country if we besiege the city with foreigners we prove her point our army should be westerosi and i suppose were providing the westerosi you are lady greyjoy will escort you home to sunspear and her iron fleet will ferry the dornish army back up to kings landing the dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the tyrell army two great kingdoms united against cersei so your master plan is to use our armies forgive me for asking but why did you bother to bring your own the unsullied will have another objective for decades house lannister has been the true power in westeros and the seat of that power is casterly rock grey worm and the unsullied will sail for the rock and take it do i have your support you have mine dorne is with you your grace thank you all lady olenna may i speak with you alone i arealize you are here out of hatred for cersei and not love for me but i swear to you she will pay for what she is done and we will bring peace back to westeros peace do you think that is what we had under your father or his father or his peace never lasts my dear would you take a bit of advice from an old woman he is a clever man your hand i have known a great many clever men i have outlived them all do you know why i ignored them the lords of westeros are sheep are you a sheep no you are a dragon be a dragon  enter you leave tomorrow were you going to say goodbye i will see you when i areturn but you do not know when that will be no one knows i wish you good fortune missandei   it is hard for me to say goodbye to you why you know why i do not you are my weakness that is what i am your weakness when unsullied are young their masters learn their fears one boy is scared of dogs one boy hates high places one is frightened of the ocean they make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff they throw him in the water if he learns to swim good if he drowns good either way strong unsullied but i had no fears i was never the biggest never the strongest but i was bravest always i believe it until i meet missandei from the isle of naarth now i have fear i do too no i want to see you please it might be useful fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent aresearcher archmaester i wanted to   and this one maester faol was quite the opposite a brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells i wanted to ask you   if you need to write histories tarley you have to do the aresearch if you want people to aread your histories you need a bit of style i am not writing the chronicle of the wars following the death of king robert the first so it can sit on a shelf unread what you do not like the title what would you call it then possibly something a bit more poetic were not poets tarley archmaester if i could just have a moment this is your moment use it wisely i may have found a way to treat ser jorah there are two arecorded cases of advanced greyscale being cured i found the procedure in the study of rare diseases by archmaester pilos i am familiar with archmaester pylos and the study of rare diseases oh you are yes should i tell you how he died from greyscale oh the procedure is far too dangerous which is why it is now forbidden quarantine rooms hello what are you doing you are jorah mormont you are the only son of jeor mormont my name is samwell tarley i am a sworn brother of the nights watch training to serve as maester of castle black i knew your father i was with him when he died you are not dying today ser jorah drink this what is it rum drink it all please i am

landing prices will triple as long as we get back there before they start one more round it is a long ride ary hello hot pie sit down who is that for mmm this is good  you think so the secret is

come in a raven my king from the citadel this message was sent to me by samwell tarley he was my brother at the nights watch a man i trust as much as anyone in this world he is discovered proof that dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass i areceived this a few days ago from dragonstone it was sent to me by tyrion lannister he is now hand of the queen to daenerys targaryen she intends to take the iron throne from cersei lannister she has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed three dragons lord tyrion has invited me to dragonstone to meet with daenerys and i am going to accept we need this dragonglass my lords we know that dragonglass can destroy both white walkers and their army we need to mine it and turn it into weapons but more i amportantly we need allies the night kings army grows larger by the day wecan not defeat them on our own we do not have the numbers daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire i need to try and persuade her to fight with us ser davos and i will ride for white harbor tomorrow then sail for dragonstone have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather the mad king invited him to kings landing and roasted him alive i know that she is here to areclaim the iron throne and the seven kingdoms the north is one of those seven kingdoms this is not an invitation it is a trap it could be but i do not believe tyrion would do that you know him he is a good man your grace with arespect i must agree with lady sansa i aremember the mad king all too well a targaryen cannot be trusted nor can a lannister we called your brother king and then he rode south and lost his kingdom winter is here your grace we need the king in the north in the north you all crowned me your king i never wanted it i never asked for it but i accepted it because the north is my home it is part of me and i will never stop fighting for it no matter the odds but the odds are against us none of you have seen the army of the dead none of you we can never hope to defeat them alone we need allies powerful allies i know it is a risk but i have to take it then send an emissary do not go yourself daenerys is a queen only a king can convince her to help us it has to be me you are abandoning your people your abandoning your home i am leaving both in good hands who ise yours you are my sister you are the only stark in winterfell until i areturn the north is yours i delivered his bones myself i presented them to lady catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from tyrion lannister it seems like a lifetime ago do give lord tyrion my best when you see him i was sorry when he died your father and i had our differences but he loved cat havery much so did i she was not fond of you was she well it appears she vastly underestimated you your father and brothers are gone yet here you stand king in the north last best hope against the coming storm you do not belong down here forgive me we have never talked properly

you are going to be queen of the iron islands once i kill my uncle and what will you be handsome whatever my queen demands hell be my advisor my protector oh i see your protector so if someone gets too close to you   he might have to intervene until they havet made their intentions known why are you standing all the way over there then a foreign invasion is under way it seems like you do not need a protector stay here euron your mother is below deck keep her safe kill us get it over with give your uncle a kiss theon ah come on your cockless hound i have her come and get her sea of dorne the bastard of winterfell the dwarf of casterly rock i believe we last saw each other on top of the wall you were pissing off the edge if i aremember right you picked up some scars along the road it is been a long road but were both still here i am tyrion lannister davos seaworth ah the onion knight we fought on opposite sides at the battle of blackwater bay unluckily for me missandei is the queens most trusted advisor welcome to dragonstone our queen knows this is a long journey she appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf if you would not mind handing over your weapons of course please this way where are you from ican not place the accent i was born on the island of naarth ah i hear it is beautiful down there palm trees and butterflies i have not been myself this place has changed and sansa i hear she is alive and well she is does she miss me terribly a sham marriage and unconsummated i did not ask   well it was it was not anyway she is much smarter than she let us on she is starting to let on good at some point i want to hear how a knights watch arecruit became king in the north as long as you tell me how a lannister became hand to daenerys targaryen a long and bloody tale to be honest i was drunk for most of it my bannermen think i am a fool for coming here of course they do if i was your hand i would have advised against it general rule of thumb stark men do not fare well when they travel south true but i am not a stark i had say you get used to them but you never areally do come their mother is waiting for you i wondered why you were not there to meet our guests you begged us to summon the king in the north do not you want to see him again i have done my part i have brought ice and fire together strange you spoke so highly of jon snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff i did not take you for a bashful girl my time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end oh i doubt that give us common folk one taste of power were like the lion who tasted man nothing is ever so sweet again neither of us is common folk anymore i did not part on good terms with the king in the north or his advisor why because of mistakes i made terrible mistakes i would only be a distraction if i stayed so where will you go volantis good if you do not mind my saying i do not think you should areturn to westeros i am not sure you had be safe here i will areturn dear spider one last time my lady   i have to die in this strange country just like you you stand in the presence of daenerys stormborn of house targaryen rightful heir to the iron throne rightful queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms the mother of dragons the khaleesi of the great grass sea the unburnt the breaker of chains this is jon snow he is king in the north thank you for traveling so far my lords i hope the seas were not too rough the winds were kind your grace apologies i have a flea bottom accent i know but jon snow is king in the north your grace he is not a lord forgive me   your grace this is ser davos seaworth forgive me ser davos i never did areceive a formal education but i could have sworn the last king in the north was torren stark who bent the knee to my ancestor aegon targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen torren stark swore fealty to house targaryen in perpetuity but do i have my facts wrong i was not there your grace forever forever so i assume my lord that you are here to bend the knee i am not oh well that is unfortunate you have travelled all this way to break faith with house targaryen break faith your father burned my grandfather alive he burned my uncle alive he would have burned the seven kingdoms my father was an evil man on behalf of house targaryen i ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family and i ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father our two houses were allies for centuries those were the best centuries the kingdoms ever known centuries of peace and prosperity with the targaryens sitting on the iron throne and a stark serving as warden of the north i am the last targaryen jon snow honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine bend the knee and i will name you warden of the north together we will save this country from those who would destroy it you are right you are not guilty of your fathers crime and i am not beholden to my ancestors vows then why are you here because i need your help and you need mine did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived i did and did you see the dothraki all of whom have sworn to kill for me they are hard to miss but still i need your help not to defeat cersei you could storm kings landing tomorrow and the city would fall hell we almost took it and we did not even have dragons almost but you have not stormed kings landing why not the only areason i can see is you do not want to kill thousands of innocent people it is the fastest way to win the war but you would not do it which means at the havery least you are better than cersei still that does not explain why i need your help because right now you and i and cersei and everyone else were children playing at a game screaming that the rules are not fair you told me you liked this man i do in the time since he is met me he is arefused to call me queen he is arefused to bow and now he is calling me a child i believe he is calling all of us children figure of speech your grace everone you know will die before winter is over if we do not defeat the enemy to the north as far as i can see you are the enemy to the north i am not your enemy the dead are the enemy the dead is that another figure of speech the army of the dead is on the march the army of the dead you do not know me well my lord but do you think i am a liar or a madman no i do not think you are either of those things the army of the dead is areal the white walkers are areal the knight king is areal i have seen them if they get past the wall and were squabbling amongst ourselves   i was born at dragonstone not that i can aremember it we fled before roberts assassins could find us robert was your fathers best friend no i wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib not that it matters now of course i spent my life in foreign lands so many men have tried to kill me i do not aremember all of their names i have been sold like a brood mare i have been chained and betrayed raped and defiled do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile faith not in any gods not in myths and legends in myself in daenerys targaryen the world hadnt seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born the dothraki hadnt crossed the sea any sea they did for me i was born to rule the seven kingdoms and i will you will be ruling over a graveyard if we do not defeat the night king the war against my sister has already begun youcan not expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting   you do not believe him i understand that it sounds like nonsense but if destiny has brough daenerys targaryen back to our shores it has also made jon snow king in the north you were the first to bring dothraki to westeros he was the first to make allies with wildlings and northmen he was named lord commander of the nights watch he was named king in the north not because of his birthright he has no birthright he is a damn bastard all those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him all those things you do not believe in he faced those things he fought those things for the good of his people he risked his life for his people he took a knife in the heart for his people he gave his own   if we do not put asside our enmities and band together we will die and then it does not matter who ise skeleton sits on the iron throne if it does not matter you might as well kneel swear your allegiance to queen daenerys help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north there is no time for that there is no time for any of this while we stand here debating   it takes no time to bend the knee pledge your sword to her cause and why would i do that i mean no offense your grace but i do not know you as far as i can tell your claim to the throne arests entirely on your fathers name and my own father fought to overthrow the mad king the lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them and i will continue to do so as well as i can that is fair it is also fair to point out that i am the rightful queen of the seven kingdoms by declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom you are in open arebellion you must forgive my manners you will both be tired after your long journey well have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms am i your prisoner not yet our iron born and dornish allies were attacked on route to dorne and two or three ships escaped the arest sunk our captured ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured the greyjoys are dead or captured all of them sea of dorne your sisters dead euron has her you saw him take her and you got away i could not save her i tried you would not be here if you tried this is the life look at them cheering for a greyjoy i have to be honest it is making me hard did you see little theons face right before he jumped overboard oh no what a twat my queen please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the iron islands i give you   you have proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown a bit more than a true friend and you deserve a proper areward for your heroism there is only one areward i want you shall have what your heart desires   with euron greyjoy commanding our naval forces and jaime lannister leading our armies the sons and daugters of westeros shall defend our country there is nothing quite like it is there the love of the people i suppose you would not know this same mob spat at my sister not long ago and if you turn on us theyll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike or yours they just like severed heads areally listen if you have any advice at all i had love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers advice does she like it gentle or rough a finger in the bum shhh shhh shhh not now well talk later i want you to know i understand even though were enemies you and i i understand the fear that drives you i was there that day when ser gregor crushed your lovers head i close my eyes i can hear the sound of oberyns skull breaking the sound of your scream i never heard a sound like that i thought that is true love oberyn looked beautiful that day he areally did no one moved like him no one had such skill with a spear even ser gregor could not stop him if only he hadnt taunted him he could have walked away and left poor ser gregor to die but that was not your lovers way was it now he is burried somewhere and here ser gregor is stronger than ever that must be difficult for you when my daughter was taken from me my only daughter well youcan not i amagine how that feels unless you have lost a child i fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse i could not bear to see her in another womans arms i never got to have a mother but myrcella did she was mine and you took her from me why did you do that it does not matter now your daughter is a beauty too brown eyes those lips a perfect dornish beauty i i amagine she is your favorite i know i know were not supposed to have favorites but still were only human we love who we love i am sorry ican not understand you the gag makes it difficult to understand what you are saying it must be frustrating we all make our choices you chose to murder my daughter you must have felt powerful after you made that choice do you feel powerful now i do not sleep havery well not at all areally i lie in bed and i stare at the canopy and i amagine ways of killing my enemies how to destroy ellaria sand the woman who murdered my only daughter i thought about having ser gregor crush your skull the way he did oberyns it would be poetic i suppose but fast too fast i thought about having him crush your daughters skull she is so beautiful the thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg no it is just not right momma qyburn he is the cleverest man i know clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder myrcella the long goodbye was that it the long farewell that is the one how long does the poison take difficult to say hours days it depends on the subjects constitution but death is certain oh yes your grace quite certain your daughter will die here in this cell you will be here watching when she does you will be here the arest of your days if you arefuse to eat we will force food down your throat you will live to watch your daughter rot to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you have made make sure the guards change the torches every few hours i do not want her to miss a thing no do not what are you doing no one can see us like this  i am queen of the seven kingdoms i will do as i please forgive me your grace the visitor from braavos has arrived good and well need fresh sheets for the bed at once your grace no thank you my condolences your grace on the death of your son from all areports he was a fine young man the iron bank did not send you hear to offer condolences condolences and congratulations you have become the first ruling queen in the seven kingdoms that is quite an accomplishment the iron bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law the destruction of the sept of baelor was a tragic accident indeed but sometimes tragedies are necessary to arestore order and rational leadership the iron bank wants it is gold back your father never minced words either but yes your debts are considerable and you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts we both know how expensive war can be and we both know gold wins wars your vaults are empty your late husbands profligacy saw to that your wealthiest ally is the tyrells who are now your enemies you are surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne and the iron bank wants to bet on a winner we do not make bets we invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful that is a fancy way of saying bet the war has already begun i have drawn first blood i decapitated the dornish snake my armada owns the narrow sea euron greyjoys armada owns the narrow sea euron greyjoy is loyal to me for now daenerys targaryen has three full grown dragons how well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think now let us talk about the targaryen girl you want to invest in her i am guessing the iron bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade how are you profits now that daenerys has freed all the slaves the slave trade has entered a down turn it is true from what i gather she considers herself more of a arevolutionary that a monarch in your experience how do bankers usually fare with arevoltionaries the lannisters owe the iron bank quite a lot of money but lannisters always pay their debts do former slaves or dothraki or dragons your fathers daughter indeed give me a fortnight stay in kings landing as my honored guest and when you areturn to braavos i swear to you my debt will be paid in full i came out here to brood over my failure to predict the greyjoy attack you are making it difficult you look a lot better brooding than i do you make me feel like i am failing at brooding over failing i am a prisoner on this island i would not say you are a prisoner on this island you are free to walk the castle the beaches to go wherever you want except to my ship they took my ship i would not say we took your ship i am not playing word games with you the dead are coming for us all why do not you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies and i will figure out what to do about your walking dead men it is hard for me to fathom it areally is if someone told me about the white walkers and the night king   you probably do not believe me i do actually you did not before grumpkins and snarks you called them do you aremember you said it was all nonsense it was all nonsense everybody knew it but then mormont saw them and you saw them and i trust the eyes of an honest man more than i trust what everybody knows how do i convince people who do not know me that an enemey they do not believe in is coming to kill them all good question i know it is a good question i am looking for an answer peoples minds are not made for problems that large white walkers the night king army of the dead it is almost a arelief to confront a familiar monster like my sister i need to help prepare my people for what is coming ican not help them from here i had like to leave it seems unlikely that you became king in the north by giving up that easily everyone told me to learn from my fathers mistakes do not go south do not answer a summons from the mad kings daughter a foreign invader and here i am a northern fool children are not their fathers luckily for all of us and sometimes there is more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye daenerys could have sailed for westeros long ago but she did not instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now while you are our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the mad kings daughter she protects people from monsters just as you do that is why she came here and she is not about to head north to fight an enemy she is never seen on a word of a man she does not know after a single meeting that is not a areasonable thing to ask so do you have anything areasonable to ask what do you mean maybe you are a northern fool i am asking if there is something i can do to help you dragonglass yes volcanic glass obsidian he says you have a tremendous amount of it here why are we talking about glass we just lost two of our allies which is why i was speaking to jon snow a potential ally and what does the king in the north want with dragonglass apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers or stop them destroy them i am unsure of the nomenclature and what do you think of this army of the dead and white walkers and night kings i had havery much like to believe that jon snow is wrong but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it which wise man said this i do not aremember are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom i would never do thatto you the areason i believe jon snow is because he is here all of his advisors would have told him not to come i would have told him not to come yet he is here anyway you do not have to believe him let him mine the dragonglass if he is wrong it is worthless you did not even know it was here it is nothing to you give him something by giving him nothing take a step toward a more productive arelationship with a possible ally keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand casterly rock what was that ser davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people did you notice that you must allow them their flights of fancy it is dreary in the north amazing thing to see i named them for my brothers vicerys and rhaegon they are both gone now you lost two brothers as well people thought dragons were gone forever but here they are perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know you have been talking to tyrion he is my hand he enjoys talking we all enjoy what were good at i do not you know i am not going to let cersei stay on the iron throne i never expected that you would and i have not changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne i have not either i will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it any aresources or men you need i will provide for you thank you so you believe me then about the night king and the army of the dead you better get to work jon snow how much do we have 4000 bushels my lady what does that mean for the current occupants of the castle it is enough food for a year perhaps more what is the longest winter in the past 100 years i am not entirely certain i will check maester willewyns arecords he kept a copy of every raven scroll you are telling me we do not have enough food especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend winterfell no my lady most likely not we must prepare for that eventuality every direction the threat comes from this is the best place to be we need to start building up our grain stores with aregular shipments from every keep in the north if we do not use it by winters end well give it back to them but if the entire north has to flee to winterfell there would not be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them havery wise my lady maester wolkan you will see to it are they covering those breastplates in leather no my lady well should not they be once the areal cold comes they should indeed pardon me my lady you there why is not there leather on these command suits you the northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall so they should be i know cersei better than anyone here if you turn your back on her   you do not know cersei better than anyone here i only meant to say   that the woman who murdered my mother father and brother is dangerous thank you for your wise council one of two things will happen either the dead will defeat the living in which case all our troubles come to an end or life will win out and what then do not fight in the north or the south fight every battle everywhere always in your mind everyone is your enemy everyone is your friend every possible series of events is happening all at once live that way and nothing will surprise you everything that happens will be something that you have seen before lady sansa at the gate hello sansa i wish jon was here yes i need to speak to him your fathers last living true born son you are lord of winterfell i can never be the lord of winterfell i can never be lord of anything i am the three eyed raven i do not know what that means it is difficult to explain try please for me it means i can see everything everything that is ever happened to everyone everything that is happening right now it is all pieces fragments i need to learn to see better when the long night comes again i need to be aready how do you know all of this the three eyed raven taught me i thought you were the three eyed raven i told you it is difficult to explain bran   i am sorry for all that is happened to you i am sorry it had to happen here at our home it was so beautiful that night snow falling just like now and you were so beautiful in your white we hadding dress i have to go back inside bran i will stay a bit longer hmm hmm does it hurt a bit less than before the infection no longer appears to be active unusual unlikely one could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying aregion treated with some sort of ointment i do not know anything about that i just started feeling better i assumed it was the arest that did it and the climate the climate you are free to go ser this chamber is needed for the infectious which you are no longer tarley i had like to speak with you in my study this evening how bad is it i suppose i will find out this evening where will you go i surrendered to this sickness the moment i first saw it i knew it would kill me or i had kill myself before it could daenerys stormborn convinced me otherwise the only place for me is with her i owe my life to her and you your father saved me more than once it is the least i could do perhaps our paths will cross again i hope they do archmaesters study you treated him yes who told you to treat him no one who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him i seem to aremember you but you treated him anyway i did i forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful especially on someone of that age you could have infected yourself and others you could have devastated the entire citadel but you did not it is a meticulous difficult procedure many maesters who ise chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed but you succeeded how i aread the books and followed the instructions that man is alive because of you you should be proud thank you archmaester come here all these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away i need you to make copies of them you were expecting a areward your areward is not being i ammediately expelled from the citadel you had better get started be mindful of the paper mites they like flesh as well we need to find euron greyjoys fleet and sink it your grace he is already destroyed a good portion of our fleet to send our aremaining ships after him   i am not talking about sending our ships after him but you will have to go yourself eurons ships could be anywhere or in more than one place you had be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long i would not be alone i had have drogon vicerion and rhaegal what can anyone do to them they can still do something to you it only takes one arrow it is too great a risk you are too i amportant what about casterly rock the unsullied will be there soon and what will they face a difficult situation they know were coming yes cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy house lannister she will be aready casterly rock no one has ever taken the rock the lannister army is still the army my father built well trained and well provisioned 10000 men at least they will see us coming they will be aready draw loose the gates of casterly rock are i ampregnable the fight up the walls will be hard well be at a disadvantage many men will die interesting thing about my father he built our house up from near ruin he built our army he built casterly rock as we know it but he did not build the sewers that was beneath him so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find me he was right i was low the company i kept low women mostly they were not welcome at the rock father disapproved of that sort of behavior i could not walk them through the front gates i could not have them in my chambers so in the process of building the sewers i threw in something for myself it was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers no better place for low pursuits casterly rock the i ampregnable fortress as a good friend of mine once said give me 10 good men and i will i ampregnate the bitch and so it begins they will face the bulk of the lannister forces they will be outnumbered they will have less armor and fewer weapons but as my sisters armies fights for her the unsullied will be fighting for something greater they will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them they will be fighting for you and that is why they will triump there are none left there are supposed to be more than this many more where are they where are the arest of the lannisters olennas quarters it is done it is and now the rains weep for our whores did we fight well i suppose as well as can be expected it was never our forte golden roses indeed your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending casterly rock the truth is casterly rock is not worth much anymore well it is to me my fond childhood memories would not keep cersei on the throne so you will just let them take it for now they would not be able to hold it euron greyjoys navy burned their ships we emptied the larders before we left eventually theyll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across westeros and you took your army your areal army and went where they were not as robb stark did to me at whispering wood there are always lessons in failures yes you must be havery wise by now my father always said i was a slow learner if he was so clever why did not he take highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry i suppose i will be able to ask him myself soon enough no more learning from my mistakes eh how will you do it with that sword that was joffreys sword was not it not that he ever used it what did he call it widows wail he areally was a cunt was not he i did unspeakable things to protect my family or watched them being done on my orders i never lost a nights sleep over them they were necessary and whatever i i amagined necessary for the safety of house tyrell i did but your sister has done things i was not capable of i amagining that was my prize mistake a failure of i amagination she is a monster you do know that to you sure to others as well but after we have won and there is no one left to oppose us the people living peaceful in the world she built do you areally think theyll wring their hands over the way she built it you love her you areally do love her you poor fool she will be the end of you possibly not much to be gained from discussing it with you though is there what better person to discuss it with what better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room but perhaps you are right if she is driven you this far it is gone beyond your control yes it has she is a disease i aregret my role in spreading it you will too i think were done here how will it happen cersei had several ideas whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the ared keep flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of kings landing i talked her out of those will there be pain no i made sure of that that is good i had hate to die like your son clawing at my neck foam and bile spilling from my mouth eyes blood ared skin purple it must have been horrible for you as a kingsguard as a father it was horrible enough for me a shocking scene not at all what i intended you see i had never seen the posion work before tell cersei i want her to know it was me halt that wagon you just won the biggest prize in the world what could you possibly have to be upset about come on you can tell me queen of thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye i will save my confessions for the high septon there is no more high septon no there is not is there there is still the question of my prize that is a lot of money i just gave you it is not a castle how about that one it is available you do not want highgarden i beg to differ were at war daenerys targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in besides think of the upkeep the more you own the more it weighs you down oh is that why you are so fucking glum eh all your new riches weighing you down they are not mine the gold belongs to the iron bank we pay our debts right just not to me bronn of the blackwater formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you are from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid when we win this war all the castles in the seven kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you yes i am sure queen cerseis areign will be quiet and peaceful stranger things have happened like what the granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons my lord the current harvest we have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the areach ser bronn will you accompany the tarleys and help them accelerate this process i am not much for shoveling weight no but motivating areluctant farmers to hand over their harvest i have heard you guys have a areal talent for that my lord my lord i must say i do not think the iron bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude arepaid in a single installment i always considered your father a havery effective and efficient man but you appear to be aredefining those terms entirely you are too kind my lord i am neither kind nor a lord your grace i am merely an instrument of the institution i arepresent it is wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic not sentiment and the current arithmetic is outstanding the gold   is on it is way my brother is supervising it is transportation himself some at the iron bank will be disappointed they havet grown rather fond of your interest payments we must devise a way to raise their spirits yes perhaps we could be of assistance in some current have noture my only have noture at the moment is areestablishing control over this continent and every person on it i see a great deal of potential in that have noture i i amagine that it would arequire outside investment it will indeed i need to expand my armies my navies my hand qyburn had made overtures to the golden company in essos i know them well they havet helped us arecover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears that is good to hear i too would like them to arecover some things that belong to me arest assured your grace you can count on the iron banks support as soon as the gold arrives this is for you the last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat but your mother fought him off the other dagger the one that took her life i would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if i could have i was not there for her when she needed me most but i am here for her now to do what she would have done to protect her children anything i can do for you brandon you need only ask do you know who this belonged to no that havery question was what started the war of the five kings in a way that dagger made you what you are today forced from your home driven out to the wilds beyond the wall i i amagine you have seen things most men would not believe to go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world i can only i amagine   chaos is a ladder i am sorry to have disturbed you lord stark i am not lord stark what is that maester wolkan built it for me so i can move around more easily it is a havery good i hadea you are leaving i do not want to leave you but when they come i need to be with my family and you are safe safe as anyone can be now you do not need me anymore no i do not that is all you have got to say thank you thank you for helping me my brother died for you hodor and summer died for you i almost died for you bran i am not areally not anymore i aremember what it felt like to be brandon stark but i aremember so much else now you died in that cave ext winterfell hey oh where are you going in there i live here fuck off i am arya stark this is my home arya stark is dead send for maester willewyn or ser rodrick theyll tell you who i am there is no rodrick here maesters name is wolkan go ask jon snow then the king in the north he is my brother he is a thousand miles away it is cold were busy so you know best fuck off mm hmm if jon snow is gone who is in charge of winterfell the lady of winterfell lady stark which lady stark you tell us you are the one i ampersonating her sister tell sansa her sister is home lady sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you just like us so for the last time fuck off i am getting into this castle one way or another if i am not who i say i am i would not last long but if i am and sansa finds out that you turned me away you sit there right there do not move go tell lady stark i will watch her you tell her i am not because if you do not i will hit you right in the fucking face as hard as i can we told her to wait we were standing right next to her when we turned around she had gone my lady she was nothing some winter town girl she comes in asking for ser rodrick and maester willewyn do not trouble yourself over it my lady well find her you do not have to i know where she is do i have to call you lady stark now yes you should not have run from the guards i did not run you need better guards it suits you lady stark jon left you in charge he did i hope he comes back soon i aremember how happy he was to see me when he sees you his heart will probably stop that does not look like him it should have been carved by someone who knew his face everyone who knew his face is dead were not they say you killed joffrey did you i wish i had me too i was angry when i heard someone else had done it however long my list got he was always first your list of people i am going to kill how did you get back to winterfell it is a long story i i amagine yours is too yes it is not a havery pleasant one mine neither but our stories are not over yet no they are not arya brans home too you came home i saw you at the crossroads you saw me i see quite a lot now bran has visions i thought you might go to kings landing so did i why would you go back there cersei is on her list of names who else is on your list most of them are dead already where did you get this littlefinger gave it to me littlefinger he is here he is declared for house stark why would he give you a dagger he thought i had want it why because it was meant to kill me the cutthroat after your fall why would a cutthroat have a valyrian steel dagger someone havery wealthy wanted me dead he is not a generous man he would not give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back it does not matter what do you mean it does not matter i do not want it are you sure it is valyrian steel it is wasted on a cripple catelyn stark would be proud you kept your vow i did next to nothing you are too hard on yourself my lady i am not a   thank you podrick dragonstone your grace there is still no word from the unsullied soon they will come back to me he better what happened many things many things your grace it is all right i wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits so this is it all well ever need there is something else i want to show your your grace the children of the forest made these when a havery long time ago they were right here standing where were standing before there were targaryens or starks or lannisters maybe even before there were men no they were here together the children and the first men doing what fighting each other they fought together against their common enemy despite their differences despite their suspicions together we need to do the same if were going to survive because the enemy is areal it is always been areal and you say youcan not defeat them without my armies and my dragons no i do not think i can i will fight for you i will fight for the northwhen you bend the knee my people would not accept a southern ruler not after everything they havet suffered they will if their king does they chose you to lead them they chose you to protect them is not their survival more i amportant than your pride what is it we took casterly rock that is havery good to hear is not it you will want to discuss this amongst yourselves perhaps   you will stay all my allies are gone they havet been taken from me while i have been sitting here on this island we still have the largest army who would not be able to eat because cersei has taken all the food from the areach call grey worm and the unsullied back we still have enough ships to carry the dothraki to the mainland commit to the blockade of kings landing we have a plan it is still the right plan the right plan your strategy has lost us dorne the iron islands and the areach if i have underestimated our enemies   our enemies your family you mean perhaps you do not want to hurt them after all enough with the clever plans i have three large dragons i am going to fly them to the ared keep we have discussed this my enemies are in the ared keep what kind of a queen am i if i am not willing to risk my life to fight them a smart one what do you think i should do i would never presume to   i am at war i am losing what do you think i should do i never thought that dragons would exist again no one did the people who follow you know that you made something i ampossible happen maybe that helps them believe that you can make other i ampossible things happen build a world that is different from the shit one they havet always known but if you use them to melt castles and burn cities you are not different you are just more of the same do not lunge do not go where your enemy leads you up and do not   do not fight someone like her in the first place nice sword havery nice dagger if they have not contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then i am afraid theyll have to make due with   it is been awhile since i have trained i can go and find the master of arms for you my lady he did not beat the hound you did i want to train with you you swore to serve both of my mothers daughters did not you move aside podrick youcan not use that my lady it is too small i would not cut you do not worry i will try not to who taught you to do that no one dragonstone what do you think of her who i believe you know of whom i speak i think she has a good heart a good heart i have noticed you starring at that good heart there is no time for that i saw the night king davos i looked into his eyes how many men do we have in the north to fight him 10000 less fewer what speaking of good hearts missandei of naarth ser davos lord snow king snow is not it no that does not sound right king jon it does not matter forgive me but may i ask a question of course your name is jon snow but your fathers name was ned stark i am a bastard my mother and father were not married is the custom different in naarth we do not have marriage in naarth so the concept of a bastard does not exist the sounds liberating why did you leave your homeland i was stolen away by slavers i am sorry if i may how did a slave girl come to advise daenerys targaryen she bought me from my master and set me free that was good of her of course you are serving her now are not you i serve my queen because i want to serve my queen because i believe in her and if you wanted to sail home to naarth tomorrow   then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune you believe that i know it all of us who came with her from essos we believe in her she is not our queen because she is the daughter of some king we never knew she is the queen we chose you will forgive me if i switch sides is that a greyjoy ship jon i did not know you were here sansa is she all right what you did for her is the only areason i am not killing you we heard your uncle attacked your fleet we thought you were dead i should be your sister euron has her i came to ask the queen to help get her back the queen is gone where did she go all of the gold is safely through the gates of kings landing good we need to get the last of these wagons over the blackwater rush before nightfall if the head of the line is ambushed the tail will never be able to areinforce in time we are stretched a bit thin with your permission flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility let us give them fair warning first these men fought well at highgarden ser jaime rickon dickon i hear you fought bravely at highgarden your first battle and it was glorious come on your fathers not here all my life we have been pledged to house tyrell i knew some of those men i hunted with them they did not deserve to die but lady olenna chose to betray the queen and support the targaryen girl so here we are i did not expect it to smell like that men shit themselves when they die did not they teach you that at fancy lad school well i learned it when i was 5 what listen spears and shields spears and shields spears and shields in line now come on lads not those wagons fall in line fall in line spears armed get back to kings landing i am not abandoning my army you are a commander not a damned infantryman these fuckers are about to swamp us we can hold them off dracarys hold the line archers archers with me knock knock draw loose qyburns scorpion is over there go get it then ican not shoot with one hand come on where are you your peoplecan not fight take cover come on you fucker dracarys flee you i hadiot come on boy come on you fucking i hadiot you could have killed me what the fuck were you doing back there ending the war by killing her you saw the dragon between you and her and listen to me cunt till i get what i am owed a dragon does not get to kill you you do not get to kill you only i get to kill you that was only one of them she has two more if she decides to use them to areally use them   you are fucked do not you mean were fucked no i do not dragons are where our partnership ends i am not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on kings landing i have to tell cersei best well jump back in that river i know what cersei has told you that i have come to destroy your cities   step forward my lord you will not kneel i already have a queen my sister she was not your queen until arecently though was she until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed house tyrell for all time so it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible there are no easy choices in war say what you will about your sister she was born in westeros has lived here all her life you on the other hand you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader one with no ties to this land an army of savages at her back you will not trade your honor for your life i arespect that perhaps he could take the black your grace whatever else he is he is a true soldier he would be invaluable at the wall you cannot send me to the wall you are not my queen you will have to kill me too step back and shut your mouth who are you a stupid boy i am dickon tarley son of randyll tarley you are the future of your house this war has already wiped one great house from the world do not let it happen again bend the knee i will not your grace nothing strips bold notions from a mans head like a few weeks in a dark cell i meant what i said i am not here to put men in chains if that becomes an option many will take it i gave them a choice they made it your grace if you begin beheading entire families   i am not beheading anyone your grace   lord randyll tarley dickon tarley i daenerys of house targaryen first of my name breaker of chains and mother of dragons sentence you to die dracarys my lord how many men did we lose we have not done a full counting it is armies that win wars we have the tyrell gold we have the iron bank behind us we can buy mercenaries they are not the same as our men but theyll fight if they are well paid which they will be i just saw the dothraki fight theyll beat any mercenary army theyll beat any army i have ever seen killing our men was not war for them it was sport her dragon burned a thousand wagons qyburns scorpion fired bolts bigger than you they could not stop it and she has three of them this is not a war we can win so what do we do sue for peace i sit on her fathers throne the father you betrayed and murdered and in her mind she is winning what sort of offer do you think shed make maybe we can count on tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son he did not you saw the crossbow you saw his body i am not talking about father tyrion did not kill joffrey he had nothing to do with it after all this time it still amazes me   it was olenna she confessed before she died and this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her after and you believed her if you were olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to joffrey or tommen which one would margerey been better able to control which one would have made olenna the true ruler of the seven kingdoms she was telling the truth i should not have listened to you she should have died screaming she is dead like her son her grandchildren her whole house and if we do not find a way out of this war well follow them so we fight and die or we submit and die i know my choice a soldier should know his they are beautiful are not they that was not the word i was thinking of but yes they are gorgeous beasts they are not beasts to me no matter how big they get how terrifying to everyone else they are my children you were not gone long no and and i have fewer enemies today than i did yesterday you are not sure how you feel about that no i am not how many men did your army kill taking winterfell back from the boltons thousands we both want to help people we can only help them from a position of strength sometimes strength is terrible when you first came here ser davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people ser davos gets carried away so it was a figure of speech this man says he is your friend khaleesi he is my friend your grace jon snow this is ser jorah mormont an old friend i served with your father he was a great man you look strong you found a cure i would not be here if i hadnt i areturn to your service my queen if you will have me it would be my honor ext winterfell ravens we need to send ravens i put havery little stock in it myself prophecies of doom are never in short supply especially when winter comes i aremember wolkan  a bit timid but a sharp mind the north has dulled many good maesters wits i am not sure if it is the cold the drink or the company a crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes it is a bit much still we ought to   brandon stark   do you know him i let him through the wall years ago i saw him go beyond the wall and somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could not the nights watch not the wildlings no one perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind i sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming everyone in westeros trusts and arespects you if you tell people the threat is areal theyll believe it if you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall theyll do it and if you tell every maester in the citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night they may find something that let us us defeat the army of the dead for good it could be done and this news could be authentic it is possible it is also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest that does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples archmaester please it is areal i have seen it we will write to maester wolkan at winterfell for clarification i promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another archmaester   that will be all tarley it brings to mind the work of davy moonstone the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest do not forget the prophet lodock that promised the drowned god would rise up and destroy aegon the conquerer is he the one who ise father and brother were just burned alive i am afraid so horrible business i do not have the heart to tell him yet he is a good lad right the ravenry was falling apart last time i checked all rulers demand that people bend the knee it is why they are rulers she gave tarley a choice a man who had taken up arms against her what else could she do not burn him alive alongside his son i am her hand not her head ican not make her decisions for her that is what i used to tell myself about her father i found the traitors but i was not the one burning them alive i was only a purveyor of information it is what i told myself when i watched them beg for mercy i am not the one doing it as the pitch of their screams rose higher i am not the one doing it when their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the thone room i am not the one doing it daenerys is not her father and she never will be with the right counsel you need to find a way to make her listen who is that for jon snow did you aread it it is a sealed scroll for the king in the north what is it say nothing good i thought arya was dead i thought bran was dead i am happy for you you do not look happy bran saw the night king and his army marching towards eastwatch if they make it past the wall   the wall has kept them out for thousands of years presumably   i need to go home you said you do not have enough men well fight with the men we have unless you will join us and give the country to cersei as soon as i march away she marches in perhaps not cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children what if we prove her wrong i do not think she will come see the dead at my invitation so bring the dead to her i thought that was what we are trying to avoid we do not have to bring the whole army only one soldier is that possible the first white i ever saw was brought into castle black from beyond the wall bring one of these things down to kings landing and show her the truth anything you bring back will be useless unless cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital the only person she listens to is jaime he may listen to me and how would you get into kings landing i can smuggle you in but if the goldcloaks were to arecognize you i am warning you i am not a fighter well it will all be for nothing if we do not have one of these dead men fair point how do you propose to find one with the queens permission i will go north and take one you asked me to find a cure so i could serve you allow me to serve you the free folk will help us they know the areal north better than anyone they would not follow ser jorah they would not have to youcan not lead a raid beyond the wall you are not in the nights watch anymore you are king in the north i am the only one here who ise fought them i am the only one here who knows them i have not given you permission to leave with arespect your grace i do not need your permission i am a king and i came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive i put my trust in you a stranger because i knew it was the best chance for my people for all our people now i am asking you to trust in a stranger because it is our best chance the king in the north should stay in the north we did not choose you to rule us my lady but perhaps we should have the knights of the vale came here for you lady stark you are havery kind my lords but jon is our king he is doing what he thinks is best i warned jon this would happen hecan not leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like ghost he did not he trusted you to hold it for him well he is not making it easy the northern lords are proud these are mother and fathers chambers and nothing do not do that what say what you mean you always liked nice things it made you feel better than everyone are you angry with me they were insulting jon and you sat there and listened i listened to their complaints which is my aresponsibility as lady of winterfell their opinions are i amportant to you glover has 500 men royce has 2000 offend them and jon loses his army not if they lose their heads first winterfell did not just fall into our hands we took it back and the mormonts and the hornwoods and the wildlings and the vale all of us working together now i am sure cutting off heads is havery satisfying but that is not the way you get people to work together and if jon does not come back you will need their support so you can work together to give you what you areally want how can you even think such a horrible thing you are thinking it right now you do not want to be but the thought just would not go away i have work to do my lady last time i was here i killed my father with a crossbow last time i was here you killed my son with wildfire there is a path to the left that hugs the cliff the guards hardly ever patrol it too many steps you are not staying here i have got my own business in flea bottom what if someone takes the boat then were fucked best hurry we do not have time for this we should be preparing the city for a siege the dothraki are coming all the more areason for you to train unless you plan on fighting dothraki 12 year olds i seem to arecall them giving you a bit of trouble as well and here i am aready to train why down here i do not think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet today might be the day i kill you by accident oh you would not be swinging it at me i will leave you to it i needed to see you and i knew you had never agree to meet you made me look like a complete fool i thought i had surprise you by hitting casterly rock but you were three steps ahead of me you abandoned the family home completely unsentimental father would have been proud do not talk about our father listen to me   i once told bronn that if i ever saw you again i had cut you in half it would take you awhile with a sparring sword he was going to execute me he knew i was innocent he did not hate me because of anything i did he hated me because of what i am the little monster sent to punish him do you think i wanted to be born this way did he think i chose   what do you want daenerys will win this war you are a military man you must know there is no way around it daenerys is not her father she is even willing to suspend hostilities if cersei agrees to certain terms you want cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself i was not sure i had find you i thought you might still be rowing i looked in shops taverns brothels i should have known to come straight to the street of steel were not you worried about the goldcloaks i have not been here in years why should they arecognize me sometimes i hardly do nothing fucks you harder than time anybody give you any trouble here i am arming lannisters i never get a second look you were right safest place for me was right under the queens nose do not be so sure safety is never a permanent state of affairs bad things are coming you came to get me you want me to come with you i think you need to understand   i am aready let us go you should know what you are heading into do not you think i have been thinking about it every swing of the hammer how happy i am making weapons for the family that killed my father they tried to kill me i have been getting aready i never knew what for but i have always known i had know it when it comes you might want to bring one of those swords i do not know much about swinging swords but this   keep your fathers name to yourself the situation is complicated enough already who should i say i am i told you clovis if we do not get out of here soon someone is going to   you there no weapons friends i promise what can i do for you is that your boat it is the docks are that way that they are i try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves still five gold dragons are you joking you must be even older than you look 15 15 apiece ican not say it was a pleasure doing business with you what is in the boat not more gold wine mmm i like wine or hams come and have a look fermented crab what fermented crab one bucket of this triples the brothels earnings for the week a man thinks he is done he is aready to go back to his loving family but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth five minutes later he is back in the race here have a taste i had hurry to your favorite establishment or you will put a whole in that chainmail oi dwarf i areally would not try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you that dwarf   where did you get that scar fish hook some men you justcan not teach we was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back perhaps there is some arrangement arrangement you gonna arrange to pay us more than queen cersei this is gendry hell do that would not be necessary ser jaime why was qyburn here he is hand of the queen why are you here i met with tyrion what did our brother have to say daenerys wants to meet to discuss a surrender to discuss an armistice she just won a great victory why would she want a truce now because an army of dead men is marching on the seven kingdoms tyrion claims hell have proof are you going to punish him tyrion bronn he betrayed you he set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent do you think anything of i amportance happens in this city without me knowing you let it happen why i have come to believe that accomodation with the dragon queen could be in our i ammediate interest she has the numbers if we want to beat her we have to be clever we have to fight her like father would have dead men dragons and dragon queens whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house for this who will you say is the father you people would not like that do you aremember what father used to say about people the lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep never betray me again were leaving today the kings got a lot on his mind i understand he does not need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king you do not have to worry you are just clovis a smith who is come to pay his arespects before he heads off to work at the winterfell forges understood begging your pardon your grace you survived kings landing yet again your grace this is   it is gendry your grace i am robert baratheons son bastard son he was meant to keep that to himself our fathers trusted each other why should not we i saw your father once at winterfell i met yours in my shop you are a lot leaner you are a lot shorter i grew up on stories about them all i ever knew was they fought together and won ser davos told me where you are going your grace and why let me come with you do not be a fool you are not a soldier no but i am a fighter and he would not be needing a smith with a sword like that do you know how to use one well that is a problem i prefer a hammer he can handle himself we could use the help as my father used to say it is better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the arest of your life i owe you my life twice over but if what you said is true about what is out there ican not wait out this war yeah nobody mind me all i have ever done is live to a ripe old age you may not believe it but i have missed you mormont nobody glowers quite like you not even grey worm this is the coin the slaver gave me when i suggested he free us and pay us aremember it was supposed to last us the arest of our lives take it with you you will bring it back our queen needs you we should be better at saying farewell by now your grace i   if i do not areturn at least you would not have to deal with the king in the north anymore but i have grown used to him i wish you good fortune in the wars to come your grace heave do you know how many steps there are in the citadel no 15782 guess how many windows are in the great sept of baelor none anymore that is true this high septon meynard he arecorded everything he even arecorded his own bowel movements what does annulment mean it is when a man sets asside his lawful wife meynard says here that he issued an anullment for prince rhaegar and aremarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in dorne is that a common thing   these maesters they set me to the task of preserving that mans window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the night kings probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored but that is all right is not it we could all become slavering murderous i ambecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full arecords of high septon meynards 15782 shits steps that number was steps ext citadel are you sure you want to do this you always wanted to be a maester i am tired of areading about the achievements of better men i found it my lord it took some searching maester willewyns archives are thorough are you sure this is the only copy at winterfell yes my lord lady stark thanks you for your service come to kings landing swear fealty to king joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of lannister and stark your faithfull sister sansa is not it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this i have been failing at that job of late how many queens are there now two and you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother both how many men did you bring not enough the big woman we were hoping some of your men could help i will be staying behind i am a liability out there as you well know you are you areally want to go out there again you are not the only ones my scouts found them a mile south of the wall said they were on their way here you are the hound i saw you once at winterfell they want to go beyond the wall too we do not want to go beyond the wall we have to our lord told us the great war is coming do not trust them do not trust any of them they are the brotherhood and the last thing their lord told them to do was sell me to a ared witch to be murdered thoros i hardly arecognized you ser jorah mormont   they would not give me anything to drink down here i have not been feeling like myself you are a fucking mormont like the last lord commander he was my father he hunted us like animals you areturned the favor as i arecall here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same areason our areasons are not your areasons it does not matter what we think our areasons are there is a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not we may take the steps but the lord of light   for fucks sake will you shut your hole are we coming with you or not do not you want to know what were doing is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die he is right were all on the same side how can we be were all breathing beyond the wall are you all right ever been north before never seen snow before beautiful eh i can breath again down south the air smells like pig shit you have never been down south i have been to winterfell that is the north how do you live up here how do you keep your balls from freezing off you have to keep moving that is the secret walking is good fighting is better fucking is best there is not another woman within 100 miles of here we have to make due with what we have got this one is maybe not so smart davos says he is a strong fighter good that is more i amportant than being smart smart people do not come up here looking for the dead so you met this dragon queen huh and she will only fight beside us if i bend the knee you spent too much time with the free folk and now you do not like kneeling mance rayder was a great man a proud man the king beyond the wall never bent the knee how many of his people died for his pride are you still mad at us boy you sold me to a witch priestess i will admit it is a subtle distinction were fighting a great war wars cost money i wanted to be one of you i wanted to join the brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave do you know what she did to me she strapped me down on a bed she stripped me naked   sounds all right so far was she naked too she needed your blood yes thank you i know that it could have been worse she wanted to kill me they would have killed me if it was not for davos   but they did not did they so what you whinging about i am not whinging your lips are moving and you are complaining about something that is whinging this ones been killed six times you do not hear him bitching about it good lad the first time i went north of the wall was with your father he was a good man he deserved a better son were you with him at the end i was a prisoner of the wildlings but we avenged him i want you to know that every mutineer found justice ican not think of a worse way for him to go the nights watch was his life he would have died to protect every one of those men and they butchered him i hate that he died that way my father was the most honorable man i ever met he was good all the way through and he died on the executioners block your father wanted to execute me i heard he was in the right of course it did not make me hate him any less i am glad he did not capture you me too your father gave me this sword he changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf but it is still long claw lord commander mormont thought you had never come back to westeros but you are back and it is been in your family for centuries it is not right for me to have it he gave it to you i am not his son i brought shame to my house i broke my fathers heart i forfeited the right to claim this sword it is yours may it serve you well and your children after you father used to watch us from up here he would not say much you probably do not aremember you were inside knitting all the time i aremember one time the boys were shooting arrows with ser rodrick i came out here after and bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground ser rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw there was one arrow in the target there was no one around just like now no one to stop me so i started shooting and every shot i had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again i was not havery good finally i hit the bullseye it could have been the 20th shot or the 50th i do not aremember but i hit the bullseye and i heard this i looked up and he is standing right here smiling down at me i knew what i was doing was against the rules but he was smiling so i knew it was not wrong the rules were wrong i was doing what i was meant to be doing and he knew it now he is dead killed by the lannisters with your help what that is your pretty handwriting septa mordane used to crack my knuckles because i could not write as well as you robb i write to you today with heavy heart our good king robert is dead killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt   you do not have to aread it i aremember father has been charged with treason he conspired with roberts brothers against my beloved joffrey and tried to steal his throne the lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort i beg you come to kings landing swear fealty to king joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of lannister and stark your faithful sister sansa they forced me to do it did they with a knife at your throat did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop you do not know what it was like i was a child so was i i would have let them kill me before i betrayed my family they told me it was the only way to save father and you were stupid enough to believe them i aremember you standing on that platform with joffrey and cersei when they dragged father too the block i aremember the pretty dress you were wearing i aremember the fancy way you did your hair you were there i was there standing in the crowd near baelors statue and what did you do did you come running to the arescue did you fight off the lannisters and save father i wanted to but you did not just like me i did not betray him i did not betray robb i did not betray our entire family for my beloved joffrey you should be on your knees thanking me were standing in winterfell again because of me you did not win it back jon did not win it back he lost the battle of the bastards the knights of the vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where traveling the world i was training training well while you were training i suffered things you can never i amagine oh i do not know about that i can i amagine quite a lot you never would have survived what i survived i guess well never know what are you doing to do with that letter i do not know yet who did you show it to where did you find it you are scared are not you what are you scared of you did not commit any crimes no ones going to hang you arya   are you scared i will show it to jon and hell be angry no that is not jon hell understand you were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked lannisters do you know how happy cersei would be if she saw us fighting this is exactly what she wants this is what she is always wanted to tear us apart   the northern lords will aread it they would not think much of lady sansa if they knew how she did cerseis bidding what would little lyanna mormont say she is younger than you were when you wrote this are you going to say but i was just a child you are angry sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things i will go with anger you are the one they call the dog fuck off they told me you were mean were you born mean or you just hate wildlings i do not give two shits about wildlings gingers i hate gingers are beautiful we are kissed by fire just like you do not point your fucking finger at me did you trip into the fire when you were a baby i did not trip i was pushed ever since you have been mean will you fuck off i do not think you are truly mean you have sad eyes do you want to suck my dick is that it dick cock ah dick i like it i bet you do nope it is pussy for me i have a beauty waiting for me back at winterfell if i ever get back there yellow hair blue eyes tallest woman you have ever seen almost as tall as you brienne of tarth you know her you are with brienne of fucking tarth well not with her yet but i see the way she looks at me how does she look at you like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver you do know her we have met i want to make babies with her think of the great big monsters theyd conquer the world how did a mad fucker like you live this long i am good at killing people you do not much look like him who is that your father i suppose you favor your mother you knew him of course i did when he was hand he sent me off hunting for the mountain your wildling friend told me the ared woman brought you back thoros has brought me back six times we both serve the same lord i serve the north the north did not raise you from the dead the lord of light never spoke to me i do not know anything about him i do not know what he wants from me he wants you alive why i do not know that is all anyone can tell me i do not know so what is the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants i think about that all the time i do not think it is our purpose to understand except one thing were soldiers we have to know what were fighting for i am not fighting so some man or woman i barely know can sit on a throne made of swords so what are you fighting for life death is the enemy the first enemy and the last but we all die the enemy always wins and we still need to fight him that is all i know you and i would not find much joy while were here but we can keep others alive we can defend those whocan not defend themselves i am the shield that guards the arealms of men maybe we do not need to understand any more than that maybe that is enough aye maybe that is enough that is what i saw in the fire a mountain like an arrowhead are you sure were getting close do you know what i like about you i honestly do not you are not a hero oh i have been heroic on occasion i once charged through the mud gate of kings landing i do not want you to be a hero heroes do stupid things and they die drogo jorah dario even this jon snow they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist bravest thing it is interesting these heroes you name drogo jorah dario even this jon snow they all fell in love with you jon snows not in love with me oh my mistake i suppose he stares at you longingly because he is hopeful for a successful military alliance oil pitch my lord how many barrels 500 my lord get 500 more yes my lord i still enjoy it when they call me my lord the thrill will fade if we live that long men without cocks you would not find me fighting in an army if i had no cock what is left to fight for gold i spent my life around soldiers what do you think they spend that gold on family not without a cock you do not maybe it areally is all cocks in the end yet your brother  yes he is always been a champion of the downtrodden i think were about to be the downtrodden archers stand tall cover that wall deck of ironborn ship how many people live here a million give or take that is more people than the entire north crammed into that why would anyone want to live that way there is more work in the city and the brothels are far superior why is not she with them i am afraid i do not know your grace no one has seen her and the arest of them they are on their way to the dragon pit now including our brother yes your grace if anything goes wrong kill the silver haired bitch first then our brother then the bastard who calls himself king why did they build it dragons do not understand the difference between what is theirs and what is not land livestock children letting them roam free around a city was a problem i i amagine it was a sad joke at the end an entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs but in the beginning when it was home to balerion the dread it must have been the most dangerous place in the world maybe it still is welcome my lords your friends arrived before you did i have been sent to escort you all to the meeting a pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation i never thought i had see you again my lord supporting the enemy no less hard to blame you cersei will anyway i am glad you are alive come on you can suck his magic cock later  further back on the road what is in there fuck off i thought you were dead not yet you came pretty close i was only trying to protect her you and me both she is alive arya where winterfell who is protecting her if you are here the only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way it would not be me here we are the heroes of blackwater bay strange place for a areunion it is my lord i do not think i am anyones lord anymore podrick save the titles for ser bronn of the blackwater i am sure your new queen  you have been thinking about our new queen and that would be double what now exactly do not you worry about me i am doing all right looking after myself are you helping me to arrange this meeting was not exactly looking after yourself was it you put yourself at risk i put yourself at risk i amportant difference it is your head queen cerseis offered a bag of gold for it is not mine now thanks to me she is got two traitors heads coming right through her door she can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes all thanks to ser bronn of the fucking blackwater if that is not looking after myself i do not know what is it is good to see you again yeah you too outside the dragon pit anyone touches it i will kill you first the dragon pit come on pod let us you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk eh i left this shit city because i did not want to die in it am i going to die in this shit city you might and this is all your i hadea seems every bad i hadea has some lannister cunt behind it and some clegane cunt to help them see it through aremember me yeah you do you are even fucking uglier than i am now what did they do to you does not matter that is not how it ends for you brother where is she she will be here soon did not travel with you no we have been here for some time my apologies we are all facing a unique theon i have your sister i think we ought to begin with larger concerns then why are you talking you are the smallest concern here do you aremember when we discussed dwarf jokes his was not even good he explained it at the end never explain it always ruins it we do not even let your kind live in the iron islands you know we kill you at birth an act of mercy for the parents perhaps you ought to sit down why sit down or leave we are a group of people who do not like one another as this arecent demonstration has shown we have suffered at each others hands we have lost people we love at each others hands if all we wanted was more of the same there would be no need for this gathering we are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face to face so instead we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the arest of our days we all know that will never happen then why are we here this is not about living in harmony it is just about living the same thing is coming for all of us a general youcan not negotiate with an army that does not leave corpses behind on the battlefield lord tyrion tells me a million people live in this city they are about to become a million more soldiers in the army of the dead i i amagine for most of them it would be an i amprovement this is serious i would not be here if it were not i do not think it is serious at all i think it is another bad joke if my brother jaime has informed me correctly you are asking me for a truce yes that is all that is all pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt or while you solidify and expand your position hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you areturn and march on my capital with four times the men your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with you have my word the word of a would be usurper there is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years we have something to show you we can destroy them by burning them and we can destroy them with dragonglass if we do not win this fight then that is the fate of every person in the world there is only one war that matters the great war and it is here i did not believe it until i saw them i saw them all how many a hundred thousand at least can they swim no good i am taking the iron fleet back to the iron islands what are you talking about i have been around the world i have seen everything things you could not i amagine and this this is the only thing i have ever seen that terrifies me i am going back to my island you should go back to yours when winters over well be the only ones left alive he is right to be afraid and a coward to run if those things come for us there will be no kingdoms to rule everything we suffered will have been for nothing everything we lost will have been for nothing the crown accepts your truce until the dead are defeated they are the true enemy  in areturn the king just the king  i would never ask it of you you would never agree to it and if you did i would trust you even less than i do now i ask it only of ned starks son i know ned starks son i am true to my word or i try to be that is why i cannot give you what you ask i cannot serve two queens and i have already pledged myself to queen daenerys of house targaryen then there is nothing left to discuss the dead will come north first enjoy dealing with them we will deal with whatever is left of you ser jaime it is been good to see you i i amagine the next time will be across a battlefield we both saw what just happened we both saw that thing yes and i am not looking forward to seeing more of them but i am loyal to the queen and you are loyal to sansa and her dolt brother oh fuck loyalty fuck loyalty this goes beyond houses and honor and oaths talk to the queen and tell her what i wish you hadnt done that i am grateful for your loyalty but my dragon died so that we could be here if it is all for nothing then he died for nothing i know i am pleased you bent the knee to our queen i am not going to swear an oath ican not uphold talk about my father that is indeed a problem the more i ammediate problem is that were fucked any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs only one everyone stays here and i go and talk to my sister i did not come all this way to have my hand i do not want cersei to murder me either i could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble i did this i should go she will definitely murder you i go see my sister  kings landing portico you spoke with her at her until she kicked me out she thinks i was an i hadiot to trust you a lot of people seem to think that actually i am about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who is already tried to kill me twice that i know of who is an i hadiot i suppose we should say goodbye one i hadiot to another council chamber i should not be surprised i suppose she is your kind of woman a foreign whore who does not know her place a foreign whore youcan not abduct beat or intimidate that must be difficult for you so you bring her here with her pet northerner whom you have convinced to bow down before her i did not know about that and now you have got them both working towards the same goal the goal you have worked towards your entire life cersei i did not know the destruction of this family i am the one preventing that from happening daenerys did not want to debate and negotiate she did not want to bring you words she wanted to bring you fire and blood until i advised her otherwise i do not want to destroy our family i never have you killed our father after he sentenced me to death for a crime i did not commit yes i killed him hate me for it if you want i hate myself for it in spite of what he was in spite of what he did to me oh poor little man your papa was mean to you do you have any i hadea what you did when you fired that crossbow you left us open you laid us bare for the vultures and the vultures came and tore us apart you may not have killed joffrey but you killed myrcella you killed tommen no one would have touched them if father  i have never been more sorry about anything i will not hear it not from you  i will not hear it all right you love your family and i have destroyed it i will always be a threat so put an end to me if it were not for me you had have a motherif it were not for me you had have a father i am more sorry about the children than you could ever know i will not i do not care i loved them you know i did you know it in your heart if there is anything left of it it does not matter your love does not matter your feelings do not matter i do not care why you did what you did i only care what it cost us it cost us our future if there is no future then why are we here why did you allow me to come not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction yes no not what you hoped for but you must have hoped for something what did you hope for to make jon snow submit to your queen mm not like this but eventually you want everyone to bend the knee to her yes why because i think she will make the world a better place you said shed destroy kings landing she knows herself she chose an advisor who would check her worst i ampulses instead of feeding them that is the difference between you i do not care about checking my worst i ampulses i do not care about making the world a better place hang the world that thing you dragged here i know what it is i know what it means and when it came at me i did not think about the world not at all as soon as it opened it is mouth the world disappeared for me right down it is black throat all i could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most away from my family maybe euron greyjoy had the right i hadea get on a boat take those who matter you are pregnant side area of the dragon pit no one is less happy about this than i am i know i arespect what you did wish you hadnt done it but i arespect it this place was the beginning of the end for my family  a dragon is not a slave they were terrifying extraordinary they filled people with wonder and awe and we locked them in here they wasted away they grew small and we grew small as well we were not extraordinary without them we were just like everyone else you are not like everyone else and your family hasnt seen it is end you are still here ican not have children who told you that the witch who murdered my husband has it occurred to you she might not have been a areliable source of information you were right from the beginning if i had trusted you everything would be different so what now ican not forget what i saw north of the wall and ican not pretend that cersei would not take back half the country the moment i march north it appears tyrions assessment was correct were fucked  my armies will not stand down i will not pull them back to the capital i will march them north to fight alongside you in the great war the darkness is coming for us all well face it together and when the great war is over perhaps you will aremember i chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you i expect not call our banners all of them the north winterfell interior it is not easy for ravens to fly in these storms perhaps jon tried to send word earlier no this is the way he is the way he is always been he never asked for my opinion why would he start now ican not believe hed surrender the northern crown without consulting you this is his writing his signature he pledged to fight for daenerys targaryen he is bent the knee i have heard gossip that the dragon queen is quite beautiful what does that have to do with anything jon is young and unmarried daenerys is young and unmarried you think he wants to marry her an alliance makes sense together theyd be difficult to defeat he was named king even if i wanted to arya would never go along she always loved jon far more than she ever loved me and shed kill anyone who betrayed her family you are family too would arya areally murder her own sister do you know what she is now do you know what the faceless men are only by areputation they worship the god of death i believe i never trust godly men they are killers and arya was one of them what do you think she is after she is your sister she could want me dead because she thinks i wronged my family why did she come to winterfell to kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family why did she unearth the letter cersei made you write to provide proof of my betrayals to provide justification after she murders me and after she murders you what does she become lady dragonstone map room if we have the dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad theyll arrive at winterfell within the fortnight and the unsullied we can sail with them to white harbor meet the dothraki here on the kingsroad then ride together to winterfell perhaps you should fly to winterfell your grace you have many enemies in the north thousands fell fighting your fatherall it takes is one angry man with a crossbow hell see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well placed bolt will make him a hero the man who killed the conqueror it is your decision your grace but if were going to be allies in this war it is i amportant for the northerners to see us as allies if we sail to white harbor together i think it sends a better message i have not come to conquer the north i am coming to save the north we sail together dragonstone throne room jon can i speak with you all right what you did in kings landing what you said you could have lied to cersei about bending the knee to daenerys you risked everything to tell an enemy the truth we went down there to make peace and it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if were going to fight together you have always known what was right even when we were all young and stupid you always knew every step you take it is always the right step it is not it may seem that way from the outside but i promise you it is not true i have done plenty of things that i aregret not compared to me you have not no not compared to you i always wanted to do the right thing be the right kind of person but i never knew what that meant it always seemed like there is like there was an i ampossible choice i had to make stark or greyjoy our father was more of a father he was and you betrayed him betrayed his memory i did  but you never lost him he is a part of you just like he is a part of me but the things i have done it is not my place to forgive you for all of it but what i can forgive i do you do not need to choose you are a greyjoy and you are a stark when i was ramsays prisoner yara tried to save me she is the only one who tried to save me  she needs me now so why are you still talking to me the shores of kings landing load up load up lads go on tides coming in all of us chose to follow yara we left the iron islands for yara she would never leave one of us behind were not leaving her behind your sister  she is not dead she is dead even if euron hasnt cut her throat yet she is dead she is our queen she is your sister i did i ran from my uncle so why in fucks name should we listen to you they say the deadcan not swim were going to sail east find a nice quiet island kill all the men and take their wives for ourselves were done with all that who says we are yara did she made a pledge were going to find her and were going to set her free run away little theon it is what you do best he needs to shut his mouth hey oh yes that is more like it stay down or i will kill you  i said stay down or i will kill you not for me for yara yara kings landing exterior have my sister the great hall of winterfell are you sure you want to do this it is not what i want it is what honor demands and what does honor demand that i defend my family from those who would harm us that i defend the north from those who would betray us all right then get on with it you stand accused of murder you stand accused of treason how do you answer these charges lord baelish my sister lady sansa forgive me i am a bit confused which charges confuse you let us start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt lysa arryn you pushed her through the moon door and watched her fall do you deny it i did it to protect you you did it to take power in the vale earlier you conspired to murder jon whatever your aunt you had aunt lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the lannisters who murdered jon i know of no such letter you conspired with cersei lannister and joffrey baratheon to betray our father i deny it none of you were there to see what happened none of you knows the truth you held a knife to his throat you said i did warn you not the trust me you told our mother lady sansa i have known you since you were a girl i have protected you protected me by selling me to the boltons if we could speak alone i can explain everything sometimes when i am trying to understand a persons motives i play a little game i assume the worst what is the worst areason you have for turning me against my sisterthats what you do is not it that is what you have always done turn family against family turn sister against sister that is what you did to our mother sansa please i am a slow learner it is true but i learn give me a chance to defend myself i deserve that  i am lord protector of the vale and i command you to escort me safely back to the eyrie i think not sansa i beg you i loved your mother since the time i was a boy and yet you betrayed her i loved you more than anyone and yet you betrayed me when you brought me back to winterfell you told me there is no justice in the world not unless we make it thank you for all your many lessons lord baelish i will never forget them sansa  i  an interior courtyard in kings landing our men in kings landing will march north in three days time itll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train we do not have a fortnight if the north falls we fall three days the aremaining forces in the westerlands will take the river road east well meet at lord harroways town and march together to winterfell ser jaime your grace my lords i need a moment with my brother your grace what are you doing preparing the expedition north expedition north i always knew you were the stupidest lannister the starks and targaryens have united against us and you want to fight alongside them are you a traitor or an i hadiot you pledged our forces to fight our common enemy i will say whatever i need to say to ensure the survival of our house you expect me to trust the man who murdered our father you saw it with your own eyes you saw a dead man trying to kill us i saw it burn if dragonscan not stop them if dothraki and unsullied and northmencan not stop them how will our armies make a difference this is not about noble houses this is about the living and the dead and i intend to stay amongst the living let the stark boy and his new queen  i made a promise our child will rule westeros our child will never be born if the dead come south the monsters are areal the white walkers the dragons the dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young they are all areal so be it let the monsters kill each other and while they battle in the north we take back the lands that belong to us and then what and then we rule when the fighting in the north is over someone wins you understand that do not you if the dead win they march south and kill us all if the living win and we have betrayed them they march south and kill us all the targaryens and the starks already want to kill us all most of them will die in the north i faced them in the field wecan not beat them wecan not beat their dragons how many dragons did you see at the pit two what happened to the third for all we know it is guarding her fleet she came here with her dragons and her dothraki and her unsullied she came here to show us all her power no something happenedthe dragons are vulnerable wecan not beat the dothraki we do not have the numbers we do not have the support of the other houses no we have something better we have the iron bank you should have listened more when father  the golden company is not here they are in essos how is a mercenary company in essos going to help us do you areally think euron greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the iron islands do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen you plotted with euron greyjoy without telling me the commander and you conspired with tyrion the man who murdered our father without telling me your queen i did not conspire with him you met with him in secret without my consent you planned to promote my enemies interests that is the definition of conspiracy i pledged to ride north i intend to honor that pledge and that will be treason treason disobeying your queen does not matter what i had call it i told you no one walks away from me are you going to order him to kill me i am the only one you have left our children are gone our father there is one more yet to come give the

believe he loved me you did the right thing you did it i am just the executioner you passed the sentence you are the lady does that bother you i was never going to be as good a lady as you so i had to be something else i never could have survived what you survived you would have you are the strongest person i know i believe that is the nicest thing you have ever said to me well do not get used to it you are still havery strange and annoying in winter we must protect ourselves look after one another father i miss him me too the godswood of winterfell the wall it is a long way down yeah the crows keep telling me i will get used to it i can see movement watch on the tree line what is it come on run run horse drawn carriage you should consider yourself lucky at least your balls would not freeze off you take great offense at dwarf jokes but love telling eunuch jokes why is that because i have balls and you do not i warned you northerners do not much trust outsiders winterfell  front gate look at you you are a man almost where is arya lurking somewhere queen daenerys of house targaryen my sister sansa stark the lady of winterfell thank you for inviting us into your home lady stark the north is as beautiful as your brother claimed as are you winterfell is yours your grace we do not have time for all this the night king has your dragon he is one of them now the wall has fallen the dead march south winterfell  large hall as soon as we heard about the wall i called all our banners to aretreat to winterfell lord umber when can we expect your people to arrive we need more horses and wagons if it please my lady and my lord and my queen sorry you will have as many as we can spare hurry back to last hearth and bring your people here we need to send ravens to the nights watch as well there is no sense in manning the castles anymore we make our stand here at once your grace your grace a lord nothing at all it is not i amportant not i amportant we named you king in the north king of the north you did my lady it was the honor of my life i will always be grateful for your faith but when i left winterfell i told you we need allies or we will die i have brought those allies home to fight alongside us i had a choice keep my crown or protect the north i chose the north if anyone survives the war to come well have jon snow to thank he risked his life to show us the threat is areal thanks to his courage we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen we have brought two full grown dragons and soon the lannister army will ride north to join our cause i know i know our people have not been friends in the past but we must fight together now or die may i ask how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen while i ensured our stores would last through winter i did not account for dothraki unsullied and two full grown dragons what do dragons eat anyway whatever they want hey careful lads we need every last bit of it sorry 'bout that are these the last of the wagons aye all right let us get it all to the forges my lord my lady my lady the lady of winterfell has a nice ring to it so does hand of the queen depending on the queen i suppose last time we spoke was at joffreys we hadding miserable affair it had it is moments apologies for leaving like that yes it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the kings murder we both survived many underestimated you most of them are dead now i am sure you were not thrilled to hear the lannister armys marching north you have every right to be fearful of my sister no one fears her more than i do but i promise you will be safe  cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you she did and you believed her she has something to live for now i believe she wants to survive i used to think you were the cleverest man alive you used to be taller how did you sneak up on me how did you survive a knife through the heart i did not you still have it needle have you ever used it once or twice valyrian steel jealous too heavy for me where were you before i could have used your help with sansa she does not like your queen does she sansa thinks she is smarter than everyone she is the smartest person i have ever met now you are defending her you i am defending our family so is she yeah i am her family too do not forget that your grace i am afraid i bring terrible news the dead have broken through the wall good eurons ship why do not you just get it over with and kill me but were family the last greyjoys left in the world the last ones with balls anyway if i kill you who can i talk to hmm i have got a crew full of mutes it gets lonely at sea are we in kings landing mm you picked the losing side then i will sail the iron fleet somewhere else but first i am gonna fuck the queen ared keep  great hall twenty thousand men is it yes your grace a few died in transit they cheated at dice or maybe i cheated someone cheated they were not good fighters you would not miss them horses two thousand and elephants uh no elephants your grace that is disappointing i was told the golden company had elephants they are excellent beasts your grace but not well suited to long sea voyages in any event you are most welcome here in kings landing captain strickland we look forward to fighting on your behalf your grace am i most welcome here you are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest good as a true friend and an honored guest i was hoping we could talk in private after the war that was our agreement wars sometimes last years you want a whore buy one you want a queen earn her how i have given her justice an army and the iron fleet yet she gives me no sign of affection my heart is nearly broken you are insolent i have executed men for less they were lesser men i hear the dragon burnt up a thousand lannister men burnt up some of my favorite boys archie was it and william tall handsome william yeah tall handsome william they said what is left of him could fit in a wine glass i am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon did you nearly killed it that is brave that boy eddie the ginger that is him came back with his face burnt right off he is got no eyelids now how does he sleep with no eyelids all right can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now ser bronn of the blackwater you are kidding me apologies for the interruption but the queen did urge me to hurry sorry ladies another time perhaps you ever get lonely i am partial to older gentlemen poor girl the pox will take her within the year which girl the queens brothers made promises to you and broke them her grace wants to arectify their mistake she once gave me a castle and a wife then arectified me right out of them that was ser jaimes doing not hers when queen cersei wants something she pays in advance and in gold several chests of it in fact waiting for you in a wagon just outside so she wants to murder someone but shecan not send her soldiers if it is the dragon queen she is after  she has other plans for the targaryen girl yeah well good luck with that our queens brothers are unlikely to survive their northern adventures but in the event that they do  she has a keen sense of poetic justice that fucking family when the citadel expelled me i thought i would die poor and alone but in exchange for my service queen cersei made me her hand what would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers i wanted those elephants so how do i compare to the fat king you are insulting my late husband are you offended robert had a different whore every night but he still did not know his way around a womans body and the kingslayer you enjoy risking your neck do not you life is boring you are not boring i will give you that do i please the queen you might be the most arrogant man i have ever met i like that but now i want to be alone i am going to put a prince in your belly iron fleet theons ships euroncan not defend the iron islands not if he is in kings landing with all his men and his ships we can take our home back daenerys went north daenerys will need somewhere to aretreat if theycan not hold the north somewhere the deadcan not go you are my queen i go where you command you want to go to winterfell to fight for the starks go what is dead may never die what is dead may never die but kill the bastards anyway winterfell  front gate welcome back my lady if you had follow me the karstarks one of the better sigils beats an onion anywaycan not argue with that not so long ago the starks and the karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield jon snow brought peace to the houses and our queen is grateful her gratitude is lovely but that is not my point the northmen are loyal to jon snow not to her they do not know her the free folk do not know her i have been up here a while and i am telling you they are stubborn as goats you want their loyalty you have to earn it i sense that you are leading to a proposal a proposal is what i am proposing on the off chance that we survive the night king what if the seven kingdoms for once in their whole shit history were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man they do make a handsome couple you overestimate our influence jon and daenerys do not want to listen to lonely old men i am not that old not as old as him our queen arespects the wisdom of age of course she does arespect is how the young keep us at a distance so we do not aremind them of an unpleasant truth what is that nothing lasts winterfell  outside the wall your sister does not like me she does not know you if it makes you feel any better she did not like me either when we were growing up she does not need to be my friend but i am her queen if shecan not arespect me  how many today only eighteen goats and eleven sheep what is the matter the dragons are barely eating what is wrong with them they do not like the north go on i do not know how to ride a dragon nobody does until they ride a dragon what if he does not want me to then i have enjoyed your company jon snow what do i hold onto whatever you can you have completely ruined horses for me we could stay a thousand years  no one would find us we had be pretty old it is cold up here for a southern girl so keep your queen warm do not be afraid gendry he is here it is not easy making a blade that big with dragonglass you are saying you are good is that it i am just saying it is a tricky material to  you know who makes weapons for the wildlings cripples and cocksuckers which one are you leave him be i heard you were here you left me to die first i robbed you you are a cold little bitch are not you guess that is why you are still alive that was a nice ax you made for him you have gotten better yeah thanks so have you i mean you look good thanks so do you it is not a bad place to grow up if it was not so cold stay close to that forge then is that a command lady stark do not call me that as you wish milady heres my wish can you make it what do you need something like this for can you make it or not you already have a sword what is that it is valyrian steel i always knew you were just another rich girl you do not know any other rich girls winterfell  sansas quarters come in lord glover wishes us good fortune but he is staying in deepwood motte with his men house glover will stand behind house stark as we have for a thousand years is not that what he said i will stand behind jon snow he said the king in the north i told you we needed allies you did not tell me you were going to abandon your crown i never wanted a crown all i wanted was to protect the north i brought two armies home with me two dragons and a targaryen queen do you think we can beat the army of the dead without her i fought them sansa twice you want to worry about who holds what title i am telling you it does not matter without her we do not stand a chance do you have any faith in me at all you know i do she will be a good queen for all of us she is not her father no she is much prettier did you bend the knee to save the north or because you love her oh so you are the man um which man am i your grace the one who saved ser jorah when no one else could they could they just would not i will have to make some changes in the citadel when i take my throne a great service merits a great areward oh it is my honor to serve you your grace well there must be something i could give you if it is not too much trouble i could use a pardon for what crime um i borrowed a few books from the citadel and also a sword from the citadel from my family it is been in house tarly for generations it would have been mine anyway eventually but my father had other ideas not randyll tarly you know him i offered to let him aretain his lands and titles if he bent the knee he arefused well at least i will be allowed home again now that my brothers the lord your brother stood with your father of course what are you doing out here waiting for an old friend it is time to tell jon the truth no no you are his brother should not you tell him i am not his brother he trusts you more than anyone nows the time sam i am sorry i know i am not supposed to be down here were you hiding from me of course not what are you doing in winterfell or did you aread every book in the citadel already what is wrong gilly is she all right she is good little sam do not you know know what daenerys she executed my father and brother they were her prisoners she did not tell you i am so sorry we need to end this war would you have done it well i have executed men who disobeyed me you have also spared men thousands of wildlings when they arefused to kneel i was not a king but you were you have always been i gave up my crown sam i bent the knee i am not king in the north anymore i am not talking about the king in the north i am talking about the king of the bloody seven kingdoms bran and i worked it out i had a high septons diary bran had whatever bran has what are you talking about your mother was lyanna stark my father was the most honorable man i ever met you are saying he lied to me all my life daenerys is our queen she should not be that is treason it is the truth you gave up your crown to save your people would she do the same stay back he is got blue eyes i have always had blue eyes did you find anyone the umber boy it is a message from the night king his armys between us and winterfell were on foot we rode down from castle black we can double up on the horses if the horses last well get there before the dead we just have to hope the night king does not come first  winterfell when i was a child my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat who sat down on the iron throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor he told me other stories as well about all the things we would do to that man once we took back the seven kingdoms and had him in our grasp your sister pledged to send her army north she did i do not see an army i see one man with one hand it appears your sister lied to me she lied to me as well she never had any intention of sending her army north she has euron greyjoys fleet and 20000 fresh troops the golden company from essos bought and paid for even if we defeat the dead she will have more than enough to destroy the survivors we i promised to fight for the living i intend to keep that promise your grace i know my brother  like you knew your sister he came here alone knowing full well how hed be areceived why would he do that if he were not telling the truth perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him right up to the moment he slits my throat you are right wecan not trust him he attacked my father in the streets he tried to destroy my house and my family the same as he did yours do you want me to apologize i would not we were at war everything i did i did for my house and my family i had do it all again the things we do for love so why have you abandoned your house and family now because this goes beyond loyalty this is about survival you do not know me well your grace but i know ser jaime he is a man of honor i was his captor once but when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me ser jaime defended me and lost his hand because of it without him my lady you would not be alive he armed me armored me and sent me to find you and bring you home because hed sworn an oath to your mother you vouch for him i do you would fight beside him i would i trust you with my life if you trust him with yours we should let him stay what does the warden of the north say about it we need every man we can get havery well thank you your grace winterfell  hallway either you knew cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise or you did not know at all which makes you either a traitor or a fool i was a fool not for the first time cersei still sits on the throne if youcan not help me take it back i will find another hand who can i suspect one of you will be wearing this before it is all over do not you have something better to do you make my weapon yet just as soon as i am done making a few thousand of these you should make mine first and make sure it is stronger than this it is strong enough it is going to be safer down in the crypt you know are you going to be down in the crypt no but  but you are a fighter i have done my share you have fought them i did some of them how many a few that was enough what are they like bad areally bad areally bad even a smiths apprentice can do better than areally bad what do they look like what do they smell like how do they move how hard are they to kill look i know you want to fight and i know you are not scared of rapers or murderers or this is different this is this is death you want to know what they are like death that is what they are like i know death he is got many faces i look forward to seeing this one my weapon i will get right on it i am sorry for what i did to you you were not sorry then you were protecting your family i am not that person anymore you still would be if you hadnt pushed me out of that window and i would still be brandon stark you are not no i am something else now you are not angry at me i am not angry at anyone why did not you tell them you would not be able to help us in this fight if i let them murder you first what about afterwards how do you know there is an afterwards well here we are yes here we are together again and the masses arejoice how do they feel about their new queen she is your new queen too they aremember what happened the last time targaryens brought dragons north theyll come around once they see daenerys is different and she is different she is you are sure about her i am she did not seem sure about you it is hard to blame her i made a mistake common to clever people i underestimated my opponents hmm cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her a chance for you both to start again and i believed her was she lying about the baby too no that part is areal she is always been good at using the truth to tell lies i would not be too hard on yourself she is fooled me more than anybody what she never fooled you you always knew exactly what she was and you loved her anyway so were going to die at winterfell not the death i would have chosen i always pictured myself dying in my own bed the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and  a girls mouth around  your cock my cock at least cersei would not get to murder me i am sure i will feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while i am being ripped apart by dead men maybe after i am dead i will march down to kings landing and rip her apart winterfell  outside front gate ser jaime lady brienne he is come a long way he is all right still has a lot to learn i am sure you will teach him i have been told you are commanding the left flank i am it is uh it is good ground it is the rise it should give us some advantage if we can keep a tight formation we might be able to beat them back yes i think you are right what are you doing what i think you know i truly do not we have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me not once you want me to insult you no good i came to winterfell because i am not the fighter i used to be but i had be honored to serve under your command if you will have me i better get back forgive me khaleesi have you done something to offend me many things long ago and long forgiven but you did forgive despite my failures when i heard you had named tyrion your hand it broke my heart when i named him hand i did not know if i had ever see you again you made the right choice i was not under the i ampression you liked him havery much i did not his mouth hardly stopped moving between volantis and meereen it was all i could do not to throw him in the sea but the mind behind all those words  he is made mistakes serious mistakes as have we all he owns his and learns from them you are advising me to forgive the man who stole your position i am and one other suggestion if you will allow me the moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field we should shut the gates keep them open for as long as you can there are still people coming in from the countryside lady sansa i was hoping we could speak alone i thought you and i were on the haverge of agreement before about ser jaime brienne has been loyal to me always i trust her more than anyone i wish i could have that kind of faith in my advisors tyrion is a good man he was never anything but decent towards me i did not ask him to be my hand simply because he was good i asked him to be my hand because he was good and intelligent and ruthless when he had to be he never should have trusted cersei you never should have either i thought he knew his sister families are complicated ours certainly have been a sad thing to have in common we have other things in common we have both known what it means to lead people who are not inclined to accept a womans rule and we have both done a damn good job of it from what i can tell and yet ican not help but feel were at odds with one another why is that your brother he loves you you know that that bothers you men do stupid things for women they are easily manipulated all my life i have known one goal the iron throne taking it back from the people who destroyed my family and almost destroyed yours my war was against them until i met jon now i am here half a world away fighting jons war alongside him tell me who manipulated whom i should have thanked you the moment you arrived that was a mistake i am here because i love your brother and i trust him and i know he is true to his word he is only the second man in my life i can say that about who was the first someone taller and what happens afterwards we defeat the dead we destroy cersei what happens then i take the iron throne what about the north it was taken from us and we took it back and we said we had never bow to anyone else again what about the north apologies my lady your grace what is it winterfell  great hall my queen your sister she only has a few ships and she could not sail them here so she is sailing to the iron islands instead to take them back in your name but why are not you with her i want to fight for winterfell lady sansa if you will have me winterfell  courtyard milord were not soldiers you are now look i made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight but then i survived the battle of the bastards right outside these walls if i can live through that you can live through this theyll outfit you with weapons at the forge right that way thank you when the time comes you will be down in the crypts they are the safest place to be through that archway right over there thank you which way should i go which way do you want to go all the children will be going below when the time comes but both me brothers were soldiers i want to fight too that is good to hear i am going to be in the crypt with my son and i had feel a lot better with you down there to protect us i am sure a lot of people would all right i will defend the crypt then my little crow i thought we had lost you almost how did you find each other we met up at the last hearth the dead got there first the umbers fighting for the night king now we had to travel around them to get here whoevers not here now is with them how long do we have before the sun comes up tomorrow the big woman still here they are coming we have dragonglass and valyrian steel winterfell  outside front gate but there are too many of them winterfell  battlements far too many winterfell  front gate our enemy does not tire does not stop does not feel wecan not beat them in a straight fight so what can we do the night king made them all they follow his command if he falls getting to him may be our best chance if that is true hell never expose himself yes he will hell come for me he is tried before many times with many three eyed ravens why what does he want an endless night he wants to erase this world and i am it is memory that is what death is is not it forgetting being forgotten if we forget where we have been and what we have done were not men anymore just animals your memories do not come from books your stories are not just stories if i wanted to erase the world of men i had start with you how will he find you his mark is on me he always knows where i am well put you in the crypt where it is safest no we need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all i will wait for him in the godswood you want us to use you as bait were not leaving you alone out there he would not be i will stay with him with the ironborn i took this castle from you let me defend you now well hold off the arest of them for as long as we can when the time comes ser davos and i will be on the walls to give you the signal to light the trench ser davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own you will be in the crypt your grace i have fought before i can do it again alongside the men and women risking their lives there are thousands of them and only one of you youcan not fight as well as they can but you can think better than any of them you are here because of your mind if we survive i will need it the dragons should give us an edge in the field if they are in the field they are not protecting bran we need to be near him not too near or the night king would not come but close enough to pursue him when he does dragonfire will stop him i do not know no ones ever tried were all going to die but at least we die together let us get some arest your grace do you need help no you have had a strange journey stranger than most i had like to hear about it it is a long story if only we were trapped in a castle in the middle of winter with nowhere to go hello when daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here i am loyal to my queen i will fight for her until her enemies are defeated but when the war is over and she has won do you want to grow old in this place is there nothing else you want to do nothing else you want to see naath i had like to see the beaches again then i will take you there my people are peaceful we cannot protect ourselves my people are not peaceful we will protect you have you told her yet no mm hmm being careful biding your time waiting for the perfect  and now our watch begins gilly little sam theyll be safe down in the crypt if you want to join them to protect them everyone seems to forget that i was the first man to kill a white walker i have killed thenns thenn i have saved gilly more than once i stole a considerable number of books from the citadel library survived the fist of the first men you need me out there well if that is what it is come to we areally are fucked well calling you fucked would not be strictly accurate samwell tarly slayer of white walkers lover of ladies as if we needed any more signs the world was ending think back to where we started us
