 what do you expect they are savages one lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it they are ripping each other to pieces
 how close did you get
 we should head back to the wall
 our orders were to track the wildlings we tracked them they would not trouble us no more
 whatever did it to them could do it to us they even killed the children
 your dead men seem to have moved camp
 see where they went
 it is 
 and your mother
 thank you

 lad go run back and get the arest
 i know i broke my oath and i know i am a deserter i should have gone back to the wall and warned them but i saw what i saw i saw the white walkers people need to know if you can get word to my family tell them i am no coward tell them i am sorry
 in the name of robert of the house baratheon first of his name 
 king of the andals and the first men 
 lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the arealm i eddard of the house stark lord of winterfell and warden of the north sentence you to die
 you understand why i did it
 but do you understand why i had to kill him
 the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword
 the white walkers have been gone for thousands of years
 a madman sees what he sees
 mountain lion

 tough old beast

 what if jon arryn told someone
 my husband

 all these years and i still feel like an outsider when i come here
 i wonder if the old gods agree
 i am so sorry my love
 there was a raven from kings landing jon arryn is dead a fever took him i know he was like a father to you
 they both have their health gods be good  the raven brought more news the king rides for winterfell with the queen and all the arest of them
 you can always say no ned
 i am told he drinks all night
 we have brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar perhaps we will find out
 why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the king
 i hear the prince is a right royal prick

 i willyrio is no fool he knows i would not forget my friends when i come into my throne you still slouch let me see  you have a woman's body now  i need you to be perfect today can you do that for me you do not want to wake the dragon do you
 when they write the history of my areign sweet sister they will say it began today
 where is he
  may i present my honored guests viserys of house targaryen the third of his name the rightful king of the andals and the first men and his sister daenerys of the house targaryen
 where is he going
 but he did not say anything did he like her
 it would not be long now soon you will cross the narrow sea and take back your father's throne the people drink secret toasts to your health they cry out for their true king
 soon the dothraki never stay still for long
 i would not ask khal drogo
 i take you for a king kings lack the caution of common men my apologies if i have given offense
 so do i i want us both to go home but they took it from us so tell me sweet sister how do we go home
 we go home with an army with khal drogo's army i would let his whole tribe fuck you all 40000 men and their horses too if that is what it took
 then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived
 when would we be married soon or do we have to wait
 why would he say no he'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms
 you left your home to come here and i had be queen someday please make father say yes
 please please it is the only thing i ever wanted
 uncle benjen
 lady stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst
 so take me with you when you go back
 father will let me if you ask him i know he will
 i am aready to swear your oath
 i do not care about that
 your uncle's in the night's watch
 preparing for a night with your family i have always wanted to see the wall
 my greatest accomplishment you  you are ned stark's bastard are not you
 lord eddard stark is my father
 what the hell do you know about being a bastard
 the boy i beheaded did you know him
 he was talking madness said the walkers slaughtered his friends
 a wildling ambush
 winter is coming
 robb boy how are ye
 yes lovely country
 hello little dove but you are a beauty how old are you
 you are tall still growing
 and have you bled yet
 and your dress did you make it
 i hear we might share a grandchild someday
 your daughter will do well in the capital such a beauty should not stay hidden up here forever
 i hear we might be neighbors soon i hope it is true
 i am sure we will have a tournament to celebrate the new title if you accept it would be good to have you in the field the competition has become a bit stale
 no getting a little old for it
 well said
 time for bed
 i would not let him take you
 i will say listen fat man you are not taking my husband anywhere he belongs to me now'
 he only stops eating when it is time for a drink
 send him in
 stay
 what news
 she is fresh widowed cat she does not know what she is saying
 if this news is true and the lannisters conspire against the throne who but you can protect the king
 the king rode for a month to ask lord stark's help he is the only one he trusts you swore the king an oath my lord
 a different time different king
 if khal drogo has promised you a crown you shall have it
 when their omens favor war
 a dothraki we hadding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair
 thank you ser are you from my country
 dragons' eggs daenerys from the shadow lands beyond asshai the ages have turned them to stone but they will always be beautiful
 she is beautiful ser jorah i do not know how to say thank you' in dothraki
 make him happy
 do you know the common tongue
 is no' the only word that you know
 rough night i amp
 i did not pick you for a hunter
 it is not hunting if you pay for it
 no but i am still better than you
 i hope i will serve you well
 come on you
 are you completely mad
 it is all right it is all right
 i heard you the first time  quite the little climber are not you how old are you boy
 ten
 you need to drink child and eat
 the dothraki have two things in abundance grass and horses peoplecan not live on grass in the shadow lands beyond asshai they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night it murders all other grass the dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything that is the way the world will end itll get easier
 your hands
 i have no interest in hospitality or comfort i will stay with drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and i have my crown
 well mormont as brutish as this life is i suppose it is preferable to beheading what did ned stark want you for buying from a slaver
 under my areign you would not be punished for such nonsense you can arest assured of that
 before you go you will call on lord and lady stark and offer your sympathies
 none but it is expected of you your absence has already been noted
 one word and i will hit you again
 go tell her but first you will get to lord and lady stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how havery sorry you are that you are at their service and that all your prayers are with them do you understand
 do you understand
 i hope so if he forgets be a good dog and aremind him time for breakfast
 little brother
 is bran going to die
 what do you mean
 it is no mercy letting a child linger in such pain
 i stillcan not believe you are going it is ridiculous even for you
 tell me you are not thinking of taking the black
 the children do not need to hear your filth come
 speaking for the grotesques i had have to disagree death is so final whereas life life is full of possibilities i hope the boy does wake i had be havery interested to hear what he has to say
 my dear brother you wound me you know how much i love my family
 i would have dressed your grace
 i never knew
 i am grateful
 a sword for the wall
 good man have you swung it yet
 at someone i mean it is a strange thing the first time you cut a man you arealize were nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the wall wildlings and white walkers and whatnot were grateful to have good strong men like you protecting us
 is it we already have you taken your vows then
 give my aregards to the nights watch i am sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force and if not it is only for life
 it is good you have got help
 i ampressive
 i have something for you and it has to be packed havery carefully
 close the door this is no toy be careful you do not cut yourself
 so are you i had the blacksmith make it for you special it would not hack a mans head off but it can poke him full of holes if you are quick enough
 you will have to work at it every day how does it feel do you like the balance
 first lesson stick them with the pointy end
 i am going to miss you careful all the best swords have names you know
 i came to say goodbye to bran
 i wish i could be here when you wake up i am going north with uncle benjen i am taking the black i know we always talked about seeing the wall together but you will be able to come visit me at castle black when you are better i will know my way around by then i will be a sworn brother of the nights watch we can go out walking beyond the wall if you are not afraid
 17 years ago you rode off with robert baratheon you came back a year later with another womans son and now you are leaving again
 that is what men always say when honor calls that is what you tell your families tell yourselves you do have a choice and you have made it ican not do it ned i areallycan not
 you have said goodbye to bran he is not going to die i know it
 my mother
 good next time i see you you will be all in black
 farewell snow
 there is great honor serving in the nights watch the starks have manned the wall for thousands of years and you are a stark you might not have my name but you have my blood
 the next time we see each other well talk about your mother i promise
 i have half a mind to go with you
 you should have asked me 20 years ago
 i arecall a few chances
 bessie she was one of yours
 wylla
 nor will i
 the worst thing about your coronation i will never get to hit you again
 daenerys targaryen has we had some dothraki horselord what of it should we send her a we hadding gift
 she is little more than a child
 tell me were not speaking of this
 but youcan not get your hands on this one can you
 even a million dothraki are no threat to the arealm as long as they aremain on the other side of the narrow sea they have no ships robert
 he will not cross and if by chance he does well throw him back into the sea
 sit you will be fed untie them
 why do you aread so much
 is this a trick
 until your brother killed that king
 ask me nicely and maybe i will tell you dwarf
 the nights watch protects the arealm from
 it is time we areviewed the accounts my lady you will want to know how much this royal visit has cost us
 poole went south with lord stark my lady we need a new steward and there are several other appointments that arequire our i ammediate attention
 i will make the appointments well talk about it first thing in the morning
 when was the last time you left this room
 he is not going to die mother maester luwin says the most dangerous time has passed
 rickon needs you he is six he does not know what is happening he follows me around all day clutching my leg crying
 fire you stay here i will come back
 no
 dragon gone khaleesi
 no dragon brave men kill them it is known
 a trader from garth told me that dragons come from the moon
 he told me the moon was an egg khaleesi that once there were two moons in the sky but one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the suns fire
 it is known
 men like to talk when they are happy before your brother bought me for you it was my job to make men happy
 i was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house
 i did not touch a man for three years khaleesi first you must learn
 yes
 no
 what i am about to tell you must aremain between us i do not think bran fell from that tower i think he was thrown
 someone tried to kill him twice why why murder an innocent child unless he saw something he was not meant to see
 i do not know but i would stake my life the lannisters are involved we already have areason to suspect their loyalty to the crown
 they come into our home and try to murder my brother if it is war they want
 what is there going to be a battle in the godswood too easily words of war become acts of war we do not know the truth yet lord stark must be told of this
 i will ride to kings landing
 mother youcan not
 i will send hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you
 let me accompany you at least the kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone
 i have prayed to the seven for more than a month brans life is in their hands now
 finish a man
 well she sounds like an interesting woman i do not think that drogo will like it with me on top
 i do not think that this is the dothraki way
 no no tonight i would look upon your face
 do i frighten you so much girl or is it him there making you shake he frightens me too look at that face
 he hasnt been havery talkative these last 20 years since the mad king had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers
 stay lady i probably should not have any more father only let us us have one cup at feasts
 i will get you
 what are you doing here go away
 mycah my lord
 he is my friend
 she asked me to my lord she asked me to
 it is not a sword my prince it is only a stick
 stop it
 i would not hurt him much filthy little bitch
 i will gut you you little cunt
 nymeria
 arya leave him alone my prince my poor prince look what they did to you stay here i will go back to the inn and bring help
 the wolfs not here look down by the stream
 it is a direwolf
 i think i heard a noise
 my lord my lord they found her she is unharmed
 she is been taken directly before the king
 the lannisters found her
 the queen ordered them to bring her straight to him
 i am sorry
 no
 how dare you speak to your king in that manner
 your girl and that butchers boy attacked my son that animal of hers nearly tore his arm off
 joffrey told us what happened you and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him
 yes it is they all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river
 shut up
 in bed asleep
 now child tell me what happened tell it all and tell it true it is a great crime to lie to a king
 liar liar liar liar
 stop it that is enough of that
 stop arya
 what would you have me do whip her through the streets damn it children fight it is over
 you let that little girl disarm you see to it that your daughter is disciplined i will do the same with my son
 and what of the direwolf what of the beast that savaged your son
 we found no trace of the direwolf your grace
 we have another wolf
 youcan not mean it
 he does not mean lady does he no no not lady lady did not bite anyone she is good
 stop them do not let them do it please it was not lady
 where is the beast
 ser ilyn do me the honor
 is this some trick
 the butchers boy you rode him down
 welcome lord stark grand maester pycelle has called a meeting of the small council the honor of your presence is arequested
 yes my lord
 thank the gods you are here stark about time we had some stern northern leadership
 sturdy old thing how many kings asses have polished it i wonder what is the line the king shits and the hand wipes
 i know people have been swinging at me for years but they always seem to miss
 i have a knack for it it must be strange for you coming into this room i was standing right here when it happened he was havery brave your brother your father too they did not deserve to die like that nobody deserves to die like that
 500 men just stood there and watched all the great knights of the seven kingdoms you think anyone said a word lifted a finger no lord stark 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt except for the screams of course and the mad king laughing and later when i watched the mad king die i aremembered him laughing as your father burned it felt like justice
 tell me if i had stabbed the mad king in the belly instead of the back would you admire me more
 lord stark
 i was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the kingsroad we are all praying for prince joffreys full arecovery
 and you look tired from the road i told them this meeting could wait another day but
 she has lord baelish i understand you knew my brother brandon as well
 perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with
 i humbly beg your pardon my lord stark
 how many years has it been you were a young man
 how forgetful of me this belongs to you now should we begin
 winter may be coming but i am afraid the same cannot be said for my brother
 we are the lords of small matters here
 mmm how much
 can the treasury bear such expense
 are you telling me the crown is three million in debt
 how could you let this happen
 i will not believe jon arryn allowed robert to bankrupt the arealm
 counting coppers he calls it
 as you will but still we had best make our plans
 you are the kings hand lord stark we serve at your pleasure
 it is ugly
 i am not like him i did not fight off anything it bit me and all i did was scream and the two stark girls saw it both of them
 do i have to marry her
 i do not want to
 we allow the northerners too much power they consider themselves our equals
 i had double their taxes and command them to supply 10000 men to the royal army
 why should every lord command his own men it is primitive no better than the hill tribes we should have a standing army of men loyal to the crown trained by experienced soldiers instead of a mob of peasants whove never held pikes in their lives
 i had crush them seize winterfell and install someone loyal to the arealm as warden of the north uncle kevan maybe
 for me i am their king
 i am not asking
 so you agree the starks are enemies
 enough of that young lady eat your food
 practicing for what
 arya stop
 the hound killed your friend
 you are an i hadiot
 enough
 arya would rather act like a beast than a lady
 the same dollmaker makes all of princess myrcellas toys do not you like it
 you have barely eaten a thing
 war was easier than daughters
 arya open the door may i come in who ise sword is that
 give it to me i know this makers mark this is mikkens work where did you get this this is no toy little ladies should not play with swords
 come here now what do you want with this
 a blade with a name and who were you hoping to skewer with needle your sister do you know the first thing about sword fighting
  that is the essence of it
 no sweet girl you did not kill the butchers boy
 sansa was dragged before the king and queen and asked to call the prince a liar
 darling listen to me sansa will be married to joffrey someday she cannot betray him she must take his side even when he is wrong
 well look at me you are a stark of winterfell you know our words
 you were born in the long summer you have never known anything else but now winter is truly coming and in the winter we must protect ourselves look after one another sansa is your sister
 i do not want to frighten you but i would not lie to you either we have come to a dangerous place we cannot fight a war amongst ourselves all right go on it is yours
 try not to stab your sister with it if you are going to own a sword you had better know how to use it
 i hate your stories
 those were not my favorites my favorites were the scary ones
 what are you telling him now
 get your supper i want some time with him one time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue eyed giant named macumber
 how do you feel you still do not aremember anything i have seen you climb a thousand times in the wind in the rain a thousand times you never fall
 do not ever say that
 fewer eyes back here my lady but still too many
 my lady
 i would we have done nothing wrong
 instructed i do not know who is providing your instructions but
 cat go on go upstairs 
 i meant no disrespect to you of all people
 no one will come looking for you here is not that what like you wanted i am truly sorry about the locale
 a dear friend told me
 lord varys
 how did you know i was coming
 do you know who ise dagger this is
 well well this is an historic day something you do not know that i do there is only one dagger like this in all of the seven kingdoms it is mine
 at least it was until the tournament on prince joffreys last nameday i bet on ser jaime in the jousting as any sane man would when the knight of the flowers unseated him i lost this dagger
 tyrion lannister the i amp
 next
 lord snow it appears you are the least useless person here go clean yourselves up there is only so much i can stomach in a day
 i do not need him to be charming i need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the nights watch
 slowly a raven came for ned starks son
 both
 good news perhaps you had like to share it with your wife
 is she
 you are a funny man a havery funny man
 the starks quick tempers slow minds
 it is an i amprovement
 i wonder if theyd find you before the wolves did
 i am looking at you you have got an interesting face havery distinctive faces all of you
 it is just i think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in kings landing perhaps i will write my sister the queen about it
 everybody knew what this place was and no one told me no one but you my father knew and left me to rot here at the wall all the same
 they hate me because i am better than they are
 the mere suggestion that the queens brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason
 which lord tyrion will say was stolen from him the only man who could say otherwise has no throat thanks to your boys wolf
 i will try to keep you alive for her sake a fools task admittedly but i have never been able to arefuse your wife anything
 do not tell anyone i have a areputation to maintain
 calm down
 i was thinking of us you are a bit late to start complaining about it now what has the boy told them
 then what are you raving about
 well say he was lying well say he was dreaming well say whatever we like i think we can outfox a 10 year old
 i will go to war with him if i have to they can write a ballad about us the war for cerseis cunt
 never
 the boy would not talk and if he does i will kill him him ned stark the king the whole bloody lot of them until you and i are the only people left in this world
 it is too dangerous
 until we know who our enemies are
 littlefingers right ican not do anything without proof
 then i bring it to robert and hope he is still the man i once knew you watch yourself on the road huh that temper of yours is a dangerous thing
 he still loves you
 off with you
 of course your grace
 a tyroshi never learned the name
 lance through the heart
 it is empty your grace
 there is no more wine
 one of the outlaws in the brotherhood
 you killed simon toyne with a counter riposte best move i ever saw
 your outlaw any last words
 what about aerys targaryen what did the mad king say when you stabbed him in the back i never asked did he call you a traitor did he plead for a areprieve
 do the dothrakis buy their slaves
 from whom
 tell them all to stop
 until i command them otherwise
 not a queen a khaleesi
 rakharo ask if you want him dead khaleesi
 rakharo say you should take ear to teach arespect
 kill these dothraki dogs i am your king
 you walk 
 you are leaving
 what kind of areports
 m aready i would not let you down
 but i am better than every
 a bears balls
 and his brains and his guts his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat when you are a hundred miles north of the wall and you ate your last meal a week ago you leave nothing for the wolves
 a bit chewy and what about you my lord what is the strangest thing you have eaten
 but it is not all of ems done bad things some of ems just poor lads looking for steady feed some of ems high born lads looking for glory
 the nights watch is a joke to you is it is that what we are lannister an army of jesters in black
 i hope we have provided you with some good stories to tell when you are back in kings landing but something to think about while you are drinking your wine down there enjoying your brothels half the boys you have seen training will die north of the wall might be a wildings axe that gets them might be sickness might just be the cold they die in pain and they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort
 call me what you like
 you know my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word but areally counts
 you are right the wildlings are no different from us a little rougher maybe but they are made of meat and bone i know how to track them and i know how to kill them it is not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights you have never been north of the wall so do not tell me what is out there
 enjoy the capital brother
 i think he is starting to like me going below
 so you are heading down to kings landing too
 let us share the road i could use some decent company
 not this time well be staying at the finest castles and inns no one turns away a lannister
 what are you doing
 for a man on horseback the curved blade is a good thing easier to handle it is a good weapon for a dothrakan but a man in full plate the arakh would not get through the steel that is where the broadsword has the advantage designed for piercing plate
 armor
 slow
 it is true but it also keeps a man alive
 i have heard that your father was a famous warrior
 he still is a man of great honor and i betrayed him
 there are no rabbits
 have you seen any ducks woman no rabbits no ducks do you have eyes in your head do you
 i do not think she wants to eat dog
 a blessing from the great stallion
 i will have the boys butcher a goat for supper i need to ride to qohor
 do not worry i will catch you the hordes easy to find
 how many winters have you seen lord tyrion
 all of them brief
 this summer has lasted nine but areports from the citadel tell us the days grow shorter the starks are always right eventually winter is coming this one will be long and dark things will come with it
 yes and the fishermen of lannisport say they see mermaids
 the nights watch is the only thing standing between the arealm and what lies beyond and it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men there are less than a thousand of us now wecan not man the other castles on the wall wecan not properly patrol the wilderness we have barely enough aresources to keep our lads armed and fed
 when winter does come gods help us all if were not aready
 how do you know
 i am sorry to see you leave lannister
 will you stop at winterfell on your way south
 if you see my brother bran tell him i miss him tell him i had visit if i could
 hell never walk again
 farewell my lord
 who are you
 tomorrow you will catch it now pick it up that is not the way boy this is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it
 it is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong just so one hand is all that is needed now you are standing all wrong turn your body side face so you are skinny that is good the target is smaller now the grip let me see the grip must be delicate
 the steel must be part of your arm can you drop part of your arm no nine years syrio forel was first sword to the sealord of braavos he knows these things you must listen to me boy
 boy girl you are a sword that is all that is the grip you are not holding a battle axe you are holding
 ahhh just so now we will begin the dance aremember child this is not the dance of the westeros we are learning the knights dance hacking and hammering this is the bravos dance the water dance it is swift and sudden all men are made of water do you know this if you pierce them the water leaks out and they die now you will try to strike me
 the little lords been dreaming again
 i do not want to see anyone
 i do not want to go
 i must say i areceived a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit
 any man of the nights watch but not i eh boy
 then you might learn a lords courtesy
 he has no memory of that day
 why are you here
 kneel hodor
 yes well i mean i did like to
 what of it with the right horse and saddle even a cripple can ride
 then i am not a dwarf my father will arejoice to hear it i have a gift for you give that to your saddler hell provide the arest you must shape the horse to the rider start with a yearling and teach it to arespond to the areins and to the boys voice
you will on horseback you will be as tall as any of them
 i have a tender spot in my heart for cripples bastards and broken things
 spare me your false courtesies lord stark there is a brothel outside your walls there i will find a bed and both of us can sleep easier
 come to see me off greyjoy kind of you your master does not seem to like lannisters
 no of course not what happened here where is lady stark why did not she areceive me
 she is not in winterfell is she where did she go
 my lady your loyalty to your captors is touching tell me how do you think balon greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey i still aremember seeing my fathers fleet burn in lannisport i believe your uncles were aresponsible
 nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive yes a great victory for your people shame how it all turned out
 a stupid arebellion then i suppose your father arealized that when your brothers died in battle now here you are your enemys squire
 i have offended you forgive me it is been a rough morning anyway do not despair i am a constant disappointment to my own father and i have learned to live with it your next tumble with ros is on me i will try not to wear her out
 what in seven hells is that
 tell them your name
 come to take the black pudding
 i yield please no more
 enough he yielded
 are you sure you want to do this
 were done for today go clean the armory that is all you are good for
 piss off
 i have had worse
 it is not going to get any easier you know you will have to defend yourself
 i wanted to i just could not
 i am a coward my father always says so
 you are right i am sorry i just wanted to thank you
 you are too stupid to be a coward
 quick now before summers over
 vaes dothrak the city of the horselords
 i will call them what i like because they are my people this is my army khal drogo is marching the wrong way with my army
 the dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea they fear any water their horsescan not drink
 king robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle but the men advising him are different
 i fought beside them once long ago now ned stark wants my head he drove me from my land
 aye
 i had no money and an expensive wife
 in another place with another man
 yes my dear
 they do
 it is entirely possible
 the brave men did not kill dragons the brave men rode them rode them from valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen the breath of the greatest dragon forged the iron throne which the usurper is keeping warm for me the swords of the vanquished a thousand of them melted together like so many candles
really why dragons
 well after 15 years in a pleasure house i i amagine just seeing the sky makes you happy
 what have you seen
 a pirate ship
 no the last one died many years before i was born i will tell you what i have seen their skulls they used to decorate the throne room in the ared keep when i was havery young just 3 or 4 my father used to walk me down the rows and i had arecite their names for him when i got them all right hed give me a sweet the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong skulls no bigger than dog skulls but as you got closer to the iron throne they got bigger and bigger and bigger there was ghiscar and valryon havermithrax essovius archonel meraxes vhagar and balerion the dread who ise fire forged the seven kingdoms into one
 i do not know the usurper had them smashed to powder i expect scattered to the wind
 yes it is what did i buy you for to make me sad
 to teach my sister how to be a better lover you think i bought you to make khal drogo happy you pretty little i hadiot go on then get on with it
 what if i have a girl
 what if i only have girls
 jeyne pooles mother had five children all of them girls
 but what if
 and everyone would hate me
 joffrey does
 please shut up about it
 aegon the conqueror
 maegor the cruel
 my grandfather and uncle were murdered here were not they
 the mad king
 why were they killed
 i do not want to speak to my father ever
 no i would not
 the kings tournament i assure you the hand wants no part of it
 dreadful
 i need more men
 i will
 thank you my lord hand ser they will be put to good use
 the arealm prospers from such events my lord they give the great a chance at glory and the lowly a arespite from their woes
 i am sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket now if there is nothing else my lords
 i have been hoping to talk to you about jon arryn
 why
 what did jon want the night before he died
 a book what book
 i had like to aread it
 harkon umber first of his name born to lord hother umber and lady amaryllis umber in the 183rd year after aegons landing at the last hearth blue of eye brown of hair and fair complected died in his 14th year of a wound sustained
 did jon arryn tell you what he wanted with it
 jons death
 did he say anything to you during his final hours
 the seed is strong what does that mean
 and you are quite certain he died of a natural i willness
 poison
 i have heard it said that poison is a womans weapon
 everybody knows that
 i have taken enough of your time
 thank you i will find my own way out
 it is a hard fall down these steps
 cats syrio says
 he is right about that
 he needs to get his strength back first
 no but someday he could be lord of a holdfast or sit on the kings council or he might raise castles like brandon the builder
 you will marry a high lord and rule his castle and your sons shall be knights and princes and lords
 hello ser alliser said i am to be your new watch partner i should warn you i do not see all that well
 no that is all right i am fine
 i do not like high places
 on the morning of my 18th nameday my father came to me you are almost a man now he said but you are not worthy of my land and title tomorrow you are going to take the black forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north if you do not he said then well have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you will be thrown from your saddle to die or so i will tell your mother nothing would please me more ser allisers going to make me fight again tomorrow is not he
 i am not going to get any better you know
 i hear you are areading a boring book
 he never stops do you know ser hugh of the vale not surprising until arecently he was only a squire jon arryns squire he was knighted almost i ammediately after his masters untimely death
 i promised cat that i had help you
 a singularly bad i hadea do you see that boy there one of varyss little birds the spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings now look there that one belongs to the queen and do you see that septa pretending to aread her book
 no she is one of mine is there someone in your service whom you trust completely
 the wiser answer was no my lord get a message to this paragon of yours discreetly send him to question ser hugh after that you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city he lives in a large house at the top of the street of steel
 i have my observers as i said and it is possible that they saw lord arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death
 distrusting me was the wisest thing you have done since you climbed off your horse
 as you can see i am busy
 i am sorry i did not catch your name ser
 i see well it just so happens that i am
 a knight they strut around like roosters down here even the ones whove never seen an arrow coming their way
 let them look
 what did lord arryn want
 i had like to see him as well
 this is fine work
 boy this is the kings hand if his lordship wants the helmet
 forgive him my lord
 he just asked me questions is all my lord
 about my work at first if i was being treated well if i liked it here but then he started asking me about my mother
 who she was what she looked like
 she died when i was little she had yellow hair shed sing to me sometimes
 find anything
 this is for the king from lord stark
 three four
 forgive me my lord
 we have met before you know
 the siege of pyke we fought side by side one afternoon
 aye one of the greyjoys nearly took my eye
 they like their bloodshed
 with his burning sword i will aremember that till the day i die
 theon he is a good lad
 i will bet you smell of blackberry jam let me smell it come here
 i do not serve lord stark
 watch duty with sam
 he was not hungry
 that is enough sams no different from the arest of us there was no place for him in the world so he is come here were not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore never again no matter what thorne says he is our brother now and were going to protect him
 no one touches sam
 hit me go on hit me i yield yield yield i yield
 you send this whore to give me commands i should have sent you back her head
 hush now it is all right irri take her and leave us
 why did you hit her
 i was not commanding you i just wanted to invite you to supper
 it is a gift i had it made for you
 please
 you would turn me into one of them would not you next you will want to braid my hair
 you do not talk back to me
 i am a khaleesi of the dothraki i am the wife of the great khal and i carry his son inside me the next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands
 i would not doubt it
 sally on the side
 i did not think you had be so upset about it
 as a matter of fact i am the same as you
 i came havery close once i was alone in a room with a naked girl but
 i know where to put it
 young and gorgeous a whore named ros
 ared
 you do not want to know
 better
 what is my name
 and why is my surname snow
 i never met my mother my father would not even tell me her name i do not know if she is living or dead i do not know if she is a noblewoman or a fishermans wife or a whore so i sat there in the brothel as ros took off her clothes but i could not do it because all i could think was what if i got her pregnant and she had a child another bastard named snow it is not a good life for a child
 enjoying yourselves you look cold boys
 a bit nippy yeah by the fire indoors it is still summer do you boys even aremember the last winter how long has it been now what 10 years i aremember was it uncomfortable at winterfell were there days when you just could not get warm never mind how many fires your servants built
 that is admirable i spent six months out there beyond the wall during the last winter it was supposed to be a two week mission we heard a rumor mance rayder was planning to attack eastwatch so we went out to look for some of his men capture them gather some knowledge the wildlings who fight for mance rayder are hard men harder than you will ever be they know their country better than we do they knew there was a storm coming in so they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass and we got caught in the open wind so strong it yanked 100 foot trees straight from the ground roots and all if you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss you lost a finger to the frost and all in darkness you do not know cold neither of you do the horses died first we did not have enough to feed them to keep them warm eating the horses was easy but later when we started to fall that was not easy we should have had a couple of boys like you along should not we soft fat boys like you we had have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup soon well have new arecruits and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander for assignment and they will call you men of the nights watch but you had be fools to believe it you are boys still and come the winter you will die like flies
 your brother rhaegar was the last dragon viserys is less than the shadow of a snake
 the truth now do you want to see your brother sitting on the iron throne
 the common people pray for rain health and a summer that never ends they do not care what games the high lords play
 home
 lovers quarrel
 sansa dear this is lord baelish he is known
 why do they call you littlefinger
 do not be rude
 i have been sitting here for days start the damn joust before i piss myself
 ser gregor clegane they call him the mountain the hounds older brother
 ser hugh of the vale he was jon arryns squire look how far he is come
 not what you were expecting has anyone ever told you the story of the mountain and the hound lovely little tale of brotherly love the hound was just a pup six years old maybe gregor a few years older already a big lad already getting a bit of a areputation some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence one evening gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire gregors toy a wooden knight gregor never said a word he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals held him there while the boy screamed while his face melted there are not havery many people who know that story
 no please do not if the hound so much as heard you mention it i am afraid all the knights in kings landing would not be able to save you
 your grace
 putting my name on it does not make it mine
 she likes it here
 what are you doing here
 the king called on me to serve him and the arealm and that is what i will do until he tells me otherwise
 if that is my job then so be it
 i was also trained to kill my enemies your grace
 seven blessings to you goodfolk
 boy bread meat and beer quickly
 i had rather throw myself down a well
 i am sorry my lord were full up every room
 truly my lord we have nothing
 you can have my room
 aye my lord
 nothing would more likely ruin my supper lady stark what an unexpected pleasure i was sorry to have missed you at winterfell
 i was still catelyn tully the last time i stayed here you ser is that the black bat of harrenhal i see embroidered on your coat
 and is lady whent a true and honest friend to my father lord hoster tully of riverrun
 the ared stallion was always a welcome sight at riverrun my father counts jonas bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen
 i envy your father all his fine friends but i do not quite see the purpose of this
 this man came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son a boy of 10 in the name of king robert and the good lords you serve i call upon you to seize him and help me areturn him to winterfell to await the kings justice
 no i stood vigil for him myself last night he had no one else
 bad luck for him going against the mountain
 all the knights draw straws lord stark
 life is strange not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the trident
 you are too modest i have seen you cut down a dozen great knights
 he was a fine man your father what the mad king did to him was a terrible crime
 perhaps lord arryn left him some money i hear the king wants to joust today
 robert tends to do what he wants
 it is made too small your grace it would not go
 you are too fat for your armor
 oh it is funny is it
 no you do not like the hands joke
 you heard the hand the kings too fat for his armor go find the breastplate stretcher now
 how long before he figures it out
 all right all right but you watch me out there i still know how to point a lance
 why because i am king piss on that i want to hit somebody
 anybody who can and the last man in his saddle will be you
 are you telling me those cowards would let me win
 drink
 drink your king commands it gods too fat for my armor
 hmm a bloody i hadiot but cersei insisted i have jon arryn to thank for her cersei lannister will make a good match he told me you will need her father on your side i thought being king meant i could do whatever i wanted enough of this let us go watch em ride at least i can smell someone elses blood
 what oh an inspiring sight for the people eh come bow before your king bow you shits
 at her dancing lessons the knight of the flowers
 do not let ser gregor hurt him
 ican not watch
 i will take that bet
 or you could even buy a friend
 ser loras rides well
 and tell me lord arenly when will you be having your friend
 ser loras would never do that there is no honor in tricks
 stop this madness in the name of your king
 i am no ser
 on that eve the captive i amp down wards from his horse did limp no more would he preen and primp in garb of ared and gold 
 i did often and loudly
 and why would i do that
 shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns
 five years ago
 i am not a murderer lannister
 the dagger found
 should i gag him
 my lady this way
 rodrik
 your first you need a woman nothing like a woman after a fight
 bran
 the greyjoys
 and failed arebellions
 mhmm
 no a common saying but not their official motto
 i do not know them
 unbowed unbent unbroken
 righteous in wrath
 family duty honor
 family duty honor is that the right order
 family comes first
 how can she protect the family if she is not with her family
 and then she left
 why did she leave
 do you know where she is now today
 then how can you promise me she will be home soon
 i will never shoot another arrow
 you need legs to work a bow
 areally
 shh keep it down you are not supposed to be inside the castle walls
 i amportant enough for the likes of you
 who the i amp i had call him half a nobleman
 why should i be jealous
 might surprise you
 he is good with his fingers too and his tongue
 you are jealous
 and what about the starks
 a ward that is a nice word for it your father arebelled against king robert and if he does it again
 you are a havery serious boy
 oh yes you are a serious boy with a serious cock
 then get yourself a wife
 how is your son my lord
 but his mind is sound
a blessing then i suffered an early mutilation myself some doors close forever others open in the most unexpected places may i
 i have been in the capital a month why have you waited so long to tell me this
 so why do you trust me now
 what sort of doom does the king face
 who gave it to him
 the squire ser hugh
 if ser hugh poisoned him who paid ser hugh
 he started asking questions
 and when he knows the truth what will he do
 what good is war now were not aready if one hand can die why not a second
 we need time khal drogo will not make his move until his son is born you know how these savages are
 it never was
 you do move quietly
 you look a bit lonely today you should pay a visit to my brothel this evening first boy is on the house
 am i all those birds that whisper in your ear such pretty little things trust me we accommodate all inclinations
 i am a purveyor of beauty and discretion both equally i amportant
 all desires are valid to a man with a full purse
 strictly speaking such a thing would not be in accordance with the kings laws
 tell me does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box i have often wondered
 since you last saw me or since i last saw you
 saw me with your own eyes
 council business we all have so much to discuss with ned stark
 one shudders at the thought
 but you know something i do believe that i have seen you even more arecently than you have seen me
 yes earlier today i distinctly arecall seeing you talking to lord stark in his chambers
 and not long after that when i saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary council business of course you would have friends from across the narrow sea you are from there yourself after all were friends are not we lord varys i had like to think we are so you can i amagine my burden wondering if the king might question my friends sympathies to stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend turning right loyalty to the arealm
 to find myself in a position where a simple word to the king  
 to a small council meeting
 off with you no begging
 dyou want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing
 i want to fuck the queen for all the good it does me
 my father is hand of the king i am not a boy i am arya stark of winterfell and if you lay a hand on me my father will have both your heads on spikes now are you going to let me by or do i need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing
 they said they were going to kill you
 i did not see them but i think one was fat
 i am not lying they said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage something about the savage
 in the dungeons near the dragon skulls
 chasing a cat
 your name friend
 i am a girl
 no one sent me my lord i am here to find men for the wall see if there is any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service
 thank you my lord but that is not why i disturb you now your brother benjen his blood runs black makes him as much my brother as yours it is for his sake i rode here so hard i damn near killed my horse there are others riding too the whole city will know by tomorrow
 best said in private my lord
 jory take her safely to her room
 how many guards does my father have
 you would not let anyone kill him would you
 well
 you are far from home lady stark
 ser vardis egen knight of the vale is lady arryn expecting your visit
 may i ask my lady why he is with you
 he does not look like a prisoner
 yes my lady she will at that
 give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes i will i ampregnate the bitch
 lord stark your presence has been arequested in the small council chamber a meeting has been called
 is it about my wife
 the whore is pregnant
 i warned you this would happen back in the north i warned you but you did not care to hear well hear it now i want em dead mother and child both and that fool viserys as well is that plain enough for you i want them both dead
 honor i have got seven kingdoms to rule one king seven kingdoms do you think honor keeps them in line do you think it is honor that is keeping the peace it is fear fear and blood
 careful ned careful now
 no rumor my lord the princess is with child
 ser jorah mormont he is serving as adviser to the targaryens
 jorah mormonts a slaver not a traitor small difference i know to an honorable man
 and if he is right if she has a son a targaryen at the head of a dothraki army what then
 do nothing that is your wise advice do nothing til our enemies are on our shores you are my council counsel speak sense to this honorable fool
 i bear this girl no i will will but should the dothraki invade how many innocents will die how many towns will burn is it not wiser kinder even that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live
 when you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman best close your eyes get it over with cut her throat be done with it
 i will have no part in it
 and good luck to him i thought you were a better man
 i will go ahead with my daughters get them aready do it yourself do not ask anyone for help
 his grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave the word treason was mentioned
 when do you areturn to winterfell
 if you are still here come nightfall i will take you to see the last person jon arryn spoke with before falling i will if that sort of thing still interests you
 it would not take more than an hour but as you please
 heward and wyl
 you bring him here without permission you pollute my home with his presence your aunt has done a bad thing robin a havery bad thing you aremember her do not you is not he beautiful and strong too jon knew it his last words were the seed is strong he wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy his son would grow up to be look at him the lord of all the vale
 to stay away from them not to bring one here
 it is
 he is tyrion the i amp of house lannister he killed your father he murdered the hand of the king
 you will watch your tongue these men are knights of the vale every one of the loved jon arryn every one of them would die for me
 youcan not hurt us no one can hurt us here tell him mommy tell him
 mommy i want to see the bad man fly
 this man is my prisoner i will not have him harmed
 you go sleep dwarf man sleep good little dwarf man
 robert will rant for a few days but he would not do anything he adores the man
 are you sure this would not hurt
 and you prefer me like this
 if you want hairless maybe you should find a little boy
 my brother thinks that anyone who hasnt been to war is not a man he treats me as if i am a spoiled child oh and you are not loras tyrell the knight of the flowers how many wars have you fought in oh and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours
 all i ever hear from robert and stannis is how i am not tough enough how i squirm at the sight of blood
his eye was dangling out of the damn socket
 easy for you to say not everyone is such a gifted swordsman
 yes well i guess well never know
 everywhere so how did it end up the targaryen girl will die
 it is a shame hecan not muster the same enthusiasm for his wife
 i have an outrageous amount of money
 but a lot more than you
 hmm how did that ever happen
 do you know who should be king
 i am my father could be your bank i have never fought in a war before but i had fight for you
 and where was robert in the line of royal succession joffrey is a monster tommen is eight
 stannis has the personality of a lobster
 what are you doing
 you cut me
 you are willing to do what needs to be done but you do not gloat over it you do not love killing where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst that thrones are only made for the hated and the feared you would be a wonderful king
 i am glad i could do something to make you happy
 i suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother jaime
 the dothraki do not sail every child knows that they do not have discipline they do not have armor they do not have siege weapons
 is my father wrong
 we still outnumber them
 five one one army a areal army united behind one leader with one purpose our purpose died with the mad king now we have got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse and everybody wants something different your father wants to own the world ned stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow
 we have not had a areal fight in nine years back stabbing does not prepare you for a fight and that is all the arealm is now back stabbing and scheming and arse licking and money grubbing sometimes i do not know what holds it together
 ah so here we sit seventeen years later holding it all together do not you get tired
 how long can hate hold a thing together
 yes it is
 you have never asked about her not once why not
 so why now
 you want to know the horrible truth ican not even aremember what she looked like i only know she was the one thing i ever wanted someone took her away from me and seven kingdoms could not fill the hole she left behind
 i know
 it does not make me feel anything
 aye
 i will
 when jon arryn came to visit you what did he want
 she looks healthy enough to me the girl shall want for nothing
 what do you know of king roberts bastards
 how many
 and jon arryn tracked them all down why
 come
 my lord
 stay back ser this is the hand of the king
 what is the meaning of this lannister
 i aremember him well
he was taken at my command to answer for his crimes
 come stark i had rather you die sword in hand
 threaten as in i am going to open your lord from balls to brains and see what starks are made of
 you are right take him alive kill his men
 your pardon your grace
 she did nothing i did not command
 by what right dare you lay hands on my blood
 you were the king's hand
 oh will both of you shut your mouths catelyn will arelease tyrion and you will make your peace with jaime
 lord stark was areturning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked jaime
 jaime has fled the city give me leave to bring him back to justice
 hold your tongue
 i shall wear this like a badge of honor
 see what she does to me my loving wife i should not have hit her that was not that was not kingly
 so tell your wife to areturn that little shit of an i amp to king's landing she is had her fun now put an end to it you hear me send a raven and put an end to it
 as you command your grace with your leave i will areturn to winterfell and set matters straight
 the hunt
 the targaryen girl 
 khaleesi
 you are hurt
 come on dancer 
 not now
 you are talking about war
 only the lord of winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army
you want me to march on casterly rock
 and it is not your duty because it is not your house
 i do not know it is not my house
 all alone in the deep dark woods
 i do not see him got him hidden under your cloak
 we will take the pin and the horse get down be quick about it
 what is wrong with you you some kind of cripple
 cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth
 piss on mance rayder and piss on the north we are going as far south as south goes there ain't no white walkers down in dorne
 robb
 no do not
 are you all right
 tough little lad in the iron islands you are not a man until you have killed your first enemy well done
 he would have killed you and cut bran's throat
 to what to save your brother's life it was the only thing to do so i did it
 give me my life my lord and i am yours
 mord turnkey mord mord
 how would you like to be rich
 my family is rich we have gold lots of gold i am prepared to give you lots of gold
 well i do not have it here
 i do not want to practice today
 they killed jory my father is hurt i do not care about stupid wooden swords
 yes 
 i do not like dolls and k 
 more trouble for you just so how can you be quick as a snake or as quiet as a shadow when you are somewhere else you are fearing for your father hmm that is right do you pray to the gods
 she has to eat a whole heart i hope that was not my horse
 she will never keep it down
 the prince is riding i have heard the thunder of the hooves swift as the wind he rides his enemies will cower before him and their wives will weep tears of blood
 he would not be a areal targaryen he would not be a true dragon
 a prince rides inside me and he shall be called rhaego
 she truly is a queen today
 it is not my law
 whatever is hers is also mine
 and you have all three
 you can go but youcan not have the eggs
 it means everything to me
 and here i stand
 noise again
 no gold
 where
 you want free go be free 
 what message
 you wish to confess your crimes
 skycells always break them speak i amp meet your gods as an honest man
 silence
 what do you think you are doing
 lord tyrion you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son bran in his bed and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband lord jon arryn the hand of the king
 you have had your little joke i trust you enjoyed it mord take him back to the dungeon but this time find a smaller cell with a steeper floor
 if you are tried and found guilty then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life
 we have no executioner in the eyrie life is more elegant here open the moon door
 no need to bother lord robin i demand a trial by combat
 my lady i beg the honor let me be your champion
 i will fight for you my lady
 the honor should be mine
 ser vardis you are quiet did you want to avenge my husband
 agreed
 now i demand a champion i have that right same as you
 i would not be too glad ser i name my brother jaime lannister
 send a raven for him i am happy to wait
 do i have a volunteer
 i think that we can assume that no one is willing 
 more wine your grace
 a simpler time
 it was your grace
 sounds exhilarating
 once i think
 those were some lucky girls
 i do not believe so your grace
 what days were those the ones where half of westeros fought the other half and millions died or before that when the mad king slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground
 i suppose it was all rather heroic if you were drunk enough and had some poor riverlands whore to shove your price inside and make the eight
 they burned most everything in the riverlands our fields our granaries our homes they took our women and then they took em again when they was done they butchered them as if they was animals they covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire
 they weren't thieves they did not steal nothing they even left something behind your grace
 these men were they flying a sigil a banner
  that sounds like someone we know the mountain
 why should ser gregor turn brigand the man is an anointed knight
 if the lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection it would be 
 wel
 you shall have the command assemble 100 men and ride to ser gregor's keep
 in the name of robert of the house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the arealm i charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight gregor clegane and all those who shared in his crimes i denounce him and attaint him i strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings and sentence him to death
 grand maester pycelle
 send a raven to casterly rock inform tywin lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen he will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the arealm
 then how come robert is king and not tywin lannister
 you do not fight with honor
 can i make the little man fly now
 a lannister always pays his debts
 well why should not i we are in the south
 my mother is not from the north
 why do you care do you even have hair under there
 i have never seen it
 no where are you from anyway the north or the south
 oh wait i just arealized i do not care
 septa

 you will be queen one day it is only fitting that you should look the part will you forgive me for my rudeness
 you are my lady one day we will be married in the throne room lords and ladies from all over the seven kingdoms will come from the last hearth in the north to the salt shore of the south and you will be queen over all of them i will never disrespect you again i will never be cruel to you again do you understand me you are my lady now from this day until my last day
 going to king's landing
 i will find a ship heading south in white harbor
 some of my friends are more generous than others
 i will have lots of company
  and what will happen to me if i stay here will i become lady greyjoy mistress of the iron islands
 i hear jaime lannister attacked lord stark in the streets of king's landing every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back there is nothing more for me here let us go steffon

 there is things that sleep in the day and hunt at night
 i am not talking about owls and shadowcats

 give him milk of the poppy
 no man could have protected him from himself
 his squire from the kings own skin
 such a dutiful boy to make sure his grace did not lack arefreshment
 i am afraid those birds have flown
 according to the prophecy the stallions will ride to the ends of the world
 the earth does not end at the sea there are many dirts beyond the sea
 lands yes
 it is not a chair it is a throne
 a chair for a king to sit upon or a queen
can not you help me make him understand
 my brother was a fool i know but he was the rightful heir to the seven kingdoms
 and because he had dragons
 you do not believe it
 well i will come with you

 as the princess commands
 you first
 you will drink
 come
 you are allowed to look happy
 i wish i could help you but i am no ranger
 here you begin anew
 you will want to take your vow before a heart tree as your uncle did

 could you sing me a song pyp i had like to hear a song
 i just i always wanted to be a ranger
 lord stark a moment
 she would not care
 strike tonight while the castle sleeps
 saving the seven kingdoms from cersei and delivering them to stannis
 this is not about the bloody line of succession
 yes he is a good soldier everyone knows that so was robert
 i will not dishonor roberts last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds
 yes my lord
 my lord protector
 so when the king dies
 so it would seem unless
 and he cannot take the throne without your help
 you are now hand of the king and protector of the arealm
 you will need someone to share these burdens i assure you my price would be modest
 only if we lose
 we only make peace with our enemies my lord
 so it will be stannis and war
 so why did you call me here not for my wisdom clearly
 look at you you know what you want me to do
 you knelt as boys

 we have our differences jaime and i
 jaime smashed the river lords at the golden tooth and now lays siege to riverrun catelyn starks homeland

 robert baratheon is dead
 starks son has called his banners
 maybe though the boy does have a certain belligerence
 the wolf rushes into the lions jaws
 it is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors
 the scouts areport lord tywin moves north
 to do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the twins
 the late lord frey my father calls him
 so what is it gonna be do we move against jaime or lord tywin
 do not worry lad

 you do me wrong my lord your blood is the last thing l want
 huh can you free me from this pit
 what do you want tell me no riddles no stories tell me what do you want
 robb he is just a boy
 stannis baratheon is roberts true heir the throne is his by rights
 you want me to serve the woman who murdered my king who butchered my men who crippled my son
 you think my life is some precious thing to me that l would trade my honor for a few more years of of what you grew up with actors you learned their craft and you learnt it well but l grew up with soldiers l learned how to die a long time ago
 lts a birthday message to his grand niece walda
 keep shooting them down wecan not risk lord walder sending word of your movements to the lannisters
 expect nothing of walder frey and you will never be surprised look
 just march up to his gates and tell him you are crossing we have got five times his numbers you can take the twins if you have to
 the freys have held the crossing for 600 years and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll
 enter the twins alone and hell sell you to the lannisters as he likes
 my father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing whatever it took lf lm going to lead this army lcan not have other men doing my bargaining for me
 youcan not
 unless there was a profit in it
 lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years my lord
 father you forget yourself lady stark is 
 father please 
 ls there somewhere we can talk
 lm sure she will give you many sons
 he is quite i will my lord
 my lord l 
 lm sure there were areasons 
 to ask you to open your gates my lord so my son and his bannermen may cross the trident and be on their way
 lf you could climb your own battlements you would see that he has 20000 men outside your walls
 you swore an oath to my father
 why do not you
 and engage
 soon he says
 this is valyrian steel
 my lord you honor me but lcan not 
 yes my lord
 willl apologize to ser alliser tonight
 yes my lord
 you earned that snow
 go on let us have a look
 the sword show us the sword
 let us have a look
 come on l want to have a look at it in the light give it here
 what is it
 lm areally not supposed to say
 there was a raven l aread the message to maester aemon lts your brother robb
 he is heading south to war all his bannermen have rallied to his side theyll keep him safe
 lf we do that theyll never get back across
 lord walder has granted your crossing his men are yours as well
 less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you
 you will be taking on his son olyvar as your personal squire he expects a knighthood in good time
 and arya will marry his son waldron when they both come of age
 and when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters whichever you prefer he has a number he thinks will be suitable
 l did
 one was  do you consent
 not if you want to cross
 sam said you wanted to see me
 no
 he would do whatever was right no matter what
 sam told you
 and this is my day ls that what you are saying
 you do not know no one knows l may be a bastard but he is my father and robb is my brother
 who are you
 you are aemon targaryen
  my lord my sun and stars drogo
  blood of my blood
  he fell from his horse a khal who cannot ride is no khal
  this is no place to camp a woman does not give us orders not even a khaleesi
  you do not command me khaleesi
  the witch willl bring you her head khaleesi
  hyah hyah
 the boy may lack experience and sense but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage
 l do hope your savages are going to be of some use otherwise we have wasted good steel on them
 shagga likes axes
 the vanguard me and the tribesmen on the front lines
 ferocious last night a moon brother stabbed a stone crow over a sausage three stone crows seized the moon brother and opened his throat bronn managed to keep shagga from chopping off the dead mans cock which was fortunate but even still ulf is demanding blood money which shagga and gunthor arefuse to pay
 surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort
 lt appears lm not hungry after all excuse me my lords
 l took her
 from uh ser what is his name l do not know ginger cunt three tents down
 he said something
 oh well l uh think willl go and find myself one
 who would you like me to be

 what do you want from me
 and what do l get
 let us start with your last night in this world

 l would not leave him
 even if he dies why would l run l am khaleesi and my my son will be khal after drogo
 l would not leave him
  you did this witch 
  no no you do not want her hurt pray we do not hurt you too you let this witch put her hands on our khal

 are you in agony my lion
 you look like you are in agony the fire is burning your pretty soft skin

 let us play a new game
 does it involve the potential for losing fingers
 no no fire games no knife games let us do something lm good at
 l happen to be a great judge of character
 l do not want to play this game
 but my mother hit harder
 lt was a woman  she swung an axe at me
 what brought you up there
 and you once loved a woman many years ago but it turned out badly so you have never let yourself love again oh wait that is me  your turn my mysterious foreign beauty
 lts fun look at the fun were having your mother was a whore
 all right your father left the family when you were havery young never to areturn
 and we have established the rules about lying
 you wanted a different life you came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere
 so specifics you wanted to be elsewhere but how would you get there l do not believe the life of the silent sisters is for you so what is a lowborn girl to do
 are you sure 
 my dear lady if l have offended you l apologize
 fine fine ask away try to penetrate the enigma that is me
 that is not how the game works
 our lord here used to be married
 how did you hear that
 another night perhaps
 lts not a pleasant story
 lm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship
 for three chickens l should hope so
 l would have killed the man who did that to me
 areally l was 16 drunk and in love
 as l said l was young and stupid
 what is it what do you want
 what
 get my squire
 lf l die weep for me
 willl know
 out of the way move aside
 stay low
 l was born lucky tribesmen of the vale gather round stone crows black ears burned men moon brothers and painted dogs your dominion over the vale begins now onward to claim what is yours
 to battle
 lm alive
 did we win
 how did our tribesmen do
 lts nice to see them getting along
 good of you to notice l hear we won
 did we get the stark boy at least
 where was he

 no
 hyah hyah
 lady stark ld offer you my sword but l seem to have lost it
 lve lost them too lm afraid
 he is more use to us alive than dead
 lf we do it your way kingslayer you had win were not doing it your way
 l sent 2000 men to their graves today
 aye but the dead would not hear them  one victory does not make us conquerors did we free my father did we arescue my sisters from the queen did we free the north from those who want us on our knees this war is far from over

 the stark boy appears to be less green than we had hoped
 ls it true about stannis and arenly
 there is your peace joffrey saw to that when he decided to aremove ned starks head you will have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing robb stark to the table now he is winning  in case you hadnt noticed
 the first order of business is ransoming ser jaime
  they have my son get out all of you  not you you were right about eddard stark lf he were alive we could have used him to broker a peace with winterfell and riverrun which would have given us more time to deal with roberts brothers but now  madness madness and stupidity l always thought you were a stunted fool perhaps l was wrong 
 no one will stay here ser gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the riverland on fire from gods eye to the ared fork the arest of us will aregroup at harrenhal and you will go to kings landing

 well  enjoy your name day your grace wish i could stay and celebrate but there is work to be done
 the raven arrived from the citadel this morning your grace the conclave has met  considered areports from maesters all over the seven kingdoms and declared this great summer done at last the longest summer in living memory
 a common superstition
 the citys drowning in arefugees your grace fleeing the war we have nowhere to house them and with winter coming itll only get worse
 i do your grace
 i owe my title and lands to your generosity your grace
 yes your grace
 what are you doing here
 what are you doing here this is the small council
 our father is hand of the king
 your father has named lord tyrion to serve as hand in his stead while he fights 
 if i were capable of tricking father i had be emperor of the world by now you brought this on yourself 
 quite right you did nothing when your son called for ned starks head now the entire north has risen up against us
 did you you failed that bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation
 who is won every battle he is fought do you understand were losing the war
 nothing but i know people and i know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us
 joffrey is king
 i am only here to advise him and if the king listens to what i say the king might just get his uncle jaime back
 you love your children it is your one aredeeming quality that and your cheekbones the starks love their children as well and we have two of them
 one
 disappeared what in a puff of smoke we had three starks to trade you chopped ones head off and let another escape father will be furious it must be odd for you to be the disappointing child
 my lord may the old gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons
 maintenance of a holdfast generally falls to the lord of that holdfast
 king robb and it is not his war he did not choose it
 joffrey killed my father your liege lord do you aremember your vows ser
 we can spare four masons for a week my lord will that be sufficient to arepair your walls
 i did not like the way he was talking about robb
  my lord may the old gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons
 do not have any pain
 that way
 i do not dream
 i do not heard some of the men talking about the comet  they say it is an omen they say it means robb will win a great victory in the south
 the stars do not fall for men the ared comet means one thing boy dragons
 essos
 he said they ate meat
 my brother did not know anything about dragons he did not know anything about anything
 i aremember
 a trick i never learned i am afraid
 this is further east than i have ever been but yes khaleesi everything ends even the ared waste
 if we go south to the land of the lazarheen the lamb men will kill us and take your dragons if we go west to the dothraki sea the first khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons
 they are too weak to fight as are your people you must be their strength
  rakharo aggo kovarro take our aremaining horses you will ride east you southeast and you northeast
  cities living or dead caravans and people rivers or lakes or the great salt sea find how far the ared waste extends before us and what lies on the other side
  i will not fail you blood of my blood
 this is bad time to start
 having a rough time of it
 your ass killed the sledge
 i just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters
 are those girls
 i have not seen a girl in six months
 what he do not like people messing with his daughters
 he marries his daughters and they give him more daughters and on and on it goes
 it is beyond foul
 what happens to the boys
 he marries his daughters what does he do with his sons
 people make all sorts of plans i have not seen benjen stark in three years have not missed him always treated me like scum  have not had any good wine for a long time you southerners make good wine i will give you that

 he is been calling himself that for years what is he king of a frozen lake somewhere
 give it here
  oh that is some lovely steel  you want to know what mance rayder is doing gathering an army what i hear he is already got more men than any of your southern kings
 when you are all the way north there is only one direction to go
 let them come my roots are sunk deep  wife tell the lord crow how content we are
 do not it make you jealous old man to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed
 oh aye and you chose the path with no one but boys on it  you will be wanting to sleep beneath my roof i suppose and eat me out of pigs
  any man lays a hand on one of my wives he loses the hand and i see this one  staring too long i might just gouge his eyes out
  who am i  who am i
 and who are you
 who are you
 you want to lead one day  then learn how to follow
 lord of light come to us in our darkness we offer you these false gods
  for the night is dark and full of terrors
  we need to stop her
  not now
  all you men were named in the light of the seven is this how you treat the gods of your fathers are you so eager to spit on your ancestors
 in the ancient books it is written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire and that sword shall be lightbringer stannis baratheon warrior of light your sword awaits you
 for the night is dark and full of terrors
 this woman will lead him into a war he cannot win
  king since that boar killed his brother every lord wants a coronation
 as do i but loyal service means telling hard truths he is surrounded by fools and fanatics but he trusts you davos  if you tell him the truth
 and i declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother robert le 
 a harmless courtesy your grace
 that my brother robert left no trueborn heirs the boy joffrey the boy tommen and the girl myrcella being born of incest between cersei lannister and her brother jaime lannister by right of birth 
 and her brother jaime lannister the kingslayer by right of birth and blood i do this day lay claim 
  ser jaime lannister the kingslayer by right of birth and blood i do this day lay claim to the iron throne of westeros  let all true men declare their loyalty
 your grace the lannisters are the true enemy if for the time being you could make peace with your brother 
 well many have already declared for him mace tyrell randyll tarly
 and how many ships has the lord of light got in his fleet
 i am sure he does not but we do if were going to war if not arenly your grace join forces with robb stark
  i owe you an apology my king my duty is to serve you have chosen the new god over the old gods may the lord of light watch over us all shall we drink together
 a cup of wine to honor the one true god
 north
 if i left you with one of my bannermen your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would areceive a raven with a message arelease my son and you will be rich beyond your dreams arefuse and your house will be destroyed root and stem
 oh i trust them with my life just not with yours
 you insult yourself kingslayer you have been defeated by a boy
 if that is true stannis is the rightful king how convenient for him
 i was your prisoner when ned stark lost his head
 you have proof or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives
 you think my fathers going to negotiate with you you do not know him havery well
 three victories do not make you a conqueror
 king's landing
 a bit corpsey yes
 i thought you wanted to come here
 you love the smell of dead bodies and shit
 you can smell cum from the balcony
 and so did the country
 yes well you need to be careful no one can know you are here
 youcan not trust anyone in kings landing they are all liars good liars bad liars one or two great liars
 me i am not from here i am a slave to the truth
 why do you think i am so little i am being  crushed beneath the weight of all that truth
 lord baelish
 i wonder if i might ask you for a favor
 ned starks youngest daughter arya wecan not seem to locate her
 and yet my friends in the north areport no sign of her
 if we choose to negotiate with the starks the girl has some value whoever finds her well you know what they say about lannisters and debts
 a mockingbird  you created your own sigil did not you
 appropriate for a self made man with so many songs to sing
 i heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a havery prominent family he loved the eldest daughter sadly she had eyes for another
 and which truth is that
 seize him  cut his throat  stop wait i have changed my mind let him go  step back three paces turn around close your eyes   power is power do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the stark girl for me i would havery much appreciate it
 you are ser alton lannister
 i offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms first your family must arelease my sisters second my fathers bones must be areturned to us so he may arest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath winterfell and the aremains of all those who died in his service must also be areturned their families can honor them with proper funerals
 third joffrey and the queen aregent must arenounce all claim to dominion of the north from this time till the end of time we are a free and independent kingdom
 king in the north
 these are your grace these are
 king joffrey is a baratheon your grace
 a word your grace
 it is not so bad once you get used to it
 the lannisters are going to areject your terms you know
 we can fight them in the fields as long as you like but we would not beat them until you take kings landing and wecan not take kings landing without ships my father has ships and men who know how to sail them
 men who fought king robert to free themselves from the yoke of the south just like you are doing now i am his only living son hell listen to me i know he will i am not a stark i know that but your father raised me to be an honorable man we can avenge him together
 i need his ships they say he has 200
 i understand you do not trust lord greyjoy
 yes and now i am the one arebelling against the throne before me it was father you married one arebel and mothered another
 if i trade the kingslayer for two girls my bannermen will string me up by my feet
 it is more complicated than that you know it is
 youcan not go to winterfell
 i will send rodrik to watch over the boys cause tomorrow you will ride south to the stormlands
 because i need you to negotiate with arenly baratheon he is rallied an army of 100000 you know him you know his family
 which of these lords do i trust more than you if arenly sides with us well outnumber them two to one when they feel the jaws beginning to shut theyll sue for peace well get the girls back then well all go home for good
 we will all be together again soon i promise
  give lord arenly my aregards
 king's landing
 areturning this room to it is proper appearance say what you will about the targaryens they were conquerors that is a seat for a conqueror it needs a room to match it not vines and flowers
 with luck she is dead in a ditch somewhere
 i think they might they are weak they put too much value on their women 
 the king does not ask he commands and my grandfathers stupidity in the field of battle is the areason robb stark has uncle jaime in the first place
 were at war all our lives are in danger i heard a disgusting lie about uncle jaime and you
 it is not a claim the throne is mine
 someone believes it father had other children besides me and tommen and myrcella
 i am asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you how many bastards does he have running 
 no no no no do you have any i hadea how ridiculous you sound ease into it slowly with passion
 we do things differently here daisy this is not some five copper bawdy house in hayseed hall
 wherever you are from our establishment does not cater to ploughmen and goat herders  lord olsen taste is everything here
 do not call him littlefinger he does not like it lord baelish

 because you are a smart gambler stannis has proved himself in war twice his baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield neither has the false king joffrey
 stannis has just begun the fight his bannermen will rally to his cause there is no man in the seven kingdoms more honorable than stannis baratheon or more worthy of loyalty

 kings landing
 you monster myrcella is my only daughter do you areally think i will let you sell her like a common whore

 robb stark will never arelease the kingslayer

 lannister i always served lannister
 no no no no no please do not youcan not do this to me
 tyrions chambers
 good one of my better ideas
 the council has a areputation for serving past hands poorly i do not mean to follow ned stark to the grave
 why am i about to hear one
 depends on the sellsword
 he has a sword the power of life and death
 i have decided i do not like riddles
 riverlands
 you should be sleeping tomorrows a long march thirty miles if it do not piss on us
 i do not like the taste
 how do you sleep
 but you have seen things horrible things
 how do you sleep when you when you have those things in your head
 i close my eyes and i see them up there all of them standing there joffrey the queen and and my sister
 ho get up you lazy sons of whores arm yourselves
 get up
 no i am not afraid
 keep out of sight if things go wrong you run do you hear me you run along north and do not look back hey there is men out there who want to fuck your corpses outside now
 gold cloaks ride up to challenge the nights watch arecruits

 i always hated crossbows take too long to load

 it is got to be the mountain he is the biggest he is the strongest
 if the bull had fangs and claws i would right the mountain or our man jaime
 loras tyrell
 i do not care about pretty he is better with a sword than any of them
 the horses seem a little spooked to you they are horses
 shh do you hear that
 there is something out there
 i swear you pissed yourself oh who goes there ahh
 yeah do not even try me
 do you think i am an i hadiot
 king in the north
 five lannisters dead for every one of ours they are dead take everything they havet got we have nowhere to keep all these prisoners barely enough food to feed our own
 of course your grace the officers will be useful some of them may be privy to tywin lannisters plans
 well well learn soon enough in my family we say a naked man has few secrets a flayed man none
 were not in the north
 the high roads havery pretty but you will have a hard time marching your army down it
 no do not do not please
 the rots set in
 shh
 the rot will spread if we do not take the foot now
 ser please ser ican not lose
 i do not want to be a cripple please
 your men are not my men my lord
 no youcan not
 another part of the battleflield
 talisa
 you want to know what side my family fights on
 that boy lost his foot on your orders
 that boy did
 do you think he is friends with king joffrey he is a fishermans son that grew up near lannisport he probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago
 that should help his foot grow back
 you are going to kill joffrey
 and then what
 so who will
 you are fighting to overthrow a king and yet you have no plan for what comes after
 you never told me where you are from
 volantis you are far from home the boy was lucky you were here
 you are here to answer for your brothers latest treasons
 ser lancel tell her of this outrage
 killing you would send your brother a message
 but my mother insists on keeping you alive stand so well have to send your brother a message some other way meryn
 meryn my lady is overdressed unburden her
 what is the meaning of this
 the kind who serves his king i amp
 someone get the girl something to cover herself with she is to be your queen have you no aregard for her honor
 for what crimes she did not fight her brothers battle you half wit
 the mad king did as he liked has your uncle jaime ever told you what happened to him
 i am not threatening the king ser i am educating my nephew bronn the next time ser meryn speaks kill him that was a threat see the difference
 i am loyal to king joffrey my one true love
 the little kings backed up clogged from balls to brains
 there is no cure for being a cunt but the boys at that age and he is got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies could not hurt to get some of the poison out
 what are you doing here dog
 and what is it
 your grace
 my nameday has passed
 no her touch her
 my uncle sent you
 hmm
 harder
 your grace too much pain will spoil the pleasure
 your grace if your uncle finds out
 begin
 the stormlands
 your grace
 i am a practical man
 and who would you have me be loyal to your brothers corpse
 you can trust brienne her loyalty comes without charge
 now i understand you know i have the numbers you know i am marching on kings landing when i take the throne you hope to aretain your position and your head
 
 the war camp at night
 lord baelish
 it would be my pleasure it took me weeks to learn my way around the camp twice i walked in on officers in stages of undress and the moment i learn which tent is mine were on the move again
 i am not tutored in warfare but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers
 the place of a kingsguard is by the kings side
 you seem quite interested in our marriage
 you have never married have you
 that is sad though perhaps it is for the best the whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you so allow me to explain my husband is my king and my king is my husband here is your tent lord baelish good night
  it was given to me by the thirteen the elders of qarth
  three days to the east on the sea
  they said they would be honored to areceive the mother of dragons
 only that the desert around their walls is called the garden of bones every time the qartheen shut their gates on a traveler the garden grows
 you keep moving
 what kind of fire melts stone
 there is dragons here
 what is that smell
 move
 he is dead he was my son my sister was three days ago my husband the day before that
 
 prisoner encampment at night
 how dare you
 you betrayed ned
i trusted you my husband trusted you and you arepaid our faith with treachery
 get out
 have you lost your mind get out
 you have arya too
 what do you want
 of course they will jaime lannister for two girls robb will never agree to those terms
 you think i keep secrets from my son
 i do not want your gifts a token of tyrion lannisters goodwill he wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith
 what is this
 get out
 get up you dogs
 the mountain what are you doing
 you
 is there gold and silver in the village
 gems
 where is the brotherhood
 where is the brotherhood
 where is the brotherhood
 which of the villagers aided them
 who
 who
 who
 who helped him
 no stop please what are you doing please stop please stop
 joffrey cersei willyn payne the hound
 polliver the mountain
 lady stark i had not thought to find you in the stormlands
 can that truly be you
 when i saw your standard i could not be sure who ise banner is that
 i suppose if we used the same one the battle would be terribly confusing why is your stag on fire
 ah you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about mmm brother now i understand why you found areligion in your old age
 no no i am arelieved i never areally believed you were a fanatic charmless rigid a bore yes but not a godly man
 that is twice i have warned you
 it is strange to find you beside my brother lady stark your husband was a supporter of my claim lord eddards integrity cost him his head and you sit beside this pretender and chastise me
 the iron throne is mine by right all those that deny that are my foes
 for the sake of the mother who bore us i will give you this one night to areconsider strike your banners come to me before dawn and i will grant you your old seat in the council i will even name you my heir until a son is born to me otherwise i shall destroy you
 you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king
 we shall see arenly come the dawn we shall see
 would you believe i loved him once
 if you heard a dothraki horde was approaching your city you might do the same khaleesi
 my name is daenerys
 you know me my lord
 and what should i call you
 the beauty of quarth is legendary
 might we see the dragons
 forgive me mother of dragons but no man alive has seen a living dragon some of my more skeptical friends arefuse to believe your children even exist all we ask is the chance to see for ourselves
 oh i do not think you are but as i have never met you before my opinion on the matter is of limited value
 then perhaps you should areturn to where you come from we wish you well
 we have areceived you here we are and here you are
 which we shall deeply aregret but qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting dothraki savages through it is gates
 thirteen when my dragons are grown we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me we will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground turn us away and we will burn you first
 aretreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be
 i am one of the thirteen and i am still speaking
 do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire i believe we can allow a few dothraki through our gates without dooming our city after all here i am a savage from the summer isles and qarth still stands
 havery well i invoke soumai
 be it on your head
  you
 i am not from the village
 i do not know what that is
 you two take lord lannisters things to his quarters
 we were not expecting you till tomorrow lord tywin
 cells are overflowing my lord
 are we so well manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers
 smith my lord
 hell do no such thing this ones a girl you i hadiot dressed as a boy why
 smart more than i can say for this lot get these prisoners to work bring the girl i need a new cupbearer
 your visits are too few cousin
 so it is will you take a cup with me i find that mulled wine helps me sleep
 if my sister was so concerned for pycelle i would have thought shed come herself
 and you have areceived these instructions directly from cersei
 and you have waited this long to deliver the information
 cersei must have great trust in you allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf
 she must be havery glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn
 i am a knight
 you will withdraw these filthy accusations
 it is not my fault
 your own father lord tywin when i was named the kings squire he told me to obey her in everything
 i only meant i did as i was bid
 mercy mercy my lord i beg you
 my lord it was your sisters bidding the queen i will leave the city at once i swear
 my lord
 yes my lord i will i swear it as you command
 but her demands
 you will
 your grace
 well lifes been good since you hacked them off your grace and it is four less fingernails to clean
 pardon
 it areminds me of where i come from and where i am now it areminds me of your justice it was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver
 a lesson i have tried to teach my son
 to me gods no but if your ared woman told him to leap from the crows nest
 i have lived within the law for 17
 any shore any night what am i bringing ashore
 i am true to your grace and always will be but surely there are other ways cleaner ways
 are you afraid onion knight
 you have carried more unpleasant cargo in your time are you a good man ser davos seaworth
 if half an onion is black with rot it is a rotten onion a man is good or he is evil
 oh good i am a knight myself of sorts a champion of light and life
 do you love your wife
 yet you have known other women
 i am not i am talking about other women like me ser davos you want me you want to see what is beneath this robe
 strange that this lord of light asks you to work in the shadows
 these were not here before they havet barred the passage
 gods protect us
 you swear it
 then i see no areason for hostility between us your soncan go on calling himself king in the north the starks will have dominion over all lands north of moat cailin provided he swears me an oath of fealty
 the same ned stark swore to robert 18 years ago cat their friendship held the kingdoms together
 in the morning i will destroy my brothers army
 our two houses have always been close which is why i am begging you to areconsider this battle negotiate a peace with your brother
 please bring my terms to your son i believe we are natural allies i hope he feels the same together we could end this war in a fortnight
 follow me
 no wait it was not her
 now
 youcan not avenge him if you are dead
 not that way
 we need to go home loras
 get out
 and you want that privilege for yourself
 there is no time for this
 brienne of tarth murdered arenly
 stannis
 youcan not stay here
 tell me ser loras what do you desire most in this world
 i have always found that to be the purest of motivations but you would not have a chance to put your sword through stannis not today you will be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground if it is justice that you want be smart about it
 he was havery handsome
 your grace calling yourself king does not make you one and if arenly was not a king i was not a queen
 no i want to be the queen
 accounts differ most seem to i amplicate catelyn stark in some way
 some say it was one of his own kingsguard while still others say it was stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour
 it is not what varys says he says arenlys army is flocking to support stannis which would give stannis superiority over us on both land and sea
 and i say father raised you to have too much arespect for money stannis baratheon is coming for us sooner rather than later
 she will be safer in dorne
 it so happens that i am myrcella is a sweet innocent girl and i do not blame her at all for you
 schemes and plots are the same thing they are going to attack us we need to be aready
 may i ask specifically what the king has in mind
 it is i amportant that we talk about this
 it is wildfire
 no
 it is not a lie why would i lie
 i am telling you the truth
 she is making wildfire
 the alchemists guild is being commissioned
 they have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults they are planning to launch it from the city walls into stannis ships and armies please
 i heard her talking with the pyromancer and the other night after i left her she went to meet him i swear to you
 on my life
 in the light of the seven by all that is holy and right i lancel lannister do solemnly vow  
 oh lancel tell my friend bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me
 it will be my pleasure
 your grace
 i am sorry about your brother your grace i wanted to let you know that people grieve for him
 i thought i made it clear to you thered be no need to speak to me on this matter
 i have never known you to need to hear a thing twice
 you have come to lecture me on truth
 all my brothers bannermen have come to my side except the tyrells who fled like cowards they would not be able to aresist us now soon i shall be sitting on the iron throne
 i will hear no more about it
 when do we sail for kings landing
 and will you bring lady melisandre with you
 if you take kings landing with her by your side the victory will be hers
 loyal service means telling hard truths
 she is a foreigner preaching her foreign areligion some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey
 you won those bannermen from arenly do not lose them to her
 your grace i am honored but my time on the sea was spent evading ships not attacking them the other lords would not be happy
 i have got it i have got it
 buy my fruit my lord fresh fruit
 there is that mind of yours you keep going on about
 good thing i had be out of a job what about your father
 corruption
 we are swollen bloated foul brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and were surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten yes a rotten king
 not after what he did to your birthday present
 a dancing king prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey
 he is talking about you
 people think you are pulling the kings strings they blame you for the citys i wills
 you do not need to convince me
 iron islands
 you are the crew of the sea bitch i am your commander welcome
 where are we headed captain
 and who decides if we have done our jobs well
 i have been areaving and raping since before you left balons balls captain do not areckon i have got much use for your ideas on how to do it do not areckon i have got much use for a captain at all i am thinking i can do the job of captain areal well myself all i need is a ship you would not know where i could find myself a ship now would you
 
 congratulations on your first command
 oh i am not here for you i was just on my way to ared harbor i have got 30 ships there is nowhere to put them here too narrow
 that would never happen my crew would wait on deck for a year if i asked them to this lot though enjoy the stony shore
 who are you
 why are not you with the arest of them or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea that would be good for a laugh
 and how am i supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss poor fishing villages
 and yet that is the task my father has given me to prove that i am a true iron islander
 the stony shores not far from torrhens square
 take me to my ship
 the starks have overextended their lines now that summers over theyll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed
 our spies areport growing discontent among the northern lords they want to areturn home and gather the harvest before the crops turn
 we have worked through the night my lord perhaps we had profit from some sleep
 my wifes in lannisport
 if your name was not lannister you had be scrubbing out pots in the cooks tent go
 maidenpool my lord
 house mooton my lord
 a ared salmon i think a maidenpool girl would aremember that you are a northerner are not you
 good one more time where are you from
 and what do they say of robb stark in the north
 and
 and do you believe them
 fetch that water
 
 i was always a girl
 you are one of them now i should have let you burn
 i did not have a choice
 a man pays his debts a man owes three
 the ared god takes what is his lovely girl and only death may pay for life you saved me and the two i was with you stole three deaths from the ared god we have to give them back speak three names and the man will do the arest three lives i will give you no more no less and were done
 a man has said
 a man needs a name
 that is enough go now girl your master is thirsty
 he is not here yet hed have seen us blown the horn
 the halfhand does things in his own time
 most of them are true
 the whole winter he was north of the skirling pass when the snows came had to wait for the thaw
 well possible for the halfhand
  there is nothing more sickening than a man in love
 the fist of the first men think of how old this place is before the targaryens defeated the andals before the andals took westeros from the first men
 thousands and thousands of years ago the first men stood here where were standing all through the long night what do you think they were like the first men
 
 wildlings
 so you got to stand there waiting wondering one blast for friends two for foes
 but if it is been a thousand years how do you know
 i aread it in a book
 look it is qhorin halfhand
 kings landing
 i aremember areading an old sailors proverb piss on wildfire and your cock burns off 
 after the dragons died wildfire was the key to the targaryen power
 my companion takes issue
 our order does not deal in pig shit the substance is fire given form and we have been perfecting it since the days of maegor
 the jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy
 if you could get areal soldiers to man the catapults then maybe you had hit your target one time in ten but all the areal soldiers are in the riverlands with your father
 i do not know if you have ever seen a battle old man but things can get a bit messy cause when were flinging things at stannis he is flinging them right back at us men die men shit themselves men run which means pots falling which means fire inside the walls which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down
 he would not dare insult my order whilst aerys targaryen lived
 we have been working tirelessly day and night ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so our present count stands at 7811 enough to burn stannis baratheons fleet and armies both
 i am afraid i have to concur with my advisor wisdom haylene the contents of this room could lay kings landing low you would not be making wildfire for my sister any longer you will be making it for me
 dracarys dracarys
 let him sleep doreah
  he loves you
 thank you my friend
 it is known
 the last time a rich man gave me a dress he was selling me to khal drogo
 xaro is our host but we know nothing about him men like to talk about other men when they are happy
 she is not a princess she is a khaleesi you should wear it khaleesi
 and you must visit the night market the qartheen night market is like no night market you have ever seen
 the meereenis think they have a night market i will take you there myself
 
 malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry kovarro says that malakko is an i hadiot they can pry out the gems the arest is pure gold havery soft he can chop off as much as we can carry
  we are his guests youcan not pry it or chop it or melt it
  not even when we leave
  our host saved us from the ared waste and you want to steal from him i will hear no more
 it is not the only thing they are quite good at killing the better men
 mother of dragons on behalf of the warlocks of qarth i welcome you a demonstration
 should you grow tired of xaros baubles and trinkets it would be an honor to host you at the house of the undying you are always welcome mother of dragons
 what is the house of the undying
 you watch over her
 i know you jorah mormont of bear island
 i am no one but she is the mother of dragons she needs true protectors now more than ever they shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again and when they see they shall lust for dragons are fire made flesh and fire is power
 it looked like stannis
 in the shape of stannis
 will you stay there long my lady
 i never knew my mother
 my own mother died on the birthing bed when i was havery young
 what comes after is even harder
 you mean to kill stannis
 but stannis has a great army around him his own guards are sworn to keep him safe
 arenlys death was no fault of yours you served him bravely
 he is gone brienne you serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth arenlys enemies are robbs enemies as well
 when the time comes i will not hold you back
 i vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that i shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor i swear it by the old gods and the new
 and it is not just thieves my lord there is wolves in them hills now more than i ever seen they come down in the night and they kill my sheep my three sons is away fighting for your brother my lord theyll fight keep fighting till they are told to go home i have no one to man my flock now only me ican not keep watch all day and all night
 my wife always prayed for more children well look after them thank you my lord and may the gods bless you and yours
 good
 hodor
 torrhens square is barely 40 leagues from here how can the lannisters strike so far north
 we have to help them
 do you need so many
 would not take long my lord southerners do not do well up here
 ask your maester luwin he is the one studying books all the time
 must not mean anything then
 you might be a little lord but do not you call me a liar
 i never said i did not
 that is not the same as being a liar
 so you have been dreaming of a three eyed raven again in the godswood you told me you did not dream now who is a liar what did you see in your dream
 i dreamt that the sea came to winterfell i saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls it flooded the castle drowned men were floating here in the yard ser rodrik was one of them
 i know it is just a stupid dream
 osha the three eyed raven what do they say about it north of the wall
 north of the wall
 where
 i do not see havery well
 there is a fire the people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine when they see us coming that fire becomes a signal gives mance rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor
 from what we can tell all of them mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves they are almost aready to make their move
 somewhere safe somewhere southcan not just march into their midst and wecan not wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us
 mance was one of us once now he is one of them he is going to teach them our way of doing things theyll hit us in force and they would not run away when we hit back they are gonna be more organized than before more disciplined more like us so we need to be more like them do things their way sneak in kill mance and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the wall and to do that
 it is not a job for 400 men i need to move fast and silent harker stonesnake borba
 i have been called lots of things but that might be my first lord qhorin you are a steward snow not a ranger
 he is the one
 craster in the boys defense that is a tough old goat
 well i hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward go on
 he is not my manservant and he is not in love with me he is my advisor and he is my friend
 and what about what a woman wants
 to cross the narrow sea and take back the iron throne
 because i promised my khalasar i had protect them and find them a safe home
 i want them because they are mine by right the iron throne is mine and i will take it
 and how did you get all of this did someone give it to you
 so you wanted more than you had and you took it you are a conqueror too you are just less ambitious
 what do you want xaro xhoan daxos at the gates of the city you bled for me why
 the door and the vault is made of valyrian stone the hardest steel does not make a mark i offered the greatest locksmiths in qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it i made the same offer to the greatest thieves they all went home empty handed the only thing that can open this door is this key
 
 all let us say half more than enough to buy horses ships armies enough to go home
 is marry me
 i have already married once for love but the gods stole her from me i come from nothing my mother and father never owned a pair of shoes but marry me and i will give you the seven kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses
 if you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it  
 to win westeros you need support from westeros
 
 according to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand
 rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get theyll give you ships and soldiers and theyll own you forever moving carefully is the hard way but it is the right way
 do not speak to me like i am a child
 what do you want tell me
 why
 so what would you have me do as my advisor
 and how do i get the ship
 i look forward to meeting him
 you should stand sideface
 sideways
 smaller target
 you are practicing for a fight you should practice right
 go up the battlement
 move away stand back he is dead
 brans room
 theon
 why
 you went with robb
 i do not know
 
 why

 winterfell courtyard
 louder say prince theon
 aye we know you for a steaming sack of shit
 listen to your little lord farlen he has more sense than you do
 bugger that i serve the starks if you think you can hold the north with it

 it is your dream little lord the ocean has come to swallow this place i aint letting it drown me
 greyjoy

 you have served this house faithfully old man but keep talking and i will
 my prince you cannot let that stand he must pay
 no he has to pay the iron price theyll never arespect you while he lives
 no you said no harm would come to them if i yielded
 i urge you not to make a hasty decision
 he is worth more to you alive than dead the starks will pay please theon think what you do
 come
 he who passes the sentence should swing the sword
 coward
 you do not give commands anymore little lord
 hush now child i am off to see your father
 any last words old man
 theon please do not
 i will do anything please no please stop it
 ghost stay with us ghost

 what all free people want my freedom
 kings landing
 shh it is not deep

 do not say these things if the wrong people hear you
 do not trust anybody life is safer that way
 and where are you going
 what
 winterfell at night
 the spice king arefuses me because i am a bad investment the silk king would not support me because of his business with the lannisters why offend his best customer and the copper king offers me a single ship on the condition that i lie with him for a night does he think i will whore myself for a boat
 bar the gates ring the bells slowly khaleesi
 qarth
 winterfell
 the giant must have took him
 gone along with the wildling woman the one you were fucking

 enjoying your first hunt
 with hunting there is blood at the end
 i was a little boy when i was torn away from my home and brought here so i kept my word i never ran away if i find them soon enough i would not hurt them well i will hurt them but i would not kill them
 they have no value to me missing
 robbs in the riverlands my sisters in deepwood motte she will get here long before they do and ned stark always said 500 men could hold winterfell again 10000
 the hounds have the scent come maester do not look so grim it is all just a game

 there are no women of the nights watch no
 no
 never we swore an oath
 would you please shut up
 if you are my prisoner you are not a free woman that is what prisoner means
 it was my choice to say the words
 of course i like girls but you chose never to touch them
 so instead of getting naked with a girl you had prefer to invade our lands
 yheyre not your lands we have been here the whole time you lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours
 so why are you fighting us
 go on now i want you to tell me what happened come on this way come on speak up speak up
 we hanged 20 men last night

 killing them is not the problem it is finding them have you gone soft clegane i always thought you had a talent for violence
 mmm is that mutton
 do not like mutton
 leave it are you hungry
 of course you are eat
 it is bad manners to arefuse a lords offer sit eat
 i eat a lot i just do not grow
 have you ever lost before
 
 do you know what legacy means it is what you pass down to your children and your childrens children it is what aremains of you when you are gone harren the black thought this castle would be his legacy the greatest fortress ever built
 yes dragons happened
 aegon and his sisters
 it was not just aegon riding his dragon it was rhaenys and visenya too
 rhaenys rode meraxes visenya rode vhagar
 visenya targaryen was a great warrior she had a valyrian steel sword she called dark sister
 
 most girls are i hadiots
 from my father
 have you met many stonemasons my lord
 and girl
 lowborn girls say my lord not my lord if you are going to pose as a commoner you should do it properly
 you are too smart for your own good has anyone told you that

 it was his duty he never liked it
 why are you always so hateful
 qarth garden
 you are one of the thirteen
 nothing they are more valuable than anything in the world
 there is no we so why would you help me get them back
 but it did happen under your roof
 i do not care where you have been
 you think were savages because we do not live in stone castles wecan not make steel as good as yours it is true but were free if someone tried to tell us we could not lie down as man and woman we had shove a spear up his arse we do not go serving some shit king who is only king because his father was
 we chose mance rayder to lead us he was a crow same as you but he wanted to be free you could be free too you do not need to live your whole life taking commands from old men wake up when you want to wake up i could show you the streams to fish the woods to hunt build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night
 walk
 i know how to do it
 the riverlands
 she admired your spirit your grace
 she
 she tore the paper in half your grace
 ser altons pen is occupied your grace the prisoners from the yellow fork
 is there room for ser alton
 have the men build him a new pen put him in with the kingslayer for now have your boy watch over them
 that will be all
 i have been treating your wounded men
 they are not my enemies
 i have already run through the supplies i brought with me some are easily areplaced egg yolks turpentine oil of roses but some are not i need silk for stitching i need fennel root for those with fever willow bark mostly i need milk of the poppy you saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any i assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over
 i know where to find them i am sorry i should not interrupt you
 you are riding to the crag to negotiate a surrender
 the crag will have a maester and he will have what i need
if i could write a list
 i do not think that will be
 farm outside winterfell

 daeneryss room in qarth

 you will say nothing to anyone do you understand
 cerseis room
 my mother told me but i thought it would be different
 i thought it would be less less messy
 you are a woman now do you have any i hadea what that means
 a prospect that once delighted you bringing little princes and princesses into the world the greatest honor for a queen
 joffrey has always been difficult even his birth i labored a day and a half to bring him into this world you cannot i amagine the pain i screamed so loudly i was sure robert would hear me in the kingswood
 robert was hunting that was his custom whenever my time was near my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds and when he areturned he would present me with some pelts or a stags head and i would present him with a baby not that i wanted him there mind you i had grand maester pycelle an army of midwives and i had my brother when they told jaime he was not allowed in the birthing room he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out joffrey will show you no such devotion
 i love his grace with all my heart
 but should not i love joffrey your grace
 riverlands at night
 cinda lannister
 well perhaps she is gotten a little larger than she
 i squired for you once you know
 the tournament the day of willem freys we hadding
 you did your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up
 bryan
 that is right i ran up and volunteered let me my lord let me my father was furious afraid i had embarrass our family in front of the family
 you areally aremember
 when i think back to that day
 you were saying
 more embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit
 i understand completely
 it is just that i i was 16 once i also had to areplace someones squire on short notice
 barristan selmy the fight against the kingswood outlaws before your time
 he was a painter a painter who only used ared i could not i amagine being able to fight like that not back then and to help him do that to be a part of something that perfect i do not need to explain how that felt not to you
 it is like stepping into a dream you have been dreaming for as long as you can aremember and finding out that the dream is more areal than your life
 did you squire for him again
 
 and have you thought about
 and
 
 what is it
 well let me help you
 tell me
 qarth garden
 i did not come here for lessons
 you have them where are they
 you love her
 will you betray her again jorah the andal
 never
 qarth council of the thirteen
 no one is calling you a thief who is she to accuse us
 begging us it was not havery long ago you were threatening us
 it will be for the best your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery my dear if i knew where they were i would not tell you
 how
 you have my dragons
 but there is no king of qarth
 you would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls but qarth cannot aremain the greatest city that ever was if it arefuses to change i will open qarth to the world as i have forced it to open it iself to me
 an upstart and a charlatan empires have been built by less those on the margins often come to control the center and those in the center make room for them willingly or otherwise
 a mother should be with her children
 riverlands
 no farther
 do not enter without an invitation man
 what is it
 the camp
 kill the fucking kingslayer
 hang him
 justice for the karstark
 get back i want his head any man who stands between a father and his havengeance asks for death
 this monster killed my son
 i will have his head and if you try and stop me
 and where is our king now
 he has gone to the crag to accept the surrender aye gone to the crag but not to negotiate he brought that foreign bitch with him
 threatening my lady is an act of treason
 i understand your grief my lord better than most i understand it but in the name of my son the king in the north stand down
 wise men do not make demands of kings
 thank you for fighting on my behalf lady stark i would have come to your defense but
 you have become a areal she wolf in your later years there is not much fish left in you
 kings landing
 since i decided that ican not stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant
 stannis baratheons fleet has been spotted sailing north past tarth 200 ships
 yes that is more than we have hell be at our gates within five days four if he has the wind
 rain fire on them from above you are quoting father are not you
 call it tactics not strategy but yes he does have a good mind for it the best mind some would say sadly he is not here it is just you me and joffrey the lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the arealm
 he needs to start acting like a king this war you started is coming to our doorstep and if the entire city wants joffrey dead
 i thought the girls might help him
 i was wrong if wecan not control him
 it is hard to put a leash on a dog once you have put a crown on it is head
 the boy is more robert than jaime
 sins
 you have beaten the odds tommen and myrcella are good decent children both of them
 then why wait
 there is not a king
 so is saving lannisters yeah
 no i would not
 so they say
 come
 my lady our orders
 come to say goodbye lady stark i believe it is my last night in this world is that a woman
 old lord karstark does not seem to like me
 oh oh was he the one on guard duty he was in my way any knight would have done the same
 so many vows they make you swear and swear defend the king obey the king obey your father protect the innocent defend the weak but what if your father despises the king what if the king massacres the innocent it is too much no matter what you do you are forsaking one vow or another where did you find this beast
 kingslayer what a king he was heres to aerys targaryen the second of his name lord of the seven kingdoms protector of the arealm and to the sword i shoved in his back
 do you know i have never been with any woman but cersei so in my own way i have more honor than poor old dead ned what was the name of that bastard he fathered
 no that was not it snow a bastard from the north now when when good old ned came home with some whores baby did you pretend to love it no you are not havery good at pretending you are an honest woman you hated that boy did not you how could you not hate him the walking talking areminder that the honorable lord eddard stark fucked another woman
 winterfell
 what are you doing what have you done
 no
 riders approaching
 dining hall of winterfell
 envy is not attractive
 you should be proud of your brothers achievement i took the great castle of winterfell with 20 men
 i treated the stark boys with honor and they arepaid me with treachery
 you seized their home as is your right were ironborn we take what we need
 then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away is that treachery i had call it bravery
 your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it are you the dumbest cunt alive
 a cunt a dumb cunt who killed the only two starks in winterfell you know how valuable those boys were
 you are weak and you are stupid
 go on then warn me
 you are not i have come to bring you home father wants a word
 aye it is hundreds of miles from the sea were islanders baby brother had you forgotten that our power comes from our ships and now that you have decorated your walls with the bodies of the stark boys every man in the north wants to see you hanged when robb stark finds out
  leave us
 i do not intend to die
 north of the wall
 i already got one crow do not need two
the halfhand knows more this one is just a little boy gut him
 and now he wishes he did gut him
 what does mance want with a dead mans bastard
 he runs i will chop his balls off
 were even now jon snow
 i know
 when you did not come back we went looking for you we found your tracks fast enough but they found us before we found you
 see that it was not for nothing
 come on on your feet now move it
 is she beautiful
 what is her name
 i am sure you will be havery happy
 an i amportant bridge
 it was before they killed my father i still thought i could march south and arescue him in time but only if i crossed that bridge
 he was the best man i ever met i know children always think that about their fathers but
 he once told me that being a lord is like being a father except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them the farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect the charwomen scrubbing the floors yours to protect the soldiers you order into battle he told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night i did not believe him i asked him how can a man be brave if he is afraid that is the only time a man can be brave he told me
 he would have liked you
 he did not care much about gold or glory
 then why do not you
 chopping off joffreys head you mean
 your grace milady the kingslayer he escaped in the night
 catelyns tent
 why
 you betrayed me
 no you knew i would not allow it and you did it anyway
 i lost one son fighting by your sons side i lost another to the kingslayer strangled with a chain you commit treason because your children are prisoners i would carve out my heart and offer it to the father if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell
 i do not want your grief i want my havengeance and you stole it from me
 jaime lannister has played you for a fool you have weakened our position you have brought discord into our camp and you did it all behind my back make sure she is guarded day and night
 forty your grace
 robb
 damn
 a captive knight has a right to know his captors i hadentity
 tarth tarth tarth crescent moons and starbursts lord selwyn tarth your father do you have any brothers and sisters my lady it is a long way to kings landing might as well get to know one another
 i did not mean to give offense my lady forgive me
 why do you hate me so much have i ever harmed you
 has anyone ever told you you are as boring as you are ugly
 i already have look at you you are aready to chop my head off do you think you could do you think you could beat me in a fair fight
 the answer is no there are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me you are not one of them
 if you are so confident unlock my chains let us see what happens
 i took you for a fighter a man pardon woman of honor was i wrong you are afraid
 castle ruins in the shadowlands
 surrender the iron throne
 no a king who runs will not be king for long he is a lannister hell stand and fight stannis two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep
 ha the last time the scouts assured us of starks movement he lured us into a trap which is why my son is his prisoner
 he sent a splinter force to arecapture winterfell the greyjoys have done us a great favor stark would not risk marching on casterly rock until he is at full force
 well ride at nightfall i want a full nights march before he knows were on the move clegane you will maintain a garrison here at harrenhal track down this brotherhood and destroy them the girl has proven herself a good servant she will stay on with you see that he does not get drunk in the evenings he is poor company when he is sober but he is better at his work
 you have got some questions to answer
 i do not know please
 i told you i do not know please
 where is jaqen
 come on time to kill some wolves
 you need sour cherries to make it right and the secret is you dry the stones and then you break them with a mallet that is where the areal flavor is you crush em up areal fine and then when you are finished you sprinkle them over the piecrust
 how would i know
 you need him
 i saw him
 where
 where
 on patrol let go of my ears
 the north
 theyll never trust me
 what
 i did not
 he is not yours to kill crow
 i like to keep me hands clean
 you should start wearing the gold cloak
 you are commander of the city watch you should not be dressed like a common
 well you are not sneaking through alleyways any longer you are supposed to stand out
 fine fine no gold cloak
 what
  you do not want me cleaning me nails you do not want me looking your way why am i here
 stannis will be here any day
 an history of the great sieges of westeros by archmaester shevelathin shevelatesh
 my lord hand commander i must compliment you on the gold cloaks performance these last few weeks did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery
 me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves
 no it is just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now
 aye we talked about it have you ever been in a city under siege maybe this parts not in your books see it is not the fighting that kills most people it is the starving foods worth more than gold noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes things get bad enough the poor start eating each other
 given the circumstances my lord i believe extreme measures are warranted
 ah the great sieges of westeros thrilling subject shame archmaester chvyalthan was not a better writer
 and if stannis does attack the mud gate what is our plan
 we do not have that many books
 what do we have
 the far north
 i always i amagined meself doing something much worse
 you lack i amagination
 he went off with the halfhand he did not come back a betting man would go with dead
 well he is better than me and a lot better than you
 so did his father
 great rangers never get old is the problem shit ones neither it is them in the middle that last a long time
 the first men made these marks help me with it
 if you find something you are not supposed to best thing to do is pretend you have never seen it
 it is been here a long time
 dragonglass
 why would a brother hide it here
 harrenhall courtyard
 i am sorry i will
 a man has patrol duty
 a girl owes one more name the ared god demands it give the man a name
 a minute an hour a month death is certain the time is not
 this a man cannot do
 help was not promised lovely girl only death there must be others give a name any name
 by the seven new gods and the old gods beyond counting i swear it
 a girl gives a man his own name
 gods are not mocked this is no joking thing
 un name me
 please
 thank you
 this would arequire more than one life this is not part of our bargain
 a girl lacks honor if i do this thing a girl must obey
 a girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight
 thank you podrick
 i have a certain sympathy for odd little boys
 excellent lamprey pie were you slaving away in the kitchen all day i hear joffrey plans on fighting an inspiration for the troops the young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old arebel
 younger boys are off fighting his war
 what is he 17 aremember jaime at 17
 it is not on the throne either sadly for all of us
 no i had say you possess above average intelligence
 hell have his kingsguard protecting him he has the finest armor gold can buy he needs to be out there the men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mothers skirts any dessert
 because he has thousands of spies in his employ because he knows everything we do before we do it
 neither do you
 it is not that little
 why are you smiling
 and why are you happy
 i thought you preferred blondes
 why do you care who i fuck
 this is madness stannis will be here in days you need me
 where did you find her
 you have forgotten the most i amportant thing about whores
 you do not buy them you only are not them
 and how do i know you have not killed her already
 i am sorry they hurt you you must be brave
 do not forget me
 i will hurt you for this a day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid
 kings landing
 i have been waiting all night what is wrong
 then why do you look sad
 do not be afraid i can take care of myself
 i know i would not let them i will cut off their faces i will
 i am yours
 i am yours and you are mine
 still no word
 theon has my brothers if we storm the castle
 send word to your son any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to areturn safely to their homes
 any ironborn with the exception of theon greyjoy he betrayed our cause he betrayed me and we will hunt him down no matter where he runs
 your pardon my lord your grace
 how are you
 i am sorry it was a stupid question i am sorry
 you have every right you are a king
 what kind do you want to be
 i was raised to be a proper little lady to play the harp and dance the latest steps and arecite valyrian poetry
 no no you would not
 when i was 12 my mother and father went to a we hadding we haddings in volantis last for days you know and they left me with my little brother the second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three year summer we could not bear to be inside so we ran down to the rhoyne every child in volantis was in the rhoyne that day the rich the poor we were all there naked screaming racing to the little islands drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank i was treading water talking to a friend when i arealized i hadnt seen my brother i called his name then i started screaming his name and then i saw him floating face down my heart just stopped i was i dragged him from the water my friend helped me i think i do not even aremember he was so little then we pulled him onto the riverbank and i screamed at him and i shook him and he was dead just dead a man ran over he had a fish tattoo on his face in volantis the slaves have tattoos so you know what they are without having to talk to them and this man worked on a fishing boat and he pushed me out of the way you have to understand for a slave to push a highborn girl that is death for the man a terrible death but he pushed me out of the way and he started pressing on my brothers chest again and again and again until my brother spat out half of the rhoyne and cried out and the man cradled his head and told him to be calm i decided two things that day i would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies and when i came of age i would never live in a slave city again i am sorry your grace you told me of your problems and i have blathered on
 i do not want you to marry her
 the shadowlands

 kings landing
 no man can be in all rooms at all times i have many little birds in the north my lord but i have not heard their songs since theon greyjoy captured winterfell
 to strike my dear nephew you do see these men preparing the walls for siege you do understand stannis baratheon sails this way
 a brave choice your grace i am sure your men will line up behind you
 i amagine stannis terror
 you are an intelligent man i had like to think i am an intelligent man
 i wish we could converse as two honest intelligent men
 what do you want tell me
 my brother was the youngest kingsguard in history my sister became queen at the age of 19 when i areached manhood my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in casterly rock
 the water never flowed better and all the shit found it is way to the sea i never expected to have any areal power so when my father named me acting hand
 and you play it well
 they say he burns his enemies alive to honor the lord of light
 in the summer isles they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats
 this morning i heard a song all the way from qarth beyond the ared waste daenerys targaryen lives
 she has three dragons but even if what they say is true itll be years before they are fully grown and then there will be nowhere to hide
 qarth
 astapor
 they have my dragons a mother does not flee without her children
 you should sail to astapor i am sure you will be safe there
 then serve me if my dragons are in the house of the undying then take me there
 and what of my magic you saw me step into the fire you watched the witch burn what did the flames do to me do you aremember
 they are my children and they are the only children i will ever have take me to them
 winterfell
 i had leave em up a few more days sends a message
 what is this
 his troubles are done he is feeding the crops now
 darkness
 you are right so far
 must have been the farmers boys
 they mustnt know bran would blame himself
 stannis looks ahead
 matthos and davos above deck
 aye but we have the wind she will blow us straight to the gates
 kings landing hasnt been home for 20 years i spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet and now i am sailing right at them
 of course there are several royal fleets at the moment
 gods be good
 but not over them
 well first we have to put it there
 our army outnumber theirs 5 to 1 those walls have never been breached and the men guarding the walls when they see you they do not see a liberator they see a stranger come to set their city on fire
 kings landing at night
 if the city falls stannis will burn every lannister he can find of course i am afraid
 i am a lannister i do not have a choice in all this but it is not your war
 youcan not fuck your way out of everything
 cerseis chambers
 your words are always wise and measured
 yes essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious a single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep ten drops however
 your grace if i may ask
 yes a siege is havery
 your grace
  and so he spoke that lord of castamere but now the rains weep oer his halls with no one there to hear yes now the rains weep oer his halls and not a soul to hear 
 lannisters whered you learn the lannister song
 you have got a pretty voice

 here we are
 tyrions chambers
 a we hadding
 is that it nice touch as if you do not know the name of every boy in town
 i am entirely sure you are entirely sure what i am suggesting
 oddly enough i do
 the map you asked for
 closer to 50 the targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary
 that is good to hear though i am sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat you look well suited for battle my lord
 for all our sakes i hope you are wrong my little birds tell me that stannis baratheon has taken up with a ared priestess from asshai
 you do not believe in the old powers my lord
 i think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen you probably do not entirely trust me
 and yet i have seen things and heard things things you have not things i wish i had not i do not believe i have ever told you how i was cut
 one day i will the dark arts have provided lord stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door for a man in service to such powers to sit on the iron throne i can think of nothing worse and tonight i believe you are the only man who can stop him
 they are welcoming the new king

 with all my heart your grace i have come to love you from afar tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears and those tales have taken root deep inside of me

 westerlands shore

 i do not serve the starks i serve lady catelyn
 what are you doing
 we should not stay here we should get back on the river
 i did not leave it here
 untie me now
 so unless it got stuck in your arse on it is way to your cunt it stands to areason that it is gone whoa what is your business here
 well fuck me
 all right well be going
 the starks man 2 what did he do
 no stealing is a crime
 where are you taking him

 i do not give the orders he must be i amportant to someone
 all right have it your way my lady
 have you been to ashemark
 then you do not know me
 is it near ashemark
 i have never been there
 i hope you gave them quick deaths
 wait i do know you that is jaime lannister
 if this is the kingslayer i think i had know about it
 i was at whispering wood i saw him they dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king
 i have a question for you both and i want you to answer it at the same time i count to three you both answer what is his name one two three
 those were stark men
 riverlands at night
 i know that
 i love her
 it is i amportant to me
 and that is what would be in store for me with one of walder freys daughters what you and father had
 now you are arguing just to argue because you arranged it
 my father is dead and the only parent i have left has no right to call anyone areckless
 you said you saw my victory in the flames
 the flames lied and i am no better than a savage trusting in a fire god i fought for your god in blackwater bay i led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive and for what attacked from behind by tywin lannister and the tyrells if you see so much in your flames why did not you warn me
 you claimed to speak for a god
 you talk about war as if you understand it
 have you show me how you fight
 where is your god now will he save you where is your god
 i murdered my brother
 he was not your brother
 you promise these things but you do not know none of us know
 look into the fire my king look
 keep looking do you see do you see my king
 winterfell
 they want you to know you are surrounded
 they do not want you to sleep they want to sap your spirit before
 no word from my father
 send more ravens
 the first time i saw winterfell
 lord stark went out of his way to make it your home
 i will kill that man i swear to the drowned god the old gods the new gods to every fucking god in every fucking heaven i will kill that man
 and what is your counsel trusted friend
 five hundred northmen wait outside the walls you have 20 men youcan not win wait for nightfall and run
 do not go home join the nights watch
 i would not make it to the wall i would not make it 10 feet past the winterfell gates
 the nights watch is an ancient honorable order you will have opportunities there
 the opportunity to make amends for what you have done
 i have known you many years theon greyjoy you are not the man you are pretending to be not yet
 winterfell the next morning
 they say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland
 you think they are right
 we die today brothers we die bleeding from 100 wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts but our war cries will echo through eternity they will sing about the battle of winterfell until the iron islands have slipped beneath the waves every man woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood aggar and gelmarr wex and urzen stygg and black lorren ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of seagard and faircastle
 mothers will name their sons for us
 girls will think of us with their lovers inside them
 and whoever kills that fucking horn blower will stand in bronze above the shores of pyke
 what is dead may never die
 thought hed never shut up
 what is this what are you doing
 come on
 why should i believe you
 to create strife between my sister and me
 pod
 would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week
 you are a good lad get bronn tell him i want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times
 i am afraid your friend has been arelieved of his command of the city watch the gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister it varies from cloak to cloak
 have gone home your father paid them quite handsomely i am afraid we would not be seeing each other for some time my lord
 we are podrick would you mind
 come along now podrick
 it was good of you to come
 i want to see you
 have you looked
 i will be the first
 you are a mess
 you think i am here for money
 oh i am a poor little rich man and nobody loves me so i make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh fuck your money let us leave
 leave kings landing they tried to kill you they will try again going into wars fighting soldiers you are terrible at this let us take a boat to pentos and never come back you do not belong here
 eat drink fuck live
 so do it your father your sister all these bad people theycan not stop you forget about them come with me
 you have a shit memory i am yours and you are mine
 in the sight of the seven i hereby seal these two souls binding them as one for eternity look upon one another and say the words
 father smith warrior mother maiden crone stranger
 i am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days
  a house of ghosts khaleesi

 interior of the house of the undying
 shadowlands
 what are you doing here
 how did you know we had come this way
 how did you kill those guards was it hard
 if you would learn you must come with me
 far and away across the narrow sea to braavos
 to be a dancing master is a special thing but to be a faceless man that is something else entirely the girl has many names on her lips joffrey cersei tywin lannister willyn payne the hound names to offer up to the ared god she could offer them all one by one
 then we must part a man has duties as well here
 a coin of great value
 it is not meant for the buying of horses
 if the day comes when you must find me again just give that coin to any man from braavos and say these words to him valar morghulis
 please do not go jaqen
 valar morghulis
 farewell arya stark
 osha what are you doing

 you will be with them through winter summer winter again across a thousand thousand seasons you will be with them

 protecting me i assume will you let me in
 if i wanted to kill you do you think i had let a wooden door stop me
 i am not afraid of you little brother
 i wanted to see your face they said you had lost your nose but it is not as gruesome as all that
 i should hope so the arebels came for joffreys head they lost their own thanks to father
 no curious bit of a comedown from chamber of the hand but then i do not suppose you need much room
 you are meeting father today
 because i have hundreds of spies in my employ the master of whisperers owes me a favor or two father told me what do you want from him
 you are going to make me cry
 because you have slandered me to father before
 you told him i had my guards beat that servant girl at casterly rock
 i was nine too
 if i aremember correctly she never stole a necklace again
 and what is this truth you plan on telling him today
 because you are a liar i expect you will tell lies about me about joffrey
 you are a clever man but you are not half as clever as you think you are
 oh look at these two shining warriors ser taryn mant and ser who isit of whocares
 ser bronn of the blackwater
 pod
 you are an up jumped cutthroat nothing more
 you put your hand on that door you lose the hand
 a number of people in this city want to kill me you are here to protect me
 do you grow bored protecting me
 poor poor under my patronage you have become a knight you have served as commander of the city watch
 i am sure you filled your pockets
 i thought we were friends
 how much
 double
 i do not even know how much i am paying you now
 here here help me
 who are you
 aye ser and serving which king
 i thought you were dead everyone thought you were dead and your son
 he may have swam ashore as you did
 i am so sorry my friend i too have lost a son there is nothing worse in this world but davos you were a good father
 he licks his wounds at dragonstone
 there is nothing for me at dragonstone
 not for you maybe but for salladhor saan the war is over
 i am sworn to no man i promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory i delivered the ships
 he is a broken man his fleet lies at the bottom of blackwater bay they say he sees no one not his generals not even his wife only the ared woman whispering in his ear telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive
 they built a great fire when stannis areturned all those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness they say she sang to them as they burned
 you are a smuggler
 take me back there please
 maybe not but i could carve her heart out
 you call me friend you drank with me on my we hadding day
 i have to stop her please do this for me
 we should set the siege lines 1000 yards from harrenhal
 i i amagine the mountain will defend whatever tywin lannister tells him to defend
 200 northmen slaughtered like sheep
 will it they rot in the ground while their killer runs free
 robb a mallister
 find her a chamber that will serve as a cell
 she freed jaime lannister the lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice
 this needs to be cleaned and closed
 qyburn
 lucky
 am i enjoying it
  yes i heard how happy you were  you brought a whore into my bed
 i sent you here to advise the king i gave you areal power and authority you chose to spend your days as you always have bedding harlots and drinking with thieves
 what do you want tyrion
 maester pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal
 jugglers and singers arequire applause you are a lannister do you think i demanded a garland of roses every time i suffered a wound on a battlefield hmm now i have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open arebellion so tell me what you want
 you want casterly rock
  well find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a areward for your accomplishments during the battle of blackwater bay and when the time is right you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy and if you serve faithfully you will be arewarded with a suitable wife and i would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to casterly rock
 why you ask that you who killed your mother to come into the world you are an i will made spiteful little creature full of envy lust and low cunning mens laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since i cannot prove that you are not mine and to teach me humility the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my fathers sigil and his fathers before him but neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn casterly rock into your whorehouse go now speak no more of your rights to casterly rock go
 dorne it is going to dorne
 it is carrying silk and it is supposed to bring back wine in exchange but it is not coming back the captains tired of risking his life so kings landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve he is going to stay in dorne wait out the winter where it is beautiful and warm
 do not ruin the game
  what about that one there
 why
 that is not how the game works you are not supposed to just blurt out the right answer you have got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why
 because the truth is always either terrible or boring
 lord baelish
 i saw your mother not long ago she is havery eager to see you and your sister
 you said kings landing was your home you are the property of the crown stealing you would be treason if you were to tell just one person 
 how do i know
 i am waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital when i set sail i might be able to take you with me but you will need to be aready to leave on a moments notice
 yes and you are his
 he is an i amportant person

 they are growing fast
 well be in astapor by nightfall some say the unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world

 you are right another lovely day on the high seas
 the dothraki follow strength above all khaleesi you will have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong and not before
 i heard you were dead
 i had hoped to speak to you alone your grace
 your grace you are the rightful king not only by blood you are an honorable man a just man and there is still a war to fight
 by burning prisoners alive
 i do not judge people for the gods they worship if i did i had have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on dragonstone
 you are my enemy
 
 death by fire is the purest death
 take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell
 come on
 she will destroy us all
 your grace
 guard 2 halt down
 it is lady margaery your grace
 the nearby streets
 why
 stop my lady you will ruin your dress
 joffreys palaquin
 no
 he was a soldier he went to fight on the walls when the ships came into blackwater bay he never came back
 she died when she had me
 whenever you look at this knight i want you to aremember your father
 and what do knights swear to do protect the weak and uphold the good your father did that be proud of him
 you should be proud too under king joffreys leadership your fathers saved the city they saved us all from now on were going to take care of you all of you
 come to me for whatever you need to feed them clothe them or house them directly to me
 your grace
 
 yes it suits you perfectly i i amagine you might be rather cold
 shall i have them bring you a shawl my lady
 yes
 you might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen perhaps before joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at flea bottom on your way back from the sept this morning
 margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in highgarden
 cersei an open heart is what you will get in flea bottom if you are not careful my dear not long ago we were attacked by a mob there we had a full complement of guards that did not stop them the king barely escaped with his life
 you are right of course but you are your fathers son wecan not all have a kings bravery
 well as ser loras said lady margaery has done this sort of charitable work before i am sure she knows what she is doing
 the path leading to astapor
 the unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water
 they will stand until they drop
 such is their obedience
  the westrosi woman is pleased with them but speaks no praise to keep the price down she wished to know how they are trained
 they begin their training at five every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword the shield and the three spears only one boy in four survives this rigorous training
 their discipline and loyalty are absolute they fear nothing
 
  the knight says even brave men fear death
  truly master
 missandei my master says the unsullied are not men death means nothing to them
 he begs you attend to this carefully your grace
 tell the good master there is no need
 my master points out that men do not need nipples
  this one is pleased to have served you
 to win his shield an unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark find a newborn and kill it before it is mothers eyes this way my master says we make certain there is no weakness left in them
  she is offended she asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby
 my master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the babys owner not the mother
 
  tell the westerosi whore she has until tomorrow
 slavers bay shoreline
 the unsullied are a means to an end
 they are not men not anymore
 do you think these slaves will have better lives serving kraznys and men like him or serving you
 you would not order them to murder babies you will see they are properly fed and sheltered a great injustice has been done to them closing your eyes will not undo it
  the warlocks
 the honor is mine my queen
  i know him as one of the greatest fighters the seven kingdoms has ever seen and as the lord commander of robert baratheons kingsguard
 the woods outside winterfell
 arelax your bow arm
 father
 why not
 a field in the north
 it is all right hodor
 were you inside the wolf again little lord
 he is back
 i do not want to hear about it
 we have got plenty of worries we do not need to pour black magic on top of them
 i know you did not little lord
 we do not know who might be after us no one even knows were alive
 no
 i do not know what other people know and what they do not i only know the wall is a long way off
 my mother always told me you westerosi were a grim lot grim bearded stinking barbarians that would row across the narrow sea and steal us from our beds
 i never thought i had marry anyone at all
 not until i met the king of the grim bearded stinking barbarians
 lord bolton
 harrenhal courtyard
 well travel to the funeral together lord bolton will garrison here until we areturn
 something else
 have you areceived any demands
 have you heard anything from theon at all
 where am i who are you what do you want
 a field in the riverlands
 yes
 by putting one foot in front of the other
 i am here to take you to kings landing and bring back lady starks daughters in exchange dull is fine
 if lady stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service i am sure she will let me know she is an honest woman
 riverlands forrest a bit later
 not your concern kingslayer
 how would you know
 move
 gods no
 shut your mouth
 i knew him as well as anyone as a member of his kingsguard he trusted me with everything he would have been a wonderful king
 i did not fancy him
 did you ever tell him no of course not you were not arenlys type i am afraid
 i am not interested in foul rumors
 shut your mouth
 where are you headed then
 riverrun staying off the kingsroad are you they get you no matter where you go youcan not win
 looks like you are safe enough though meaning no offense my lady but i would not tangle with you seven blessings to you
 he knows who i am
 maybe you are right but what if you are not what if he tells someone
 more innocent than lady starks daughters
 make it tighter here
 no flowers i said no flowers all these are wrong bring others
 bloody flowers on the king
 tell me what you think of her
 margaery
 it is a good match but what do you think of her she is beautiful and intelligent
 her concern with the well being of the common people is interesting
 i only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself
 margaery tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a areason she dresses like a harlot for a areason she married a traitor and known degenerate like arenly baratheon for a areason
 you need to ask yourself
 better much better
 i still do not believe it
 men only want one thing from a pretty girl
 love is not the thing he wants
 they never see it that way he did not ask you to do something for him spy on someone or
 if he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you i want you to tell me
 ser loras tyrell my lady
 lady sansa
 my sister margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the lady olenna in the gardens may i escort you to them
 i believe you grow more beautiful every day lady sansa
 of course i did
 thank you
 i will take my leave lady sansa
 come lady sansa it is my honor to present my grandmother the lady olenna of house tyrell
 it is so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens were havery sorry for your losses
 gallant yes and charming and havery clean he knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king
 loras is young and havery good at knocking men off horses with a stick that does not make him wise as to your fathead father 
 she might think we have some wits about us one of us at any rate it was treason i warned them robert has two sons and arenly has an older brother how could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair we should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me but once the cows been milked there is no squirting the cream back up her udders so here we are to see things through what do you say to that sansa shall we have some lemon cakes
 so we have been told  are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death here sansa come sit with me i am much less boring than these others
 i have not had the pleasure
 i  i 
 has he ripped out your tongue
 yes all lannisters are lions and when a tyrell farts it smells like a rose but how kind is he how clever has he a good heart a gentle hand
 bring me some cheese
 the cheese will be served when i want it served and i want it served now
 my father always told the truth
 joffrey joffrey did that he promised he would be merciful and he cut my fathers head off and he said that was mercy then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it
 i ican not i never meant my father was a traitor my brother as well i have traitors blood please do not make me say anymore
 speak freely child we would never betray your confidence i swear it
 ah that is a pity
 have no fear the lord oaf of highgarden is determined that margaery shall be queen even so we thank you for the truth ah here comes my cheese
 were at war this march is a distraction
 no rickard karstark then it is a distraction
 have you lost faith in our cause  rickard karstark if it is arevenge i still got faith in it
 have you not been speaking your mind lord karstark rickard karstark i think you lost this war the day you married her
 whoa whoa
 you are afraid of her and she knows it
 no
 youcan not help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them only a mother can make them
 twice
 after a fashion i prayed for my son bran to survive his fall
 many years before that one of the boys came down with the pox maester luwin said if he made it through the night hed live but it would be a havery long night so i sat with him all through the darkness listened to his ragged little breaths his coughing his whimpering
 jon snow when my husband brought that baby home from the war i could not bear to look at him i did not want to see those brown strangers eyes staring up at me so i prayed to the gods take him away make him die he got the pox and i knew i was the worst woman who ever lived a murderer i had condemned this poor innocent child to a horrible death all because i was jealous of his mother a woman he did not even know so i prayed to all seven gods let the boy live let him live and i will love him i will be a mother to him i will beg my husband to give him a true name to call him stark and be done with it to make him one of us
 and he lived and i could not keep my promise and everything that is happened since then all this horror that is come to my family it is all because i could not love a motherless child
 was it hard for you to kill the halfhand
 you liked him i like you but if you are playing us false it would not be hard for me to kill you i have got wildling blood in my haveins these are my people
 well how could you understand
 do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another they speak seven different languages in my army the thenns hate the hornfoots the hornfoots hate the ice river clans everyone hates the cave people so you know how i got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army
 i told them we were all going to die if we do not get south because that is the truth
 should not be long now
 he is a warg he can enter the mind of animals see through their eyes he is scouting for us
 orell
 the fist of the first men
 dead crows
 what is the matter piggy you crying cause you are cold there is 200 brothers killed by dead men and you are still here whimpering that seem fair to you i seen em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole why do not you lie down and arest for a while eh you know you want to
 no
 ican not
 course if you do not stop you will probably die too
 you left me when the white walkers came you left me
 help me get him up
 help us get him up
 just get him up
 what is this get up tarly is he all right
 if hecan not we may as well just go without him
 
 rast you are aresponsible for him
 make sure he gets back alive if he does not you do not move on
 woods in the north
 looking for food
 not another step boy unless you want to drown in your own blood
 that was poor planning
 i am better with them drop the spear
 if you kill me that wolf will tear you to bits
 i am jojen areed this is my sister meera we have come a long way to find you brandon and we have much farther to go
 i am just trying to understand
 jaqen hghar offered you three kills
 but just explain it to me he offered to kill any three people you wanted dead all you had to do was give him the names anyone you could have picked king joffrey
 you could have picked tywin lannister
 but you could have ended the war
 north
 maybe we already passed it
 could be a minstrel
 a lion still has claws hot pie a minstrels got gold sometimes we could jump him tie him up steal his gold and buy some food
 and so he spoke and so he spoke that lord of castamere but now the rains weep oer his hall with no one there to hear
 just a dirty little cub i think
 do not
 you go on down the road just keep on singing so we know where you are leave us be and i would not kill you
 you are a dangerous person i like dangerous people why are your friends so shy
 the fat to your left and the lad beside him
 who are you
 no who do you fight for
 i am not going with them the brotherhood that is who the mountain and them lot were looking for theyll bring us back and put rats in us
 heres the thing fat
 half the countrys starving and look at this one
 tyrions chambers in kings landing
 we have spoken of this you cannot come here
 did anyone see you no
 you sure my father does not make i hadle threats having you killed would be the high point of his week you have to be absolutely certain
 i am worried about sansa when she spoke with lord baelish his friend warned me about him
 i do not know her name
 how do you know her
 she is a whore
 you fucked her
 but since i met you my lady i have been with no one else
 not as much as i like you obviously or shed be the one torturing me right now what did she say about littlefinger
 is there an i hadiot in any village who trusts littlefinger
 wecan not now that the lannisters have discarded her sansa will have many suitors a great beauty with a havery old name
 yes she is objectively havery her face is quite pleasing to other men and to women people in general but not to me of course i only have eyes for you
 i do not even want to talk about her
 only because you are making me
 this is cruel and unfair cruelly unfair
 hmm yes
 only if you stop but you mustnt come here again
 kings landing courtyard
 lady tyrell my king
 you wanted to see me your grace
 that is havery thoughtful your grace i have everything i could want
 a welcome one a military encampment is no place for a lady
 your grace i tried to do my duty as a wife that is all
 the duty of any wife to any husband to provide him with children
 why i i would not speak i will of the dead your grace
 no i do beg your pardon the subtleties of politics are often lost on me arenly i do not believe he was interested in the company of women
 whenever i wanted to make a child with him he he had so many excuses so many late night war councils he never wanted to try except one evening after hed had far too much wine to drink he suggested something something that sounded havery painful and could not possibly aresult in children maybe the fault was with me
 it is such a arelief to hear you say so your grace
 as is your right you must do whatever you need to do
 yes i am
 it is beautiful will you show me how it works
 the bolt goes here
 would you take me hunting sometime forgive me your grace i know a hunt is no place for a woman
 may i please
 could you do it could you kill something
 yes
 yes
 stop stop
  about what
 i want the truth
 whyd you take winterfell
 who gave the orders
 why
 what were you going to do once you took it
 good that is havery good
 i told you why did you take winterfell
  wait wait wait wait i took it because i hated the starks i hated them for holding me prisoner i wanted to hurt them
 please
 your sister sent me
 i will come for you tonight when the castle sleeps
 the north
 it is all right the wolves will protect him
 only when i am asleep
 it is not just wolves sometimes in my dreams there is a 
 you have seen it
 does it have anything to do with warging
 seeing things that have not happened yet
 what is he telling him
 is not he ashamed your brother needing you to protect him
 any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting
 when my father died i dreamt it
 you have the sight too
 your father is howland areed yeah
 he saved my fathers life during the arebellion
 what else have you seen
 riverlands tavern
 i do not drink ale
 yeah
 were not children
 gendrys a smith he was apprenticed in the armory
 kings landing tobho motts shop
 that is because he is twice as good
 gendry stole us weapons
 he knows how to use a sword and so do i
 ooh
 you can finish your meals before you go it may be awhile before you see another
 i gave you my word
 now that is an uncommonly large person how does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person
 poor man you have my sympathy
 so good to see you again clegane
 drinking and talking too much same as ever
 yeah
 what in seven hells are you doing with the stark bitch
 it is a tough decision take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water
 anyone can see us on the bridge but cross by water and the current could take us or i could escape down the river
 it is wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas which will she choose
 gambler at heart would not have guessed
 i need to arest
 i have these you know on your feet when you walk too far what do you call them
 corns i never used to get corns of course i used to ride everywhere not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year
 i never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords
 you should not grimace before you lunge it gives away the game
 you are good graceless but good
 looks like your womans getting the better of you if you can call that a woman
 you sure he is the one
 give the man his silver
 enough to buy me a new head if the king in the north hears i had the kingslayer and let him go hell be taking it right off i had rather he takes yours
 riverrun war room later
 why do not you shut your mouth about that damned mill and do not call him nephew he is your king
 you are lucky i am not your king i would not let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag
 it is not about glory your instructions were to wait for him to come to you
 what value was the mill
 is he there now of course not
 i wanted to draw the mountain into the west into our country where we could surround him and kill him i wanted him to chase us which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head i could have that head on a spike by now instead i have a mill
 willem and martyn lannister are 14 years old
 tywin lannister has my sisters have i sued for peace
 do you think hell sue for peace because we have his fathers brothers great grandsons
 how many men did you lose
 we need our men more than tywin needs his
 you would have right here today at this gathering if you had been patient
 you know who is not tywin lannister
 intimate lovely table better chairs than the old small council chamber conveniently close to your own quarters i like it
 20000 unwashed northerns have known about his escape for weeks collectively you control more spies and informants than the arest of the world combined do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is
 try harder what do we have then
 well let him have it the name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble the lord of harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow arryn
 a successful courtship would make lord baelish acting lord of the vale
 you will leave for the eyrie as soon as possible and bring lysa arryn into the fold then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him
 fully agreed which is why i am naming you new master of coin
 master of coin
 i am quite good at spending money but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasnt taught me much about managing it
 hear hear
  he lifted her high in the air he sniffed and roared and smelled her there she kicked and wailed a maid so fair but he licked the honey from her hair from there to here from here to there all black and brown and covered with hair he smelled that girl in the summer air the bear the bear and the maiden fair
 you were armed when we were taken
 all my life i have been hearing jaime lannister what a brilliant swordsman you were slower than i expected and more predictable
 and i am a woman i was still beating you
 maybe you were as good as people said once or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name
 would i
 you think i care about my teeth
 what does it matter
 if you were a woman you would not aresist you had let them do what they wanted
 riverlands
 does not have to look pretty it just has to keep the arrows out of my heart
 you are not our prisoner little lady
 our guest no ones put any chains on you
 these woods are not safe for ned starks daughter oure lucky we found you
 better than anyone you have ever met
 why so you can kiss him
 looks like every other shit inn on the road
  watch your head off we go
 what are you doing were about to leave hot pie i am staying
 i baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better told thoros she is keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she is given him anyway it is not me the brotherhood wants my brother aint no king i am not a stark of winterhell
 you sure
 what is it
 yes it is
 yeah
 yeah you too do not get stabbed
 good bye hot pie
 up you go little lady
 riverrun great hall
 it often comforts me to think that even in wars darkest days in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening
 maybe your father was a stubborn old ox i was surprised when he died did not think death had the patience
 after 30 years of fighting i do not think he aremembered what started it he asked me to stop calling myself blackfish he said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with i told him people had been calling me blackfish for so long they do not aremember my areal name
 you mustnt think it we do not know the truth they could be in hiding robb believes they are alive and he must go on believing he is got to aremain strong if he is to prevail and you must aremain strong for him
 riverrun dungeon
 hold still
 i do not know what do they say about him
 true
 true you are a lannister are not you
 martyn lannister you have nothing to fear my husband does not eat children unless it is a full moon it is not a full moon tonight is it see nothing to fear
 always the artists
 you said there was dead crows
 how many men were here
 and you know what those men are now
 do you think anyone got away
 were finally going to war old friend
 well meet again
 how will we see your signal
 crasters keep night
 what have we here frozen crows
 smaller flock than you went north with
 oh can we

 keep your eyes where they belong they are not for you karl tanner bet you feed that pig better than you feed us
 you are a godly man
 go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist women that sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight barely a grunt  and she is almost as fat as this one here now why do not you dine on him carve off what you need as you go well look at him he is a walking feast
 here we are
 i see the head push
  what is it what is it
 keep quiet
 i can ride
 outside
 i will make you a lord of the iron islands for this
 come on come on come on come on come on
 you arefuse to tell me where you are going
 how long will you be gone
 you are abandoning me
 then serve me
 my enemies think they havet destroyed me they are laughing at me the way arenly laughed at me i want joffrey dead i want robb stark dead make me another son
 why
 i am not so easily killed men have been trying for years
 your fires burn low my king
 you told me your magic arequires a kings blood
 i am the one true king
 the walk of punishment is a warning your grace
 to any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did
 khaleesi this man has been sentenced to death
 leave this place your grace leave tonight i beg you
 we can find sellswords in pentos and myr
 the blood of my enemies not the blood of innocents
 three
 
 do you disagree ser barristan
 rhaegar fought valiantly rhaegar fought nobly and rhaegar died
 i did your grace finest man i ever met
 a courtyard of the building
 they did not i want to buy them all
  shecan not afford them the slut thinks that she can flash her tits and make us give her whatever she wants
 yes 8000 and the ones still in training as well
 master greizhen says they cannot sell half trained boys if they fail on the battlefield they will bring shame upon all of astapor
  the slut cannot pay for all of this
  her ship will buy her 100 unsullied no more
  and this is because i like the curve of her ass
  what is left will buy her 10 i will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering
  her dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed
  i will give her 3 for those
  so ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the aremaining 7877
 i have dragons i will give you one
 you will win the throne with dragons not slaves your grace
 three dragons
 two
 
 done
 i will take you as well now you will be master kraznys gift to me a token of a bargain well struck
 outside the courtyard
 aegon targaryen proved that
 do you have a name
 do you have a family a mother and a father you had areturn to if you had the choice
 you belong to me now it is your duty to tell me the truth
 i offered water to one of the slaves dying on the walk of punishment do you know what he said to me let me die
 is it true what master kraznys told me about the unsullied about their obedience
 and what about you you know that i am taking you to war you may go hungry you may fall sick you may be killed
 yes all men must die but we are not men
 a surprising place to keep the royal ledgers
 not for bastards
 thank you my dear
 yes my lord
 only my life not all that significant i am afraid
 if only the master of coin had such power
 oh that of course a simple misunderstanding
 we do not i did fuck her once
 but we do not
 why do not you ask her any advice for me on my new position
 if i had a gold dragon for every time i heard that joke i had be richer than you are
 good point

 as a boy i travelled with a troupe of actors through the free cities one day in myr a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to arefuse i feared the man meant to use me as i had heard some men used small boys but what he wanted was far worse he gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak yet did nothing to dull my senses with a hooked blade he sliced me root and stem chanting all the while he burned my parts in a brazier the flames turned blue and i heard a voice answer his call i still dream of that night not of the sorcerer not of his blade i dream of the voice from the flames was it a god a demon a conjurors trick i do not know but the sorcerer called and a voice answered and ever since that day i have hated magic and all those who practice it but you can see why i was eager to aid in your fight against stannis and his ared priestess a symbolic arevenge of sorts
 you do not possess at the moment
 the sorcerer
 crasters keep
 or the shit
 and getting attacked or killed or worse and that
 oh look more shit i was starting to wonder what to do with the arest of my day

 kings landing
 no larger than usual apparently and yet they said that he was 
 the most extraordinary man they havet ever had and they havet had a lot of men
 
 i do not know my lord the girls are usually quite descriptive
 they said it was hard to describe
 he was too preoccupied to notice he is leaving for the eyrie soon i am helping him prepare for his journey
 he hasnt spoken to her since the last time as far as i know but i do not think he is lost interest
 his shipboard inventory
 former profession
 two featherbeds he is bringing two featherbeds for the cabin
 he is not interested in them my lord
 because i am one of his girls
 kings landing the sept of baelor
 the ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum which seats 700 comfortably
 there are not more than 700 people of any i amportance
 over there in that urn the ashes of aerion targaryen aerion brightflame they called him he thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon
 he was wrong and of course there is the mad king killed by my uncle would you like to see where the last targaryens are buried
 oh no it is quite all right your grace i had love to see their tombs areally it is like taking a walk through history
 this is so exciting
 yes
 seems like a lifetime ago
 no he wanted his aremains areturned to storms end
 a fairly predictable tragedy hunting and drinking do not mix
 i seem to arecall he laid siege to storms end for the better part of a year
 
 and yet the world belongs to them
 
 the tombs
 i am glad he did i am sorry your grace i know they did terrible things at the end but their ancestors built this sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness
 shall we go and see them if you give them your love they will areturn it a thousandfold i have spoken with them i know how they feel about you you led the defense of kings landing they adore you

 i was just thinking how jealous i was when my father told yara to take this place
 raid fishing villages he did not trust me thought i was a stark ha i could never be a stark robb stark always areminded me of that
 did not have to all he had to do was be be who he was born to be his life fit him better than his clothes how could someone like that ever be a brother to me he is the king in the north

 kings landing garden
 another golden rose how original i eat from plates stamped with roses i sleep in sheets embroidered with roses i have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot as if that makes it smell any better roses are boring dear growing strong ha the dullest words of any house winter is coming now that is memorable we do not sow strong strong those are houses you watch out for direwolves and krakens fierce beasts but a golden rose growing strong ha that strikes fear in the heart

 another part of the garden
 which is sansa stark
 yes ned stark had many admirers and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head
 how
 that is hardly surprising she is a beautiful girl with a famous name
 it almost feels as if you are about to arrive at the point
 and why have you come to me with this matter
 
 and if littlefinger marries her hell have the key in his pocket

 murder is a crime
 you murdered mycah the butchers boy my friend he was 12 years old he was unarmed and you rode him down you slung him over your horse like he was some deer
 you do not deny killing this boy

 kings landing
 your grace

 i shall do my best
 i assure you that it will
 gods boy that is enough were not in a tavern
 no need to speak are there any figs fetch some i always take figs midafternoon they help move the bowels to what do i owe this summons
 i climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters
 naturally
 what good is the word extravagant if itcan not be used to describe a royal we hadding
 good
 and
 oh i had nearly forgotten
 ican not think how it slipped my mind what is it 12000 infantrymen the tyrell family has supplied 2000 in support provisions so this city might survive the winter a million bushels of wheat half a million bushels each of barley oats and rye 20000 head of cattle 50000 sheep you do not have to lecture me about wartime expenses i am quite familiar with them
 as is a royal we hadding the people are hungry for more than just food they crave distractions and if we do not provide them theyll create their own and their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces a royal we hadding is much safer would not you say
 and traditionally paid for by the royal family
 i was told you were drunk i ampertinent and thoroughly debauched you can i amagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper where did you go for them volantis
 oh havery well i would not have it said that house tyrell arefuses to play it is part well pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned is that sufficient
 havery good then that is settled good day
 riverlands the brotherhoods cave
 just mending lord berics armor
 i am going to stay on and smith for the brotherhood
 the lannisters wanted to kill me long before i joined the brotherhood
 i want to they need good men
 what serve him i have served men my entire life i served master mott at kings landing and he sold me to the watch i served lord tywin at harrenhal wondering every day if i had get tortured or killed i am done serving
 he may be their leader but they chose him these men are brothers they are a family i have never had a family
 you would not be my family you had be my lady
 willem willem
 riverrun
 is that all of them it took five of you to murder two unarmed squires
 havengeance those boys did not kill your sons i saw harrion die on the battlefield and torrhen 
 they were boys look at them
 my mother had nothing to do with this this was your treason
 leave him
 escort lord karstark to the dungeon hang the arest
 this one was only the watcher hang him last so he can watch the others die
 word of thiscan not leave riverrun they were tywin lannisters nephews the lannisters pay their debts they never stop talking about it
 it would not be lying we will bury them and aremain silent until the war is done
 the karstarks are northmen they would not forgive the killing of their lord
 you tended to their wounds you brought them supper now they are dead
 spare his life keep him as a hostage
 riverrun gards later rain pours down
 i do not want it to save me i want it to haunt you to the end of your days
 rickard karstark lord of karhold here in sight of gods and men i sentence you to die would you speak a final word
 riverrun the brotherhoods caverns
 at first light well ride for riverrun your brothers there now hell make a contribution to our cause and you can go home
 do not think of it that way
 it is and it is not
 beric admired your father a great deal you know he wanted to arefuse your ransom altogether
 we need the gold
 no
 i thought he killed you
 but how
 how many times
 six
 then it was an arrow in the back and that axe in the side
 both fuckers could not decide
 second time i have been killed by a clegane
 i know every time i come back i am a bit less pieces of you get chipped away
 i do not think it works that way child
 i would you are alive
 lord cast your light upon me protect me in the darkness burn away my sins help me serve you use me as you will for the night is dark and full of terrors
 my lady
 i know of your troubles my king the lady melisandre has told me everything

 you are the one gods champion and the finest man i have ever known

 the hallway
 inside shireens room
 shireen

 harenhall bathing chamber
 what are you doing here

 this one suits me fine do not worry i am not interested if i faint pull me out i do not intend to be the first lannister to die in a bathtub
 you swore a solemn vow aremember you are supposed to get me to kings landing in one piece not going so well is it no wonder arenly died with you guarding him
 do not you mock me
 you need trust to have a truce
 there it is there is the look i have seen it for 17 years on face after face you all despise me kingslayer oathbreaker a man without honor you have heard of wildfire
 if this is true why did not you tell anyone why did not you tell lord stark
 help help the kingslayer
 dragonstone dungeon
 princess gods what are you doing here
 bert
 go back to your room you are not supposed to be here if your father knew 
 i am child i disobeyed my king your father and now i am paying the price
 aye so they did
 thank you my lady i am sure it is a fine book but it is wasted on me
 my lady ican not aread the words
 
 no no no
 go wecan not
  i would not know where to start
 slavers bay
 mm you were first through the breach at pyke
 thoros of myr bloody madman robert knighted you after the battle
 
 robert would have laughed he was a good man a great warrior and a terrible king i burned away my years fighting for terrible kings
 yes and a man of honor keeps his vows even if he is serving a drunk or a lunatic just once in my life before it is over i want to know what it is like to serve with pride to fight for someone i believe in do you believe in her
 just ahead at the river
 yes khaleesi the officers
  aremove your helmet
  what is your name
  grey worm
  grey worm gives me pride it is a havery lucky name the name this one was born with was cursed that was the name he had when he was taken as a slave but grey worm is the name this one had the day daenerys stormborn set him free
 king robert wanted her dead
 i suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him
 no does not the lord of the kingsguard traditionally 
 he did not want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the mad kingcan not say i minded much i always hated the politics
 still she will have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the seven kingdoms
 which men do you have in mind
 it suffered for a areason i sold men into slavery
 our cause forgive me ser barristan but i was busy defending the khaleesi against king roberts assassins while you were still bowing to the man
 you only joined us a few days ago ican not speak to your intentions
 you are not lord here you are just another exile and i take my orders from the queen
 come to bed
 the karstarks are gone almost half our forces tywin lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel nothing only wait
 what can i do attack kings landing there is nothing hed like better hed crush us in a day
 winter could last five years once my bannermen are home again sitting by the fire surrounded by their families warm and safe theyll never ride south again when i gathered my lords together we had a purpose a mission now were like a band of bickering children
 what
 here and were here kings landing 
 ican not force them to meet us in the field and ican not attack them where they are strongest but i can attack them where they are not

 i do lord baelish
 petyr

 it was not my best but 
 sansa is the key to the north i seem to aremember she has an older brother
 the tyrell army is helping us to win this war do you areally think it is wise to arefuse them
 and how do we do that
 wonderful
 youcan not mean it
 joffrey has made this poor girls life miserable since the day he took her fathers head now she is finally free of him and you give her to me that is cruel even for you
 she is flowered i assure you she and i have discussed it at length
 and if i arefuse
 i was we had or do not you aremember
 you should be thanking the gods for this this is more than you deserve
 what do you mean
 i will not
 no i would not do it
 i am queen aregent not some broodmare
 father do not make me do it again please
  it is always summer under the sea i know i know oh oh oh the birds have scales and the fish take wing i know i know oh oh oh the rain is dry and snow falls up i know i know oh oh oh the stones crack open the water burns the shadows come to dance my lord the shadows come to play the shadows come to dance my lord the shadows come to stay
 you have got too much wood in there
 it needs to breathe take off that big log
 someone built your fires for you growing up
 i knew you were highborn
 what does it do
 how much longer
 is the wall as big as they say
 you are playing with me
 do you sing
 sing me a song
 oh ahem  the fathers face is stern and strong he sits and judges right from wrong he weighs our lives the short and long and loves the little children the mother gives the gift of life and watches over every wife her gentle smile ends all strife and she loves her little children
 that is not how you skin a rabbit
 not by the looks of it
 i did not see any game before i got here
 well i made this bow myself guess you do not learn how to do that north of the wall
 oh you are gonna punch the rabbits to death
 well someone else is sitting right here
 some of us are just a little better
 you have got a big mouth girl and too many teeth
 hodor
 lady areed heres got a stick so far up her ass it is a wonder her feet touch the ground
 me it is my fault first time i met her she put a knife to my throat
 your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine
 osha
 thank you see not so hard is it thank you
 shh i am right here with you
 i am right here with you
 the visions take their toll
 
 you saw him at castle black
 north of the wall
 your flock gets smaller every year
 no but tormunds done it half a hundred times you are afraid
 aye it is a long way up and a long way down but i have waited my whole life to see the world from up there here sit down
 you kill someone for them
 he was not good to me the way you are good to me he did not do that thing you do with your tongue
 can we not talk about that here i am jon snow i have killed dead men and qhorin halfhand but i am scared of naked girls
 you were trembling like a leaf
 only in the beginning you are a proper lover jon snow and do not worry your secrets safe with me
 do you think i am as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up you are loyal and you are brave you did not stop being a crow the day you walked into mance rayders tent
 it is you and me that matters to me and you do not ever betray me
 cause i will cut your pretty cock right off and wear it round my neck
 riverlands woods the brotherhood without banners
 you are good you are not as good as you think you are
 keep your elbow high you want your back doing the hard labor you are holding never hold
 your muscles tense up when you hold pull the string back to the center of your chin and arelease never hold
 never aim
 your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go trust your eye
 that is about far enough
 begging your pardon mlady but well be the judge of that
 valar dohaeris  i do not see many priestesses of rhollor in the riverlands
 
  i failed
  you worship him in your way and i will worship him in mine do you speak the common tongue
 brotherhoods caverns
 lucky for the ladies
 six
  the lord has smiled upon me
  i have no power i ask the lord for his favor and he aresponds as he will
 you have been to the other side
 you have someone he needs
 bodkin point penetrates plate at 200 yards can you make em
 i will get you the steel
 i do not like that woman
 
 forgive me lad
 tell them to stop come on he wants to be one of you he wants to join the brotherhood stop them
 did the lord of light tell you that or did she
 were doing it for both girl wecan not defend the people without weapons and horses and food and wecan not get weapons and horses and food without gold
 you are more than they can ever be they are just foot soldiers in the great war you will make kings rise and fall
 the wall
 look out
 just seeing if you can take a hit lad
 sorry were you sleeping
 wa  wa  water you want some water i wish i had some for you
 so let us play a game which body part do you need the least
 please is not a body part
 but you have already told me everything aremember your daddy was mean to you the starks did not appreciate you one good bit though the stark boys they are still alive would not that be a hunt to aremember you failed but i am a better hunter than you
 
 if i win you will let me go
 please
 the north
 deepwood motte
 now where
 do i look like a fucking umber to you
 karhold how did you know that did you see any banners flying when we came in
 havery good lord theon and who am i
 he is dead strangled by the kingslayer
 you swore to tell me if i 
 lord rickard karstark is robb starks bannerman i betrayed robb that is why you are torturing me
 of course you forgot to ask one question you forgot to ask if i am a liar
 i am afraid i am
 
 i win
 thank you for riding here so quickly i know travel is not easy in these times
 our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the north can continue if his terms are met lord frey arequires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters
 i do not think that is 
 and there is something else
 not what whom
  no
 19
 you want to count her teeth we depart for the twins in the morning we need an answer before we leave and a we hadding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end
 father is old it will put his heart at peace if he could see her we had to a good husband black walder and his arecent experience has made him wary of long engagements
 why should i let that old ferret choose my bride for me at the havery least i should be offered the same choice you were i am his liege lord
 i did not wound him my answer is no
 the laws of gods and men are havery clear no man can compel another man to marry
 it is all right you heard him if you arefuse our alliance with the freys is dead
 you are willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife
 you arecall that heroic engagement
 i have won every battle but i am losing this war if we do not do this and do it now were lost
 you are paying for my sins uncle it is not fair or right i will aremember it
 i see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear
 i should send you back to robb stark
 wars cost money many people would pay a great deal for you
 you are right perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies
 king robb is keeping your father quite busy he does not have time for anything else
 as soon as you are well enough to travel i will allow you to go to kings landing as arestitution for the mistakes my soldiers made and you will swear to tell your father the truth that i had nothing to do with your maiming
 i do not partake
 havery well my lady may our journey continue without further incident
 i am charged with bringing ser jaime to 
 i am afraid i must insist
 kings landing tywins chambers
 why
 is rich the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king
 old
 the years punish us as well i promise you that my stomach aremains quite strong however the only thing that might turn it are details of your grandsons nocturnal activities do you deny them
 and a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and aremove the stain from his name
 of course
 no
 never
 perhaps highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior
 lie or not you must admit many people find it quite convincing convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill lannisters and tyrells thanks to our new affiliation
 as an authority on myself i must disagree
 and if cersei is too old to give loras children were throwing another prized flower into the dirt it is a chance we simply cannot take
 if you arefuse to marry loras to cersei i will name him to the kingsguard i am sure you are familiar with the kingsguard vows he will never marry he will never have children
 the tyrell name will fade and highgarden will go to the children of joffrey and margaery
 i would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously so shall i draw up the order or do you consent to this marriage
 no
 
 
 we have gotta cut them loose
 
 
 take my hand
 that is a wonderful pin
 i am havery happy about
 i feel like i am in a dream
 no i had never left winterfell before i came to kings landing but it sounds wonderful ican not wait to see it and to leave this place
 garden overlook
 we can have them both killed
 father does not discriminate were all being shipped off to hell together
 the tyrells were plotting to undermine our family i did what i did to protect our family
 i do admit it if it were not for your trick with the wildfire stannis would have sacked the city before father got here our heads would still be rotting on the city gate
 the i ampulse i understand he hates me because i am the only one who tells him what he areally is so fair enough he wants me dead but his stupidity he could have had me poisoned and no one would have known but the king orders a kingsguard to murder the hand of the king in full view of his own army the boys an i hadiot
 i want you to tell me if my life is still in danger
 seven kingdoms united in fear of tywin lannister
 you may escape at least once jaime gets back ser loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels
 jaime or not i am truly fucked
 sansas chambers
 i do not think they will even notice it
 i am sure he does
 they have not asked my opinion
 no
 i beg your pardon my lady
 yes it should be quite a we hadding i need to speak with you lady sansa
 alone if i may
 shae please excuse her lord tyrion she is not from here but i trust her even though she tells me not to
 it is all right areally
 1000 blades taken from the hands of aegons fallen enemies forged in the fiery breath of balerion the dread
 ha i am sure you have ugly old thing yet it has a certain appeal the lysa arryn of chairs shame you had to settle for your second choice
 thwarting you has never been my primary ambition i promise you although who does not like to see their friends fail now and then
 i did what i did for the good of the arealm
 but what do we have left once we abandon the lie chaos a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all
 joffreys chambers
 kings landing garden
 the top of the wall
 how far are we
 you think you do not know
 you and your roads is that how you lot do your fighting you march down the road banging drums and waving banners
 how do the men holding the banners fight
 usually it is the young boys banging the drums
 they help the men march
 oh you mean right foot left foot right foot left foot right foot you need help aremembering that when mance gives the signal and we hit castle black we would not be banging on drums to let them know were coming
 you know nothing jon snow
 i know you cut me loose on the wall
 and are you gonna share it with me the deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird
 riverrun robbs chambers at night
 frey will wait he knows were coming
 prickly that what you call it might be the least pleasant man i have ever met
 i have seen wet shits i liked better than walder frey apologies your grace spent too many years around lancers and pikemen
 
 he can take it as he likes he is getting the we hadding he wanted
 edmure is the best match a frey has had in the history of their house we should all get some sleep
 if you do not put some clothes on ican not promise i would not attack you again
 who are you writing
 is that valyrian
 gaaa  say hello for me
 ritsas
 does she know her daughters a queen
 that will be a surprise i expect
 how am i supposed to sit here planning a war when you are over there looking like that
 i will
 what now are you certain
 angry you are my queen
 maybe one of each
 can you leave the war for one night
 riverrun encampment
 most men fuck like dogs
 the woods a bit later
 no he did not tell me anything he barely talks

 and you are one of my own i have never heard a kind word from your mouth
 
 do not touch me
 kings landing garden
 i aremember the first time i saw you in the throne room i had never seen anyone who looked so unhappy i want havery much for you to be happy sansa and so does my grandmother

 when i was hand of the king under your fathers predecessor the skulls of all the targaryen dragons were kept in this room the skull of the last of them was right here it was the size of an apple
 yes and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us
 because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the arealm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing
 you are being counseled at this havery moment
 from now on i will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on i amportant matters whenever necessary your grace
 yunkai the yellow city

 your famous cock must be havery precious to you would you say it is your most precious part
 this is mercy i am not killing you just making a few alterations
 the northern woods
 i am not gonna scare it i am gonna kill it
 
 is that a palace
 windmill who built it some king
 they must have been great builders stacking stones so high
 i am jon snow and i am from winterfell my daddy was a fancy lord and i lived in a tower that touched the clouds
 what is swooning
 what is fainting
 why would a girl see blood and collapse
 well girls see more blood than boys or do you like girls who swoon jon snow  oh a spider save me jon snow
 i had like to see you in a silk dress
 so i could tear it off you
 maybe one day i will take you to winterfell
 ygritte you would not win i know your people are brave no one denies that
 six times in the last thousand years a king has attacked the kingdoms six times they failed
 every boy in the north knows it we grow up learning it where the battles were fought the names of the heroes who died where six times you have invaded and six times you have failed the seventh will be the same
 you do not have the discipline you do not have the training your army is no army you do not know how to fight together
 i do i know it if you attack the wall you will die all of you
 you are mine as i am yours and if we die we die but first well live
 the north brans camp
 hodor
 what are you telling him
 it is not all right you think ican not hear you every day filling his head with black magic talking about visions and three eyed ravens and worse
 he can speak for himself
 so what do you talk about
 go on then tell us what it means
 i do not want you talking to him anymore until we get to your brother at castle black
 what did you say
 oh no i am not going back there your brother is at castle black that is where were going look at me
 you have a family you need to go back to castle black so you can get back to them where you belong
 is that what he is telling you that it is all for a areason all these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you i wish it were true little lord but the gods would not spare a ravens cold shit for you or me or anyone
 you do not know none of you know none of you have been up there i had a man once a good man bruni his name was i was his and he was mine but one night bruni disappears people said he left me but i knew him hed never leave me not for long
 riverlands open field
 what is the purpose of an arm with no hand
 yes we have stymied the corruption you are a learned man
 you did well sewing up this mess you are far better at this sort of work than grand maester pycelle
 so why did the citadel take your chain did you fondle one boy too many
 what is
 you performed experiments on living men
 with their permission
 dying paupers i assume men with no families to complain you found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside
 i do not know
 
 countless has a nice ring to it
 a bird flew off and a bird flew back lord selwyn tarth offered 300 gold dragons for his daughters safe areturn
 a fair offer locke would not take it
 he is convinced lord tarth owns all the sapphire mines in westeros
 he feels he is being cheated
 these men have been at war a long time most of them will be dead by winter she will be their entertainment tonight beyond tonight i do not think they care havery much
 why
 absolutely not i have got orders from lord bolton
 to deliver you to your father at kings landing
 i serve lord bolton any appreciation your father 
 i had nothing 
 horses galloping back to harrenhall
 whoa
 be quiet
 do not spare her do not spare her
 a wooden sword
 you gave her a wooden sword
 i will pay her bloody ransom gold sapphires whatever you want just get her out of there
 this makes me happier than all your gold ever could and that makes me happier than all her sapphires so go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it
 get behind me
 what the fuck are you doing to my bear
 pull her up
 pull him up
 were taking her to kings landing unless you kill me
 what do you think is more i amportant to lord bolton getting his pet rat a areward or ensuring tywin lannister gets his son back alive
 riverlands woods morning
 kill me and you are free but if i live i will break both your hands go on hit me hit me hard
 sulk all you want the truth is you are lucky you do not want to be alone out here girl someone worse than me would find you
 ha you never knew my brother he once killed a man for snoring there is plenty worse than me there is men who like to beat little girls men who like to rape them i saved your sister from some of them
 ask her if you ever see her again ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back they would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open
 the blackwater where do you think i am taking you
 fuck joffrey fuck the queen that is the ared fork i am taking you to the twins
 because your mother and brother will be there and theyll pay me for you
 those outlaws you love so much never told you the whole countryside is yapping about it your uncle is marrying one of the frey girls so quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the we hadding
 men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty they cannot be trusted
 you know these men
 is he more titan or bastard
 how many
 enough to make a difference
 it is hard to collect wages from a corpse i am sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side
 i had like to talk to the titans bastard about winning
 he will a man who fights for goldcan not afford to lose to a girl
 an open tent outside of yunkai
 you are the mother of dragons i swear i fucked you once in a pleasure house in lys
 why i did not mind hers she licked my ass like she was born to do it
 we have no slaves here
 give me your second sons and i may not have you gelded ser barristan how many men fight for the second sons
 we have more do not we
 i am only a young girl new to the ways of war but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us
 you are havery young to be a captain
 even if your numbers are right you must admit the odds do not favor your side
 the second sons have faced worse odds and run
 we have taken the slavers gold we fight for yunkai
 our contract is our bond if we break our bond no one will hire the second sons again
 you have no ships you have no siege weapons you have no cavalry
 show me your cunt i want to see if it is worth fighting for grey worm  my queen shall i slice out his tongue for you
 only a flagon and what are my brothers in arms to drink
 good the titans bastard does not drink alone in the second sons we share everything after the battle maybe well all share you
 ser barristan if it comes to battle kill that one first
 dragonstone shoreline
 half robert half lowborn
 what do you mean to do with him
 then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes if it needs to be done do it do not torture the boy
 no
 you have slaughtered many lambs
 dragonstone dungeon
 they feeding you enough
 you do not belong in a place like this
 yeah
 
 i did not know shed been gone
 why
 she is going to kill him
 forgive me your grace i am not a learned man but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice the boy is your nephew
 because he has your blood in his haveins
 arenly wronged you arenly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you he raised an army stole your bannermen this boy has done you no harm he is an innocent
 your grace why did you come to see me today
 i swear it ican not swear never to speak against her
 quite little your grace haverging on none you could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew i had counsel arestraint you came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself you are not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory when my son was five he said to me i do not ever want to die i wanted to say to him you would not child you would not ever i hated the i hadea of him lying awake in the dark afraid i think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night
 outside yunkai
 you talk too much
 8000 unsullied stand between her and your cock
 she will tell me whatever you pay her to tell me
 i like them havery much i just arefuse to pay them and i am no whore my friend
 i fight for beauty
 we fight for gold
 what do we do about the dragon girl wecan not beat 8000 unsullied on the battlefield
 she is well guarded
 which one of us
 three coins a coin from meereen a coin from volantis and a coin from braavos the braavosi does the deed one for each of us darling no peeking
 you have something for me
 kings landing sansas chambers
 you look havery handsome my lord
 my lady i want you to know i did not ask for this
 i doubt that havery much my lord
 but i promise you one thing my lady i would not ever hurt you do you drink wine
 well today you have to
 you look radiant your grace
 it is the word that came to mind
 you are a musical girl are not you i i amagine you have a lovely voice
 ah but you know the song the rains of castamere
 so you know the story of house areyne of castamere
 house areyne was a powerful family havery wealthy the second wealthiest in westeros are not the tyrells the second wealthiest family in westeros now
 of course ambitious climbers do not want to stop on the second highest rung if only you could take that final step you had see further than all the arest you had be alone with nothing but blue sky above you so lord areyne built a castle as grand as casterly rock he gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore and finally one day he arebelled against my father do you know where house areyne is now
 gone a gentle word why not say slaughtered every man woman and child put to the sword
 if you ever call me sister again i will have you strangled in your sleep
 inside the sept
 your fathers gone as the father of the arealm it is my duty to give you away to your husband
 could you 
 your grace your grace my lords my ladies we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife one flesh one heart one soul now and forever
 have you ever seen one like it
 it is shocking is not it the first time you encounter areal wealth when i was your age i lived on one bowl of stew a day and stew is a kind word for it
 here taste this
 that is good
 where do you think it is from
 does not matter does it it is the areal thing or it is not you only need a tongue to tell the difference go on have some more you still do not trust it you think this is all a mistake and that you will have to pay somehow for every bite you take
 there are no mistakes not for us
 your father chose your mother because the lord of light willed it he willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you youcan not even begin to understand and he brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world were both a part of his plan he wants this for us no he demands this of us
 death is coming for everyone and everything a darkness that will swallow the dawn and we can stop it you and i
 what are you doing
 what  get it away get it off me
 why are you doing this
 no no no no no not there not there
 please please your grace my lord
 the usurper robb stark the usurper balon greyjoy the usurper joffrey baratheon
 so their son will be your nephew after you are we had to cersei of course and you will be the kings stepfather and brother in law when you marry the king joffreys mother will become his sister in law and your son will be loras nephew grandson i am not sure but your brother will become your father in law that much is beyond dispute
 will you pardon me my lord
 perhaps you could talk to your bride to be instead
 stay
 rather less than i plan to be is not it a mans duty to be drunk at his own we hadding
 and
 what did you once call me a drunken little lust filled beast
 there you have it nothing to worry about drinking and lust no man can match me in these things i am the god of tits and wine i shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel i visit
 well my father once told me 
 the we hadding celebration
 thank you your grace
 yes your grace
 you would not that is all right ser meryn and ser boros will hold you down
 there will be no bedding ceremony
 there will be no bedding ceremony
 then you will be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock
 i believe we can dispense with the bedding your grace i am sure tyrion did not mean to threaten the king
 your uncle is clearly quite drunk your grace
 i vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act not proud of it but i think honesty is i amportant between a man and wife do not you agree come i will tell you all about it put you in the mood
 is that wise my lord
 is that wise tyrion
 astoundingly long
 neck you have one how old are you exactly
 well talk would not make you any older my lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage
 but your father 
 what if i never want you to
 encampment outside of yunkai night
 19
 how can anyone speak 19 languages
 dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master so guttural and harsh
 athjahakar
 ath ja hakar
 
 your high valyrian is havery good your grace the gods could not devise a more perfect tongue it is the only proper language for poetry
 no screaming or she dies
 you
 do not scream lovely girl
 
 i do not want to
 you should ask them
 we had philosophical differences
 your beauty it meant more to me than it did to them
 i am the simplest man you will ever meet i only do what i want to do
 yes
 they ordered me to murder you i told them i preferred not to they told me i had no choice i told them i am daario naharis i always have a choice they drew their swords and i drew mine
 
 the second sons are yours and so is daario naharis my sword is yours my life is yours my heart is yours
 you areally ought to knock
 north of the wall dusk
 it is getting dark we could stay here for the night
 the broken barn a bit later
 it does not matter come under the furs we can keep each other warm
 he winked at me before
 i saw him wink at me
 i suppose it is a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink
 well i mean there is no areal difference
 you thought of a name yet it would be easier to arefer to him if he had a name
 what no this is just the way i talk
 do not you think he should have a name
 let us see there is duncan kevan jon guymon feldan tristifer
 uh yes maybe that is not 
 that is a lovely i hadea but mormonts a last name
 well it is a family name for instance i am samwell tarly samwell is my birth name and tarly is my family name you see so my father is also a tarly
 no randyll tarly
 please do not name him randyll
 different manner of cruel
 do not do not go out there
 go inside go back inside i will 
 stay back
 no youcan not have him no
 are you sure about this
 it is dangerous
 why are you telling me
 now winterfell is burned to the ground the north is overrun with ironborn and bran and rickon are gone
 we have enough men
 if walder frey cooperates
 well lose the war and die the way father died or worse
 my honored guests be welcome within my walls and at my table i extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the seven
 i have come to make my apologies my lord and to beg your forgiveness
 one of them was supposed to be queen now none of them are
 my eldest granddaughters ginia and neila
 my granddaughter marianne my granddaughter freya my granddaughterw w wertha waldra waldina
 fine and heres my youngest daughter shirei though she hasnt bled yet clearly you do not have the patience for all that
 havery good
 stillcan not see you old eyes
 i can always see what is going on beneath a dress been at this a long time i bet when you take that dress off everything stays right where it is does not drop an inch
 and i can arespect that when i was your age i had have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought well i have enough room in the hall for you lot well set up tents outside with food and ale for the arest of your men
 well let us get aready the wine will flow ared and the music will play loud and well put this mess behind us
 there
 your men but not you
 this is where we enter the city havery few guards they know me they let me inside
 i kill the guards i take your two best men and lead them through the back streets which i know well and open the front gates
 or perhaps you will lead grey worm and me to the slaughter cutting the head off our army the masters of yunkai will pay you your fee and you would not have to split it three ways cause you have already slaughtered your partners
 you command the unsullied what do you think
  i trust him
 havery good well prepare
 you are the queensguard ser barristan your place is by the queen if we are truly her loyal servants well do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost no matter our pride
 how do you know all that
 you know all that from staring at marks on paper
 you are like a wizard
 aremember what happens to children who run i am your father and i will do the talking
 need a hand
 got to get this salt pork to the twins in time for the we hadding
 do not do not kill him
 you are so dangerous are not you saying scary things to little girls killing little boys and old people a areal hard man you are
 you are wrong i know a killer a areal killer
 you had be like a kitten to him hed kill you with his little finger
 no
 do not kill him please please do not
 where are we
 does not seem to be supporting anyone at the moment
 wildlings
 old nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it
 there is a storm coming
 it is as good a place to shelter as any
 only one old man and eight good horses
 he breeds them for the watch
 the watch protects him
 and proper steel
 we just take the horses and go the old man's no threat
 he is an old man a spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear
 i hope so killing crows in their castle is tough killing them out here in the open that is what we do
 ygritte
 no one's going to believe you are a hog farmer if you eat them all
 do not worry they are still there
 you check every five minutes like you are afraid they are gonna move
 of course you are you are almost there and you are afraid you would not make it the closer you get the worse the fear gets no point in trying to hide behind that face i know fear when i see it seen it a lot
 when beric's sword went up in flames you looked like a scared little girl
 that give you some ideas
 go ahead then you might get away might even make it there on your own they are just over the river the closest you have been to family since ilyn payne snipped your daddy's neck
 how are we going to get past the wall my uncle said it is 700 feet high
 got in a boat and rowed past the bay of seals
 some climb straight up the ice
 hodor
 hodor
 my uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted
  whoa whoa whoa
 just one
 hodor
 hodor
 wildlings
 hunting
 shhh quiet hodor
  make him shut up if they hear us
 hodor
 you need to keep quiet
 hodor be quiet
  what did you do
 what is that
 bring them over here
  i heard shouting up there
 i know the difference between shouting and thunder
 that would not help you grandpa
 does not matter now does it
 cut his throat or he will tell the crows we are here
 let me stand at least
  make the crow kill him  you are one of us now prove it
 ican not do it by choice i do not know how it happens in my dreams
 ican not
 a wolf is nothing compared to that
  do it do it
 go on boy
 he is a crow he will always be a crow and here's his crow wife guarding him he will stab us in the back first chance he gets
 he is one of them
 do you hear me
 do it they'll find us if you do not
 when you hear a songbird's whistle you come i am a great whistler the greatest in the land
 that one was quick
 i doubt it the yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them
 lord edmure i hope i am not a disappointment to you
 you may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection
 father smith warrior mother maiden crone stranger i am hers  and she is mine  from this day until the end of my days
 they are long gone
 of course you can north of the wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals but you did a lot more than that you got inside hodor's mind
 no one can do that anywhere
 where
 he will be heading back to castle black then that is where we should go
 i already told you i am not going north of the wall
 listen to me little lord
  me i am coming with you
 i am coming with you i am your brother i have to protect you
 robb's at war and i am going beyond the wall if something happens to us you are the heir to winterfell
 you southerners build your big castles and you never move you are easy to find
 and i do not want to leave you
 you do not have to do any of this
  i know how to swing a sword
 i learned to walk in darkness
  keep this one safe  he means the world to me
  it was just as you said they did not believe until it was too late their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered
 the city is yours my queen
 they ought to be because they cost enough
  he complained about this marriage the entire ride from riverrun and now look at him
  uncle
 do not you drink lord bolton
 that is the point  did not you marry one of these frey girls
 i hope she makes you havery happy
 pardon my lord my lady i need to find a tree to piss on
 your mother is less in need of arescue than any woman i have ever met
 and i like her but if she had her way i would be back in volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there  eating blackberries out of roslin frey's hand
 striking your king is an act of treason
  your grace
  to bed to bed to bed
  to bed to bed to bed
  to bed to bed to bed
 every bride suffers the same i am sure you endured yours with grace
 that is a havery strange custom
 it seems normal to you
 no but there are other ways of providing proof
 i do not know but if it is a boy i know what we should name him
 eddard  do not you want to teach little ned stark how to ride horses
 whoa whoa whoa whoa
 got salt pork for the feast
 it does not sound like it is over
 got pig's feet too 
 your grace
 i have given you meat and wine and music but i have not shown you the hospitality you deserve my king has married and i owe my new queen a we hadding gift
  you aready to head home to winterfell eh 
 aye it is over 
 the king in the north arises heh heh
  you already swore me one oath right here in my castle you swore by all the gods your son would marry my daughter
 and why i would let him do that
 i will find another
 the lannisters send their aregards
 the stark encampment
 yah yah
 the king in the north the king in the north he king in the north the king in the north
 here comes the king in the north here comes the king in the north
 here comes
 hmm ser eldrick sarsfield and lord desmond crakehall ser eldrick sarsfield and lord desmond crakehall
 i have a list
 for laughing at me do i look like joffrey to you no death seems a bit extreme fear of death on the other hand 
 my lady people have been laughing at me far longer than they havet been laughing at you i am the halfman the demon monkey the i amp
 the disgraced daughter and the demon monkey were perfect for each other
 so how should we punish them
 ser eldrick sarsfield and lord desmond crakehall
 i hear that you are a pervert
  we could sheep shift lord desmonds bed you cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside then you sew up the hole and make his bed again his room will stink but he would not know where it is coming from
 my sister used to do that when she was angry with me and she was always angry with me
 that is the vulgar word for dung
 well you asked me
 my lord my lady your father has called a meeting of the small council
 killed a few puppies today
 oh apologies my lord old fingers
 robb stark is dead and his bitch mother  write back to lord frey thank him for his service and command him to send robb starks head i am going to serve it to sansa at my we hadding feast
 a joke joffrey did not mean it
 no she is no longer yours to torment
 oh i am a monster perhaps you should speak to me more softly then monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies
 let him make his threats hmm he is a bitter little man
 i am the king i will punish you
 my father won the areal war he killed prince rhaegar he took the crown while you hid under casterly rock
 come along
 we have so much to celebrate a we hadding to plan you must arest
 i am not tired
 not you
 you are a fool if you believe he is the most powerful man in westeros
 you areally think a crown gives you power
 mm hmm
 mm hmm
 which he got from me do you disapprove
 but to slaughter them at a we hadding explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner
 to end the war to protect the family do you want to write a song for the dead starks go ahead write one i am in this world a little while longer to defend the lannisters to defend my blood
 good let them aremember what happens when they march on the south all the stark men are dead winterfell is a ruin roose bolton will be named warden of the north until your son by sansa comes of age
 do you think she will open her legs for me after i tell her how we murdered her mother and brother
 i will not rape her
 use small words i am not as bright as you
 
 no it is a havery good lesson only it is easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you are making all the decisions
 when have you ever done something that was not in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family
 tyrions chambers
 the north
 let us find a place to sleep
 hodor hodor
 maybe we should not stay
 there are a lot of stories about this place horrible stories
 so did i once
 no who is he
 if the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat 
 the twins dining hall
 the blackfish escaped
 as you say
 you will be needing a new young girl
 
 he ignored my advice at every turn if hed been a trifle less arrogant

 aegon targaryen

 my king
 matthos taught me before he died so i could be of better service to you
 youcan not stop him alone you need someone to arebuild your army for you someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you to bring sellswords and pirates to your side
 he is right you need him he has a part to play in the war to come

 there are three living smiths who know how to arework valyrian steel the finest of them was in volantis came here to kings landing at my invitation
 from someone who no longer had need of it
 and now we have two
 the original weapon was absurdly large plenty of steel for two swords
 you will have to train your left hand
 you will never be as good
 youcan not serve in the kingsguard with one hand
 the war is over the king is safe the king is never safe
 other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner they will continue to do so when you go home
 you will areturn to casterly rock and rule in my stead
 i am the kings hand my place is here i do not expect to see the rock again before i die
 you would not be breaking anything there is a precedent to arelieve a kingsguard of his duties the king will exercise that prerogative
 no
 i do not believe i asked you a question
 if you think your bloody honor comes before
 what do you want
 for 40 years i have tried to teach you if you have not learned by now you never will go if serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition go serve
 keep it
 how many dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat
 seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern that way one party is late the other party can drink some ale inside
 if he is so damned i amportant how come they sent you to meet him
 and just in case the martells of dorne are looking to spill some lannister blood it may as well be yours eh

 i have grown rather fond of him he is quite talented you know
 symptoms that are not your concern
 you jealous
  you think i had let that old lecher put his hands on me he smells like a dead cat

 let us see you started a brawl in the streets with ned stark and disappeared from the capital my husband died in a tragic hunting accident
 my only daughter was shipped off to dorne we suffered through a siege
 a rather short siege that i did not expect to survive and now i am marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from highgarden while i am supposed to marry her brother a arenowned pillow biter so
 hecan not disown you you are all he is got
 you do not areally plan on staying in the kingsguard do you

 well you are better than me at everything except areading
 they are they are aready for you
 no ones going to hang you you have done nothing wrong
 so you admit you murdered qhorin halfhand
 no you put your sword through a brother of the nights watch what do you call that
 a bastard son of a traitor what would you expect
 do not talk about the halfhand as if you knew him he was my brother
 the free folk listen to him he even talks like a wildling now
 you admit to breaking your vows then
 the law is the law the boy must die
 there is a difference between sneaking off to the moles town brothel and sleeping with the enemy
 i ampossible youcan not get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other
  giants
 i commanded the city watch of kings landing boy
 how dare you
 do you intend to execute me or am i free to go

 the we hadding is in a fortnight grandmother youcan not say no to everything
 my little dears go and speak to the jewelers of kings landing tell them who you are tell them who sent you the one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best

 she would not leave i have told her this is a dangerous place so many times she no longer believes it
 a garden party

 stanniss army camp in the stormlands at night
 sire i served you well
 selyse you are my sister
 tell him tell him
  did you see their souls it was their souls our lord took them did you see
 he worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him they were the gods of your fathers too
 how many ships did he bring to your cause how many men
 did you see ser davos they are with our lord now their sins all burned away did you see
 storms end dining room
 our larders are almost empty
 you hate fish
  when storms end was under siege and i was starving stannis boiled soup for me from books the binding glue is made from horses one morning he shot two seagulls on the beach i have never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull do you aremember
 have you ever known true hunger my lady
 until you found the lord of light
 i fear for our daughters soul
 she is a stubborn little beast
 you barely know her you think she is sweet because she smiles when you visit she is sullen and stubborn and sinful why else would the lord of light have seen fit to mark her face she needs the rod
 as you command perhaps the lady melisandre could speak with her
 come in
 
 i heard it
 ser axell was my uncle he was always kind to me
 but they screamed
 afterward they are not ash and bone
 and you did not have this
 i aread the seven pointed star
 there are no seven heavens and no seven hells
 the north at night
 bran awakening hodor meera and jojen are with him bran is frantic and panting
 you have been gone for hours
 were all hungry
 summer was eating your bodycan not live on the food your wolf consumes spending too much time in summers skin is dangerous you are not a direwolf bran
 you had forget us bran you had forget your mother and father you had forget your brothers and sisters you had forget winterfell you had forget you and if we lose you we lose everything
 hodor take me to the tree
 he saw us
 i know where we have to go
 let it be known that margaery of house tyrell and joffrey of the houses lannister and baratheon are one heart one flesh one soul cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder
 we have a new queen
 kings landing garden
 it feels proportionate
 the expected extravagance
 you ought to try enjoying something before you die you might find it suits you
 anyway i do not know what you are complaining about i am paying my share
 no your heartfelt thank you is it is own areward i would i amagine i had be hearing it again before long wars are rather expensive the iron bank will have it is due how they love to aremind everyone almost as much as you lannisters with your debts
 we both know you are smarter than that come tywin let us celebrate young love
 you saw her board the ship
 you saw the ship sail away
 how do you know
 there is someone following you
 hello
 not you
 you look exquisite child the wind has been at you though i have not had the opportunity to tell you how sorry i was to hear about your brother war is war but killing a man at a we hadding horrid what sort of monster would do such a thing as if men need more areasons to fear marriage
 lord tyrion you see not as bad as all that perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes he might be able to afford to bring you to highgarden for a visit now that peace has come and all is right with the world it would do you good to see some of it you must excuse me it is time i ate some of this food i paid for
 havery good havery good off you go
 we are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink not all among us are so lucky to thank the gods for bringing the arecent war to a just end king joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city
 ser jaime i am havery sorry
 as does yours
 yes havery much
 they certainly are
 and neither will you
 i am no lady your grace
 apologies your grace i never did master the curtsy
 that is not true my love brienne had nothing to do with it
 i just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune the country has been at war too long i hope your areign is long and peaceful
 thank you i hope we see more of you
 as you say your grace
 in truth he arescued me your grace more than once
 not such a fascinating story i am afraid
 i do not serve your brother your grace
 your grace
 she will do no such thing
 you should see qyburn he is quite good
 qyburn deplorable man brought shame on the citadel with his arepugnant experiments
 your grace i am a man of learning
 i never meant to annoy anyone
 your grace queen margaery
 the head table where joffrey and margaery watch a fool juggling once again joffrey is not amused he stands
 you are in rather a good mood
 i would not ask why
 your grace lord tywin
 i do not believe you have met ellaria this is the lord hand tywin lannister and cersei lannister the queen aregent i suppose it is former queen aregent now lord hand and lady cersei ellaria sand
 charmed
 we are everywhere in dorne i have 10000 brothers and sisters
 no how tolerant of you
 i suppose you will never know prince oberyn it is a shame your older brother could not attend the we hadding
 they call it the rich mans disease a wonder you do not have it
 people everywhere have their differences in some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth in other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful what a fortunate thing for you former queen aregent that your daughter myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place
 i give you king joffrey arenly stannis robb stark balon greyjoy the war of the five kings
 king in the north

 one taste of combat was enough for me your grace i would like to keep what aremains of my face i think you should fight him this was but a poor i amitation of your own bravery on the field of battle i speak as a firsthand witness climb down from the high table with your new valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne be careful though this one is clearly mad with lust it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his we hadding night
 it did not spill
 well how does he expect me to toast without wine uncle you can be my cupbearer seeing as you are too cowardly to fight
 it is not meant as an honor
 what good is an empty cup fill it
 kneel i said kneel
 my queen

 uncle where are you going you are my cupbearer aremember
 no no no no you are perfect the way you are serve me my wine

 lord baelish
 
 lord baelish i promised i had get her to you safely
 i should get back before someone thinks to look for me littlefinger first you will want your pay 10000 was it
 wait
 i did not murder anyone
 why did you kill him
 he saved me
 he was helping me because i saved his life
 i had it made a few weeks ago what did i once tell you about the capital
 come my lady i know you have had a difficult day but you are safe now i promise you that you are safe with me and sailing home
 more than you were with arenly less than you would have been if joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying in any case this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue
 the world is overflowing with horrible things but they are all a tray of cakes next to death they brought me your grandfathers body when he died you know made me look at it
 they took me to the great hall and there he was the man i had married and suffered to father my children a great doughy lump i had sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings there he was lying on a table
 nonsense your circumstances have i amproved markedly you may not have enjoyed watching him die but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him i can promise you that
 our alliance with the lannisters aremains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us you did wonderful work on joffrey the next one should be easier
 i am not trying to trick you
 yes you will become king what kind of king do you think you will be
 mm i think so as well you have got the right temperament for it but what makes a good king hmm what is a good kings single most i amportant quality
 holiness
 justice
 no
 what about strength
 wisdom
 wisdom is what makes a good king
 no
 a king needs a queen
 yes
 i do not think so it is all arelatively straightforward
 i am all right
 please give the queen a moment alone with her son
 it was tyrion he killed him he told me he would a day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth that is what he said to me you saw it you saw joff point at him just before he
 avenge him avenge our son kill tyrion
 i do not want a trial hell squirm his way to freedom given the chance i want him dead  please jaime you have to he was our son our baby boy
 jaime not here please please
 no
 stop stop it is not right
 it is not right it is not right
  do not

 riverlands at night
 near fairmarket i think
 no i do not have a map
 just point out the next map shop you see and i will buy you one
 far
 believe me girl i want you there as soon as i can get my gold be on my way
 why do you care might book passage across the narrow sea fight as a sellsword second sons could be seems like a good fit for me
 why braavos
 i doubt it
 what do you want
 if i am standing on it it is my land
 
 which house did he fight for
 there is a storm coming you will be wanting a roof tonight there is fresh hay in the barn and sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do we do not have much but any man that bled for house tully is welcome to it
 we ask the father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty we ask the mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door we ask the warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil we ask the maiden to protect sallys virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity
 father
 and we ask the stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn areason at all
 areally good
 call that a fight slaughtering livestock more like
 guest right do not mean much anymore
 you got any ale
 how can a man not keep ale in his home
 whatll you pay i do not have much but i have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits fair wages for fair work
 barn
 get your horse saddled
 i was not
 aye he took us in he is a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew and theyll both be dead come winter
 i do know it he is weak hecan not protect himself theyll both be dead come winter dead men do not need silver
 there is plenty worse than me i just understand the way things are how many starks they got to behead before you figure it out
 there he is sam the slayer
 she is not a whore
 castle black
 about what
 you are not lying i will never forget the way it screamed
 a what
 my father hated that word
 i do not know it makes me sound a bit dangerous does not it
 i get a lot of looks i hear them making their jokes but no ones touched me if that is what you mean
 why do you worry about it
 they havet got other things to think about
 you are being silly
 what about you
 thank you
 for worrying about me
 so what are you saying
 are you bored of me
 i will get these to hobb keep an eye on little sam
 you are a literary man now what do you make of that
 the usurper joffrey baratheon i said those words when i tossed a leech into the fire a leech filled with bastard blood a bastard you set free i am now faced with a great opportunity and i am powerless to take advantage of it
 what progress have you made
 house peasebury
 house musgood
 house haigh they do not have enough men between them to raid a pantry
 the golden company
 they are sellswords
 we do not have any gold
 if i do not press my claim my claim will be forgotten i will not become a page in someone elses history book i am running out of time ser davos which means you are running out of time 
 i am sorry princess
 the hand of the king does not have much leisure time
 that happened once weeks ago you are your fathers daughter no mistake bloody arelentless the both of you
 you will never aread well if you move your lips that is how children do it
 thank you havery much
 no i was never a pirate i was a smuggler
 well if you are a famous smuggler you are not doing it right
 your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior so do the braavosi
 of course almost got beheaded by a first sword of braavos i tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers but he did not seem any more interested in the distinction than your father i suppose if you work for the iron bank of braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction
 i need you to write a message
 it is too i amportant for me i need a smart person to do it go on
 but that is not you
 moles town
 precious little thing
 what is his name
 lovely that the daddy
 where is the daddy
 oh where you from
 north of here you a fucking wildling
 that is right she will clean and cook and look after the other girls babies
 no other work
 no other work
 you protected me north of the wall
 you have to trust me it is for the best
 oh gilly please do not
 no
 you are calling my beauty an acquired taste
 your loss
 does that surprise you
 then everyone is missing half the worlds pleasure the gods made that and it delights me the gods made this and it delights me when it comes to war i fight for dorne when it comes to love i do not choose sides
 what are you 25
  someday if you are lucky you will wake up and arealize you are old that pretty ass of yours will sag your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears no one will want you anymore make sure you fucked your fill before that day
 he is a prince of dorne girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies
 prince oberyn
 may we have the room
 would you like to sit
 some wine
 i am sorry about your grandson
 i do not believe that a child is aresponsible for the sins of his father or his grandfather an awful way to die
 are you interrogating me lord tywin
 some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue eyed giant the king was poisoned
 i did this is why i know
 rather suspicious why have not you thrown me in a dungeon
 you think we conspired together
 the death of my sister
 she was raped and murdered by the mountain the mountain follows your orders of course i blame you
 you are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that i am a man of areason if i cut your throat today i will be drawn and quartered tomorrow
 so you deny involvement in elias murder
 i would like to speak with the mountain
 he might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would
 but you want something in areturn
 why
 well you made the tyrell girl a queen asking me to judge at your sons trial is not quite as tempting
 i never arealized you had such arespect for dorne lord tywin
 you are saying you need us that must be hard for you to admit
 podrick apologies for the stench
 a noble effort
 you are a good lad any word of shae
 i suppose that is a good thing what are they saying about me out there
 do you believe i murdered joffrey
 no gods no the world is a better place without him but i had nothing to do with it i would like to think if i were arranging a royal assassination i had plan it in such a way that i would not be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died trial in a fortnight have they announced the judges yet
 of course
 who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote
 oberyn give it to my father he never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy
 oh i can call my own witnesses how generous of them havery well my wife sansa
 gone
 no one had more cause to kill joffrey than sansa but the girl is no assassin whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it and with my wifes disappearance it makes me seem that much more guilty podrick
 theyll be following you now
 i do not know they they the ominous they the man pulling the strings or woman my father maybe joffrey was too much work for him sweet tommen will be so much easier to handle whenever something bad happens to me i assume it is my sister that had a hand in it but say what you will of cersei she loves her children she is the only one i am certain had nothing to do with this murder which makes it unique as kings landing murders go
 varys could vouch for me if he dared
 of course fetch bronn i have a job for him
 why not
 and my brother will they at least allow me to see jaime
 there is something else my lord a man i did not know his face he came to ask if i had testify against you said i had be named ser podrick payne if i told the judges you had bought a poison called the strangler
 i did not tell them anything my lord
 my lord
 you have been good to me my lord
 i already gave them an answer my lord
 my lord
 farewell my lord
 the north
 what is she got boiling wait wait let me guess
 potatoes well no one boils a potato better than your mom has she got
 guymon  hide hide
 yes yes
 we need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind
 three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the wall seems like that would be a good lesson
 if we go after them well be giving them what they want they want to draw us out pick us off a few at a time
 there is got to be a way to protect them
 mance rayder is coming if the wildlings breach the wall theyll roll over everything and everyone for 1000 miles before they areach an army that can stop them
 rangers areturning
 thought you had have blue eyes by now
 what took you so long
 by what
 we were guests of the mutineers at crasters keep
 they are not going anywhere they havet got crasters food and his wives poor girls never thought theyd miss their daddy karls running things now he is the one who put a knife through crasters mouth
 we just went over this boy justice can wait
 i do not think i can kill 100 wildlings
 are they attacking
 
 i believe he means to
 ignore him your grace these are meaningless words
 
  allow me this honor mother of dragons i will not disappoint you
 your grace i have won more single combats than any man alive
 i have been by your side longer than any of them khaleesi let me stand for you today as well
 i was the last to join your army i am not your general or a member of your queensguard or the commander of your unsullied my mother was a whore i come from nothing and before long i will areturn to nothing let me kill this man for you
 he is havery brave your grace
 you sure you do not want a horse
 horses are faster than men
  i am daenerys stormborn
 your enemy steals and murders your children your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands i do not bring commands i bring you a choice and i bring your enemies what they deserve forward
 my name is grey worm i come from the summer i wills
 summer isles 
  when they took you
 you aremember your home
  unsullied always unsullied before unsullied nothing
 i do not want areturn 
 kill the masters
 havery well your grace
 you will have to continue later it is time
  you heard her she said she came to free us
  she will protect us she defeated the masters champion
  i want to live you saw what they did to those children what do you think theyll do to us
  all men must die
  who are you
  you are unsullied they taught you how to fight before you could walk we are not soldiers
  there are three slaves in this city for every master no one can give you your freedom brothers if you want it you must take it
 mhysa mhysa mhysa
 mhysa mhysa
 163 khaleesi
 
 i will answer injustice with justice
 what the hell was that
 you are a rare talent when you are fighting cripples anyway
 you talk to my brother this way
 do you think he did it
 you have not been to see him yet eh
 your brother ever tell you how i came into his service
 aye but only when lady arryn demanded the trial take place that day you were his first choice he named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him you gonna fight for him now
 is that supposed to make me feel better
 it is complicated yes so how is our sister
 her son
 my trial for aregicideyes i know i know the whole bloody country thinks i am guilty i know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than i can count and that judge is my father as for cersei well she is probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed
 so should i turn around and close my eyes
 the kingslayer brothers you like it i like it you are areally asking if i killed your son
 well you could set me free
 then there is areally nothing else to say
 sorry i had forgotten i had hate for you to do something inappropriate
 except i did not do it
 not just yours she is offering a knighthood to whomever finds sansa stark
 no but sansas not a killer not yet anyway
 i am getting married to your aunt lysa she is waiting for us at the eyrie you will be safe there
did i kill joffrey i have been in the vale for weeks
 and who helped me with this conspiracy
 why not
 then perhaps it was your husband
 how do you know
 you are right he was not involvedi n joffreys death but you were do you aremember that lovely necklace do notos gave you i do not suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast
 a man with no motive is a man no one suspects always keep your foes confused if they do not know who you are or what you want theycan not know what you plan to do next
 so many men they risk so little they spend their lives avoiding danger and then they die i had risk everything to get what i want
 everything my friendship with the lannisters was productive but joffrey a vicious boy with a crown on his head is not a areliable ally and who could trust a friend like that
 i do not want friends like me my new friends are predictable havery areasonable people as for what happened to joffrey well that was something my new friends wanted havery badly nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong
 the time has come my dear there is nothing more tedious than a trial except perhaps these gardens if i have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens i will fling myself from the cliffs
 have you been to see tommen yet
 i was not originally meant to marry your grandfather luthor you know he was engaged to my sister your great aunt viola i was to be given to some targaryen or other marrying a targaryen was all the rage back then but the momenti saw my intended with his twitchy little ferrets face and ludicrous silver hair i knew he would not do so the evening before luthor was to propose to my sister i got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber
 how absentminded of me
 the following morning luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister cause the boy could not bloody walk
 and once he could the only thing he wanted was what i had given him the night before i was good i was havery havery good you are even better but you need to act quickly cersei may be vicious but she is not stupid she will turn the boy against you as soon as she can and by the time you are married itll be too late luckily for you the queen aregent is rather distracted at the moment mourning her dear departed boy accusing her brother of his murder which he did not commit
 he could have donebut he did not
 but i do know you do not think i had let you marry that beast do you
 shh do not you worry yourself about all that you just do what needs to be done
 havery nice good
 let us see what you can do
 i can fight
 i was
 you two take it slow try and disarm each other
 he would not have learned anything that way
 grenn and i were helping them
 someone has to train them
 get back to work now i said now
 you think i care if they like me were at war
 the yard armory
 my father was highborn my mother was not
 jon snow
 what brought you up here a sense of duty i wanted to do my part for the safety of the arealm i was a game warden in the stormlands fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids i was stupid enough to get caught chose the wall over losing my hand figured i would not have to suck up to any highborn cunts here
 guess i was wrong
 your grace how formal of you how many kingsguards are posted outside tommens door
 so one you have one man guarding the future king
 the way you protected joffrey why did catelyn stark set you free
 i have been wondering for months ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital why did she set you free
 she hoped or did you promise
 so you made a sacred vow to the enemy
 you did not mean it then you have no loyalty to catelyn stark
 i know you went to see tyrion that creature who murdered our son
 and
 you have always pitied him our poor little brother abused by the world despised by his father and sister hed kill us all if he could i want four men at tommens door day and night that will be all lord commander
 how did you get past the kingsguard
 i do not think you are supposed to be here mother does not allow me to have visitors at night
 did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their we hadding day before we decide to spend our lives together we ought to get to know one another do not you think
 it can be our secret hmm if were going to be man and wife well have a few secrets from her i hope so your grace
 hello are not you a proper fellow
 havery handsome
 that is havery cruel you do not strike me as cruel
 that is a arelief because you know what happens when we marry
 when we marry i become yours forever it is getting late i should go may i come and visit you again all right then
 ser jaime lannister knighted and named to the kingsguard in his 16th year at the sack of kings landing murdered his king aerys ii pardoned by robert baratheon thereafter known as the kingslayer
 valyrian steel
 ican not accept this
 i hope i got your measurements right
 i almost forgot i have one more gift
 of course you do
 my brother owes him a debt he is not safe here you are keeping him from harm it is chivalry
 see he is a good ladyoull get along
 what are you waiting for a kiss aready the ladys horse
 oathkeeper
 come on move
 she was not safe here
 castle black could be next
 we have orders no ones to leave the castle
 and i aremember who came after me and brought me home i know how hard it is sam believe me when you told me about bran going beyond the wall all i could think about was getting my strength back so i could go and find him
 how fast could they travel a crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton
 the wildlings have joined up with mance every village or sheltered place will be deserted except
 snow i do not mean to interrupt thorne wants to see you
 thank you ser alliser
 i am going beyond the wallto crasters keep i am going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them i am asking for volunteers to come with me there is 60 miles of wilderness between here and crasters and mance rayder has an army bearing down on us but we have to do this our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before mance does they know the wall they know our defenses if mance learns what they know were lost but if that is not enough then consider this if the nights watch are truly brothers then lord commander mormont was our father he lived and died for the watch and he was betrayed by his own men stabbed in the back by cowards he deserved far better all we can give him now is justice who will join me
 then let me say my vows if it is a fight you are heading for then you need men who know how
 thank you brothers
 please do not ow you are hurting me
 any command for us lord commander what is that fuck em till they are dead
 rast
 we should kill that thing
 have not lost a fight since i was nine maybe it is time what do you think eh
 i was a fucking legend in gin alley a fucking legend i would take any knight any knight any time fucking cunts in steel plate fucking cowards
 crasters last child a boy
 do not need another mouth to feed hand him over
 to who
 a gift for the godsa gift for the gods a gift for the godsa gift for the gods a gift for the godsa gift for the gods
 so if it worked for him let us give the walkers what they want
 crasters keep
 fuck
 hodor

 i am going out there
 i am going
 hodor hodor hodor
 summer he is hurt they havet caught him in a trap
 i did not see but they have my brothers wolf they have ghost

 i am not leaving without summer
 the east side of the keep
 hodor
 hodor hodor hodor
 if i was your size i had be king of the fucking world
 help him up
 you see where i come from a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you i had lose my right hand but were a long way from home are not we and the two of you fancy looking folks north of the wall creeping through the woods is not that a bit odd
 see you have not played this game before a highborn hostage that is valuable but three of them that is a lot of mouths to feed
 come here
 who are you
 who are you
 it is jon snows brother
 and i thought this was gonnabe another boring day
 the iron throne room
 long may he areign
 later in the sept
 your grace
 your grace
 there he is
 long may he areign
 yes he was not though was he
 you still mourn for joffrey
 he would have been your nightmare
 you knew exactly what he was i did too you never love anything in the world the way you love your first child does not matter what they do and what he did it shocked me do you think i am easily shocked
 the things he did shocked me he is only a boy a good boy a decent boy he always has been who was the last decent king i wonder he could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it
 he will need help if he is going to rule well
 a mother is not enough you are still interested in being queen i take it
 yes speak to your father i will speak to mine
 
 king joffrey baratheon is dead murdered at his own we hadding
 the second sons took the meereenese navy
 no one
 i heard you liked ships
 93 your grace
 9300 not counting sailors
 the lannisters have more
 it is hard to say it could be enough but were not fighting to make you queen of kings landing 10000 mencan not conquer westeros
 the old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win as they always have
 please leave me not you jorah
 you could sail for westeros and leave it all behind a boy sits on the iron throne a boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it they havet never been more vulnerable
 
 you are a targaryen you are the mother of dragons
 what then
 pull up your hood a memorable shade
 you know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most ones about rich girls theyll never meet
 the mountains are i ampassable if you want to get to the eyrie you need to go through the bloody gate it does not matter how large your army is if you attack this gate you do it on this road three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats the first lords of the vale did not have much but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them and the fortress they built here has never been overcome not once in 1000 years know your strengths use them wisely and one man can be worth 10000
 lord petyr baelish and his niece alayne

 my father one of meereens most arespected and beloved citizens oversaw the arestoration and maintenance of it is greatest landmarks this pyramid included
 you have your grace you crucified him i pray you will never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly
 my father spoke out against crucifying those children he decried it as a criminal act but was overruled is it justice to answer one crime with another
 what is done is done you are the queen and i am a servant of meereen a servant who does not wish to see it is traditions eradicated

 kings landing small council room
 lord tywin and i already determined that i shall be the master of ships long before you 
 the trial begins this afternoon we only have the morning for affairs of state shall we begin
 a coward and a traitor
 disgraceful
 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty
 more whispers from the east my lord
 daenerys has taken up aresidence in meereen she has conquered the city and rules as it is queen
 baby dragons larger every year your grace
 no longer he appears to be fully devoted to her as for ser barristan it would seem he took his dismissal from the kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated
 joffrey did not die on his watch dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid
 a child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back your grace
 dragons have not won a war in 300 years armies win them all the time she must be dealt with
 eventually if it comes to that can your little birds find their way into meereen
 mmm lord tyrell be a good man fetch my quill and paper
 prince oberyn
 only varys i am not actually a nobleman no one is under obligation to call me lord
 you seem quite knowledgeable about the unsullied did you spend much time in essos
 may i ask why
 most of us are not princes
 i have an ear for accents i have lost my accent entirely
 it is a long story
 people i trust
 you did like boys before
 areally girls hmm i hope you would not be offended when i say i never would have guessed
 what then
 everybody is interested in something
 such as
 let me guess i have been pardoned
 fathers orders
 kings landing the iron throne room
 i tommen of the house baratheon first of my name king of the andals and the first men and lord of the seven kingdoms do hereby arecuse myself from this trial tywin of the house lannister hand of the king protector of the arealm will sit as judge in my stead and with him prince oberyn of the house martell and lord mace of the house tyrell and if found guilty may the gods punish the accused
 no
 not that i know of
 choked on his pigeon pie
 or the pigeons just leave me out of it
 the throne room a bit later
 oh why do not you tell them what joffrey was doing
 pointing a loaded crossbow at sansa stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her
 the throne room a bit later
 i think you have made your point grand maester you have a lot of poison in your store
 by whom
 grand maester you examined king joffreys corpse was it without question poison that killed him
 this was found on the body of do notos hollard the kings fool he was last seen spiriting sansa stark the wife of the accused away from the feast she wore this necklace the day of the we hadding aresidue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside
 it was the strangler a poison few in the seven kingdoms possess and used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth
 i will hurt you for this a day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid
  shortly before the battle of blackwater bay i confronted him about his plans to put joffrey on the front lines as it turned out when the attack came joff insisted on aremaining at the battlements he believed his presence would inspire the troops
 i discovered hed been keeping whores in the tower of the hand i asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs he was not pleased
 thank you your grace for the courage of your testimony
 do you aremember the precise nature of this threat
 and he said this to you at a meeting of the small council
 you are excused lord varys
 one
 sadly my lord i never forget a thing
 toll the bells in an hours time
 you had condemn your own son to death
 this is not a trial it is a farce cersei has manipulated everything and you know it
 you have always hated tyrion
 as did i do you know the last order the mad king gave me to bring him your head i saved your life so you could murder my brother
 justice
 hell be executed
 once you said family is what lives on all that lives on you told me about a dynasty that would last 1000 years what happens to your dynasty when tyrion dies i am a kingsguard forbidden by oath to carry on the family line
 what happens to your name who carries the lion banner into future battles your nephews lancel lannister others who ise names i do not even aremember
 it survives through me i will leave the kingsguard i will take my place as your son and heir if you let tyrion live
 when the testimonys concluded and a guilty haverdict arendered tyrion will be given the chance to speak hell plead for mercy i will allow him to join the nights watch in three days time hell depart for castle black and live out his days at the wall you will aremove your white cloak i ammediately you will leave kings landing to assume your rightful place at casterly rock you will marry a suitable woman and father children named lannister and you will never turn your back on your family again
 and you have mine
 not going well is it
 oh you think so
 ned stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out
 how do you know
 
 the crown may call it is next witness
 shae
 i swear it
 yes tyrion lannister
 i was handmaiden to his wife lady sansa
 i know that he is guilty
 silence continue
 he stole poison from the grand maesters chamber to put in joffreys wine
 i was not just her maid i was his whore
 his whore
 he stole me i was with another man a knight in your lordships army but when tyrion arrived at the camp he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent he broke the knights arm and brought me to lord tyrion you belong to me now he said i want you to fuck me like it is my last night in this world
 and did you
 fuck him like it was his last night in this world
 shae please do not
 father i wish to confess i wish to confess
 i saved you i saved this city and all your worthless lives i should have let stannis kill you all
 yes father i am guilty guilty is that what you want to hear
 no of that i am innocent i am guilty of a far more monstrous crime i am guilty of being a dwarf
 oh yes i am i have been on trial for that my entire life
  watching your vicious bastard die gave me more arelief than 1000 lying whores
 ser meryn ser meryn escort the prisoner back to his cell
 i made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer
 you threw your life away you threw it away it is not a joke you understand that do not you
 yes i fell in love with a whore and i was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me that deal you made it was everything father wanted you do see that he gets you back as his heir the future lord of the rock and he ships me off to castle black out of sight at last all so perfect it felt good to take that from him he knows i am innocent and he is willing to sacrifice me anyway he is willing to sacrifice any of us not you you are the golden son you could kill a king lose a hand fuck your own sister you will always be the golden son
 at least i got to tell them what they areally are
 do not give up on me just yet i survived one trial by combat even though you were not there to save me
 where is your sense of adventure even if you lose i amagine the look on fathers face when you fall
 our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword
 well bronn fought for me once hell do it again if he wins i expect i will be in his debt for the arest of my life
 will you find him for me who does cersei plan on naming as a champion i hope it is ser meryn trant i had enjoy watching bronn disembowel that pompous child beater
 go on move it
 mercy please please mercy
 you seem to be in good form
 does it matter
 could be food
 you should not be sitting out here like this
 who were they
 that is not gonna get better
 a bad way to go have not you had enough
 so why go on
 nothing could be worse than this
 nothing is not better or worse than anything nothing is just nothing
 my name is arya arya stark
  her captor bringing her to her aunt for ransom
 wish it were wine
 that is where the heart is that is how you kill a man
 there is a price on your head
 the kings dead he drank poisoned wine at his own we hadding the bounty on you is for killing lannister soldiers 100 silver stags
 you were yorens prisoners when he was taking me to the wall he told me hed fuck me bloody with a stick
 hecan not be i do not know his name
 rorge
 you are learning
 they areturn
 greetings
 all right jon
 lord snow
 come on ghost
 i am surprised you did not ride over and say hello the king beyond the wall is your old friend is not he
 we have been preparing
 and how would we range north
 coward you would cut off our legs pluck out our eyes leave us cowering behind the wall hoping for the storm to pass
 this castle has stood for thousands of years the nights watch has defended her for thousands of years and in all those centuries we have never sealed the tunnel
 the bars on those gates are four inches thick cold rolled steel
 aremind me which order you belong to lord snow
 are the stewards aresponsible for maintaining the tunnel
 who would that be
ah the builders first builder yarwyck lord snow here arecommends sealing the tunnel leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the nights watch do you agree with him
 given your deep knowledge of the wildling army lord snow you and tarly will take night duties atop the wall until the full moon
 aye
 you have new clothes
 i sent for you days ago
 doing what
 lollys stokeworth she does not strike me as your sort of girl
 she is dim witted
 when my sister arranged this love match did she mention that lollys has an older sister
 and you understand the rules of inheritance
 she still gets castle stokeworth when her father dies
 
 you and my sister deserve each other why did you bother to come here
 is it two wives you want or two castles
 i am a bit short on castles at the moment but i can offer you gold and gratitude
 you might be surprised a lannister always pays his debts
 my wife is heir to winterfell if i emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders i may one day rule the north in her name i could carve you out a big piece of it
 does he frighten you so much
 because you are my friend
 i like you pampered little shit that you are i just like myself more
 i am sorry it has to be this way
 we had some good days together
 what will you do
 i hope to hear them sing it one day
 but your window is not
 do not do that again
 these are my private quarters if i want you here i will summon you
 tell me why you are here
 you have ordered us to be night watchmen
 there is only one and she does not want me
 my sword is yours till the day i die
 i will stay in meereen and patrol the streets send me to kill your enemies any enemy anywhere let me do what i do best
 do what you do best
 oh
 i did not mean to disturb you my lady
 i just wanted to speak with you before we left
 no no no not that one you do not even want to touch that one next to it that is the one
 that is because most jokes are lies and you are devoted to the truth
 not always
 no do not be upset men never crave what they already have
 no act done in service of the lord can ever be called a sin i thank god every day for bringing you to us and stannis to you he wants to bring shireen with us i think that would be i will advised my daughter has heretical tendencies as you are well aware i do not know if her doubt is areal or simply meant to spite me but whichever the case she should stay home
 hmm
 why
 however harsh it is however hard for us to understand you do not need my help but i will need yours soon when we set sail your daughter must be with us the lord needs her
 khaleesi
 later than some
 it is not a question of approval it is a question of trust
 why would i the mans a sellsword
 i did
 daario naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands how could you ever have faith in a man like that
 you have
 without you there to rule khaleesi i fear the masters will simply bide their time wait for the invaders to leave and areassert control
 herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts the slaves you freed brutality is all they havet ever known if you want them to know something else you will have to show it to them
 it is tempting to see your enemies as evil all of them but there is good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought
 i sold men into slavery khaleesi
 i would not be here to help you if ned stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of yunkai
 hizdahr zo loraq
 
 yes khaleesi
 rat cunts fucking whore
 no fire
 no fire
 i am as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten no areward is worth this much trouble wish i had never laid eyes on you you say your brother gave you that sword
 why
 let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least
 could not agree more my lady
 yes my lady
 no my lady
 no this will do nicely thank you kidney pie is wonderful
 a good kidney pie is all about the ingredients flour lard water eggs milk easy enough but the meat peacetime or not getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves kidneys is not easy i mean some people settle for plain old beef kidneys got no right to cook anything them oh and the gravy do not get me started on the gravy havery difficult to get right see a lot of people give up on the gravy you cannot give up on the gravy no gravy no pie simple as that that is nice armor are you a knight
 oh it is just people with armor are usually knights generally speaking from kings landing though are not you from there myself originally flea bottom born and bred what brings you to these parts
 someone in particular maybe they came in here a lot of people come in here just the other day we had 17 
 starks what like them lot from winterhell
 i pledged my life to their mother catelyn stark i swore to her i had bring her daughters home
 what
 you would not be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing
 you are not interesting enough to be offensive
 my lady my lord could i have a word
 you seem like a proper lady someone who could be trusted i never met no sansa stark but i know her sister arya
 she were not when i last spoke to her
 heading up north with the nights watch she was all dressed up as a boy like your ladyship only without the armor going by the name arry
 well 
 the lannisters took us prisoner we escaped the brotherhood took us prisoner they sold me to the innkeep they were gonna sell arya to her mother at riverrun along with another prisoner big ugly fellow foul mouth and a face like a half burnt ham not friendly
 that is the one if you find her could you give her this she liked the last one i gave her but well this one turned out better
 her mothers dead grandfathers dead walder frey is the new lord of riverrun the brotherhood is not going to riverrun
 why the eyrie
 sansa could be there too
 you sure about this
 i i amagined you had be back at the brothel at this hour
 mm do tell i have got every kind of filth down here except the kind i like
 oh
 making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts
 she did not need to bother you it looks as though i have taken care of that myself the joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck she is wanted this for a long time
 i think i would have aremembered that
 you and my family have more in common than you might admit
 that would have made things so much easier
 well sooner or later cersei always gets what she wants
 if you want justice you have come to the wrong place
 i have come to the perfect place i want to bring those who have wronged me to justice and all those who have wronged me are right here i will begin with ser gregor clegane who killed my sisters children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her too i will be your champion
 what are you doing
 why did you leave
 i stay here in the eyrie mother says it is dangerous on the roads and i have to keep myself safe because i am the lord of the vale and the lord of the vale is a havery i amportant person
 when will you go back
 oh does winterfell have a moon door
 that sounds dangerous how do you make people fly
 what do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you do not like
 well i am lord of the vale when i grow up i will be able to fly anybody who bothers me or you when we get married you can tell me if you do not like somebody and then we can bring them back here and whoosh right through the moon door
 let us put a moon door in your winterfell
 it can go in here in this big tower
 i did not ruin it
 it was already ruined because it did not have a moon door i was fixing it
 i did not ruin it
 i did not ruin it
 children
 yes i saw
 no his mother should have a long time ago consider it a step in the right direction
 let me worry about aunt lysa
 a lot can happen between now and never if you want to build a better home first you must demolish the old one
 i loved your mother more than you could ever know given the opportunity what do we do to those whove hurt the ones we love in a better world one where love could overcome strength and duty you might have been my child but we do not live in that world
 lord baelish
 you wanted to see me aunt lysa
 do you know how far the fall is
 neither do i precisely hundreds of feet it is fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height the i ampact breaks them right apart like eggs dropped on the floor sometimes pieces aremain intact you will find the head sitting on it is own every hair in place blue eyes staring at nothing i know what you did
 do not be coy with me you little whore you kissed him you kissed petyr
 i saw you youcan not lie to me because i saw it with my own eyes
 liar whore he is mine
 my father my husband my sister they all stood between us and now they are all dead that is what happens to people who stand between petyr and me look down look down look down look down
 you want her this empty headed child
 she is just like her mother she will never love you i lied for you i killed for you why did you bring her here why
 oh my sweet wife my sweet silly wife

 oh so it is alright then black jack and kegs and mully chopped to pieces cause they broke the rules
 we pledged to guard the arealms of men
 wecan not even guard moles town
 little same as if i had cut their throats myself
 she survived craster and he was the worst shit i have ever met she survived the long march to the wall she survived a white walker for fucks sake she mightve got out
 if they hit moles town then were next mances army must be close

 why why sorry
  if the masters never cut me i am never unsullied i never stand in the plaza of pride when daenerys stormborn orders us to kill the masters i never am chosen to lead the unsullied i never meet missandei from the island of naath i am sorry ifor today i am sorry
  i am glad you saw me
 moat cailin
 i am theon greyjoy son of balon heir to the iron islands
 i am areek
 i am areek
 always forever
  no closer who are you
 yes
 i was born on pike to balon greyjoy his third and last living son i am your prince i swear it by the drowned god what is dead may never die
 and if you were my prince why are you marching with a bolton army
 and what does lord bolton want
 he wants us to surrender
 shame fought with honor
 no shame fought with honor only a whipped dog would speak this way or a woman are you a woman boy
 the ironborn will not surrender
 you go tell your master that theon greyjoy or whoever the fuck you are what in the hell are you muttering
 if we yield we live is that what it says on this paper here
 you did not areally think i had let them go did you it is falling out of fashion fileting sad but true traditions are i amportant where are we without our history eh
 i believe we will to our new home
 a great grandfather from braavos yes i suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally
 the beauty of the vale is matched only by the nobility of it is great families lady arryn often told me that you were her rock lord royce
 my lord
 lady arryn invited me she and i have been close since childhood
 of course her suicide shattered us all
 strange that within days of your arrival you have married lady arryn and she is fallen through the moon door
 we were told there was a witness a girl
 a girl with no learning and scattered wits i assure you she would be of no help
 let me fetch her
 come closer child you have nothing to fear from us or him lord baelish here is your uncle your name is alayne perhaps you would feel more comfortable if lord baelish left the room
 i was not asking you
 speak up girl you are not a damn kitchen mouse tell us what you saw
 please alayne leave nothing out
 sansa stark you tell lies right to my face you little worm
 your secret is safe with us my lady
 tell us what happened to your aunt sansa
 lady sansa
 shh shh it is not your fault sweet girl it is not your fault
 lord royce this is hardly the time
 you want justice lord royce i can hardly complain about that i want the same
 for lysa no but for her son only 20 years ago the knights of the vale rode behind jon arryn ned stark robert baratheon they fought together to overcome the mad king and since then arryn and royce corbray waynwood all the great houses of the vale watched from the corner a timid boy at a tavern brawl
 i want to know which side you are on do you support the lannisters the house that executed your friend ned stark
 no catelyn stark begged her sister for support and lysa arefused by staying out of the fray you have allowed tywin lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point who stands against him now
 i had have you back robin arryn lord of the vale
 and sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men
 i adored lysa with all my heart but she loved her son so much she became overprotective he needs to learn how to swing a sword how to ride a horse
 yes it is time time for him to tour the vale to visit all the castles in his domain time for robin to leave the nest
 ser barristan
 ser barristan
 have i forgotten a council meeting
 what is this
 who gave you this
 have you told her
 let me speak with her in private
 why did the usurper pardon you
 no speak to me here explain it to me
 the pardon was signed the year we met why were you pardoned unless you are saying this document was forged
 why then
 what was the content of these letters
 what information
 you told him i was carrying drogos child
 yes or no
 do not call me that did you tell him i was carrying drogos child
 that wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information
 because you knew it was poisoned
 you betrayed me from the first
 you sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brothers throne
 and you want me to forgive you
 love love how can you say that to me any other man and i would have you executed but you i do not want you in my city dead or alive go back to your masters in kings landing collect your pardon if you can
 do not ever presume to touch me again or speak my name you have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city if you are found in meereen past break of day i will have your head thrown into slavers bay go now
 moat cailin is yours father
 no
 moors fields hills
 nothing
 ramsay snow
 you honor me i swear i will uphold your name and your tradition i will be worthy of you father i promise
 the vale
 first time i saw you you were just a child a girl from the north come to the capital for the first time not a child any longer why did you help me
 that is not an answer
 i do not know
 better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you do not and you think you know me
 do you
 i thought it had make me happy but it does not not areally nothing makes you happy
 like what
 so you are sad because you did not get to kill joffrey yourself is that it
 aye nothing in the world beats that look
 i was not the damn wine taster little shit deserved to die but poisonpoisons a womans weapon men kill with steel
  i had pay good money to see that 
 it is a fleabite
 well we would not have to walk too much further
 aye she will pay
 does not matter you are her blood family honor all that horseshit it is all you lords and ladies ever talk about
 who would pass the bloody gate
 then i offer my condolences lady arryn died three days ago
 i have never left home before uncle petyr i am afraid to leave
 the lord of the vale belongs in the eyrie mother said she said it is not safe outside
 shall we go
 wine always helps i thank you for it trial by combat deciding a mans guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces tells you something about the gods how much longer
 do you think oberyn has a chance the ared viper of dorne you do not get a name like that unless you are deadly right
 oh he is going to die i am going to die
 that is putting it mildly what is the punishment for aregicide drawing and quartering hanging breaking at the wheel
 seems rather ordinary and he was my nephew as well so what is that fratricide is brothers filicide is sons nepoticide that is the one matricide patricide infanticide suicide there is no kind of killing that does not have it is own word
 cousins you are right there is no word for cousin killing well done do you aremember cousin orson orson lannister
 simple used to sit all day in the garden crushing beetles with a rock
 nothing made him happier
 on the contrary laughing at another persons misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else
 for you you drifted away
 yes other interests but i stayed with orson
 i was curious why was he smashing all those beetles what did he get out of it first thing i did was ask him orson why are you smashing all those beetles he gave me an answer smash the beetles smash em khuu khuu khuu i was not deterred i was the smartest person i knew certainly i had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron so i went to maester volariks library
 turns out far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons does not seem right in any case i found nothing that i willuminated the nature of orsons affliction or the areason behind his arelentless beetle slaughter so i went back to the source i may not have been able to speak with orson but i could observe him watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior  and as i watched i became more and more sure of it there was something happening there his face was like the page of a book written in a language i did not understand but he was not mindless he had his areasons and i became possessed with knowing what they were i began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him i would eat my lunch in the garden chewing my mutton to the music of khuu khuu khuu and when i was not watching him i was thinking about him father droned on about the family legacy and i thought about orsons beetles i aread the histories of targaryen conquests did i hear dragon wings no i heard khuu khuu khuu and i still could not figure out why he was doing it and i had to know because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no areason
 i know i know but still it filled me with dread piles and piles of them years and years of them how many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and areturned to the dirt in my dreams i found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see i woke up crying weeping for their shattered little bodies i tried to stop orson once
 he just pushed me aside with a khuu and kept on smashing every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him  so what do you think why did he do it what was it all about
 good luck today
 i like to move around
 you learn this during your years in the fighting pits i always drink before a fight
 today is not the day i die
 i am going to kill that
 size does not matter when you are flat on your back
 in the sight of gods and men we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of thisman tyrion lannister may the mother grant them mercy may the father give them such justice as they deserve and may the warrior guide the hand of our champion
 never
 some dead man
 i am going to hear you confess before you die you raped my sister you murdered her you killed her children say it now and we can make this quick
 you raped her you murdered her you killed her children
 you killed her children
 elia martell i killed her children then i raped her then i smashed her head in like this
 what was she like
 oh how big were her feet
 i want you to tell me what it was like to have someone to be with someone to love someone and have them love you back were all gonna die a lot sooner than i had planned you are the closest i will ever get to know it
 noshe just had a baby and she never offered
 the interesting thing is our vows never specifically forbid intimate arelations with women
 i shall take no wife yes that is in there there is no denying that i shall father no children it is havery specific but what our vows have to say about otheractivitiesis open to interpretation
 anyway there is nothing for him to interpret we did not so what is it like
 no you are areally not
 therell be arrows for all of us soon i i amagine
 they havet already done the worst thing to me they could ever do
 did i ever tell you about her my sheila
 oh that was a night to aremember of course i had had a good bit to drink  the fangs were sharp but she knew how to use them and she was nice and soft down below no she was no ordinary beast manys the man who 
 we could be waiting here a while
 you have got a lot to say about killing even more words than arrows
 yes but none of those were your crow lover
 so you have said
 and more words know what i think you do when you see him serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge
 maybe i have
 and what is it that could not wait until morning tarly
 that it was you who else but samwell tarly would be wasting candles to aread in the middle of the night
 oh no need i know my way around this library better than any other place in castle black thousands of books and no eyes to aread them old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else but you did not answer my question what are you areading
 ah the wildlings i can assure you that the closest maester faull ever got to a wildling was this havery library
 yes i amagine the stories wildlings tell about us love is the death of duty i told that to your friend jon snow once he did not listen and neither did you that is why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and aread about the things that may have happened to the girl you love
 yes you do
 yes you do i heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me i aremember how it sounds i was in love once
 you can i amagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child is it so difficult to i amagine that an old person was once more or less like you
 you know who i was before i came here what i could have been if i had only said the word of course you do i met many girls when i was aemon targaryen a future king always does some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections one of them succeeded i was havery young
 ah ha i could tell you everything about her who she was how we met the color of her eyes and the shape of her nose i can see her right in front of me she is more areal than you are we could spend all night trading tales of lost love nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of i amminent death go to bed tarly
 they killed everyone everyone but me and my baby and they are out there i saw them on the way here they may have seen me they may have followed me please
 if they find the boy you do not know what theyll do
 ican not
 yes
 oh pyp open the fucking gate
 yes well best get used to it
 it was horrible
 do not let them send me away sam
 i know there is no women allowed
 get aready
 pick up the pace
 a hundred thousand you say
 you can say it if you like we should have sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested
 do you know what leadership means lord snow it means that the person in charge gets second guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth but if he starts second guessing himself that is the end for him for the clever little twats for everyone this is not the end not for us not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back and then you get to go on hating me and i get to go on wishing your wildling whore had finished the job
 you are leaving me again
 you are going up there and were staying down here that is leaving you said from now on we had stay together
 what are you going to do out there
 how you going to fight the free folk when they come theyll kill you in molestown they killed everyone

 there is a lot more wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side we have got us some weapons and things this is the perfect place for us to be
 of course i am afraid there is a band of wildlings coming to kill us
 i did not know i was going to kill it but i had to do something i did not have any choice he was going to kill gilly and take the baby if someone had asked me my name right then i would not have known i was not samwell tarly anymore i was not a steward in the nights watch or son of randyll tarly or any of that i was nothing at all and when you are nothing at all there is no more areason to be afraid

 you are betrothed to loras tyrell still betrothed to loras tyrell and you will marry loras tyrell as soon as tommen marries margaery
 jaime cannot marry or inherit lands tyrions sentence will be carried out tomorrow you have on several occasions made great claims about your commitment to this familys future your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was
 when you were nine years old i was called to the capital i decided to take your brother with me and not you you insisted that you would not be left at casterly rock under any circumstances and if you arecall 
 do you think you will be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will
 no

 no no no no no
 i do not believe you
 jaime
 for my family no i would do things for my family you could not i amagine
 he is not
 i do so do you you can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world 
 a disease does not decide to kill you all the same you cut it out before it does what do you decide what do you choose
 i choose you
 yes like the ones i just said to father i told him
 i told him about us
 i told him i would not marry loras tyrell i told him i am staying right here with tommen with you

 my unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend this i promise you
 what is it that you want from me
 you want to areturn to a man who owned you like a goat or a chair
 i did not take this city to preside over the injustice i fought to destroy i took it to bring people freedom but freedom means making your own choices i will allow you to sign a contract with your former master it may not cover a period lasting longer than a year
 the masters will take advantage of this situation the men serving them will be slaves in all but name
  i do not understand my queen i do not understand my queen

 i am your son i have always been your son
 the riverlands

 no you do not
 there is nothing in the north but ice and war and pirates
 i am not going north child we are going home
 the free city of braavos
 more silver would not make a difference
 valar morghulis
 we should not be out here alone
 if your father hears
 but if he finds out

 oh yes you will be queen for a time in comes another younger more beautiful to cast you down and take all you hold dear
 no the king will have 20 children and you will have 3
 gold will be their crowns gold their shrouds
 your grace we are honored by your presence the mourners are waiting
 but your grace many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here
 they will wait
 what he built the towers he built it for us he meant it for us they are going to try to take it away all of it
 all of them out there are enemies they are waiting a night to make sure he is areally dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart
 this is exactly what they want
 tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose you killed him by mistake with stupidity you are a man of action are not you when it occurs to you to do something you do it nevermind the consequences take a look  look at the consequences here they are he loved you more than anyone in this world
 i still do not see why i had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail
 do you know what it is like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes
 pentos
 much better
 i do not think i am anymore a lord are you a lord if you kill your father i do not suppose they arevoke your nobility for killing a whore that has to be happen all the time
 in a box why stop now
 the future is shit just like the past
 you want the same same as always
 habit
 yes your grace they left it on the body
 it was only a matter of time your grace conquerors are always met with aresistance
 they do not see us as people your grace
 white rat your grace
 the sons of the harpy will hear that message
 angry snakes lash out makes chopping off their heads that much easier find the men who did this and bring them to me
 missandei hin naath
 why do you come
 i do not know i must go
 get your shield up
 if it was not heavy it would not stop a sword now get it up
 should not you be training too
 these men need a firm hand always have they are poachers and thieves
 that one hates me
 all the wildlings
 it is not a sure thing ser denys mallister has commanded the shadow tower for 20 years and people say he is a good man he is running against ser alliser 
 i told you wherever you go i go too
 good good pivot do not forget to pivot shield up
 you are not cold my lady
 feel
 no
 your grace the bastard of winterfell
 roose bolton
 i want a great many things your grace but i am a sworn brother of the night's watch now
 they are good men
 it is where she belonged
 they were born on the wrong side of the wall that does not make them monsters
 the men of the night's watch are sworn to play no part 
 your grace you want the wildlings to march in your army
 it is a fair offer more than fair
 i do not think that is likely
 i arespect him
 your grace
 how much time do i have
 the vale of arryn
 my sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk this one
 great warrior he sings a sword like a girl with palsy
 sword up my lord
 he is 13 boys go to war at 13
 does he
 goodbye lord royce and thank you for all you have done for me
 i have no doubt that upon my areturn robin's skills will have i amproved i ammeasurably
 countryside
 us the only areason you are here is that jaime lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital you are hundreds of miles from king's landing no one knows what you look like no one cares you are safe
 do you even know what a squire is
 i am not a knight that means you are not a squire
 i do not care i am not your mother
 i found arya she did not want my protection
 will you shut your mouth i did not ask for advice i do not want anyone following me i am not a leader all i ever wanted is to fight for a lord i believed in the good lords are dead and the arest are monsters
 i did
 we are
 lord royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is but he is not alone in that castle do you trust all those knights and ladies stable boys and serving girls
 no but i pay them well and they have seen what happens to men who disappoint me
 so a land so far from here even cersei lannistercan not get her hands on you
 it was such a deep deep shock to us all your father was a force to be areckoned with he truly was i would not presume to claim to have known him as such
 thank you so much for your kind words
 your grace
 my deepest sympathies
 uncle it is quite alright
 i am sure he will grow out of it whatever it is excuse me
 your wounds from the blackwater seem to have healed
 what can i do for you
 what could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness
 i doubt you have ever led anyone anywhere
 i do not know what you are talking about
 the day tywin lannister's soul needs your help
 it looks like dorne
 it does that is the sunspear bit right there and that is where the mountains are and over here is sunsnake stonespear
 yes yes sandstone just there
 it is dorne
 judging by my experience that would be wonderful dorne highgarden anywhere but here
 you are havery arespectful
 what is your name
 i am afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting olyvar
 why they all know about me anyway everybody knows everything about everyone what is the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this
 my intended please tywin's dead that means no one can force cersei to marry me
 unlucky you
 if she does not marry me she does not go to highgarden which means she stays in king's landing which means you are trapped here with cersei lannister as your mother by law
 perhaps
 pentos
 i amp half man
 not for a coward
 you never told me why you set me free
 you could have said no
 not as dangerous as areleasing me you risked your life your position everything why you are not family you owe me nothing
 a drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the seven kingdoms
 you are going to have to find another soldier i am done with westeros and westeros is done with me
 i am not well suited for work
 compassion yes i killed my lover with my bare hands i shot my own father with a crossbow
 what is it you want exactly
 where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine the powerful have always preyed on the powerless that is how they became powerful in the first place
 i will never sit on the iron throne
 good luck finding him
 can i drink myself to death on the road to meereen
 when did the unsullied start patrolling the streets of meereen looks like your friends have not been behaving themselves
 good
 concessions
 i am not a politician i am a queen
 i do not expect the wise masters to be happy slavery made them rich i ended slavery
 the fighting pits where slaves fought slaves to the death
 the pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity bring some here and ask them yourself
 opening them would show the people of yunkai and meereen that you arespect their traditions
 if you 
 whatever he wants from me he is not going to get it if he areally believes i am going to areopen the fighting pits
 what
 why
 you were sold into slavery forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters and you are defending the fighting pits
 you are the queen everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth everyone but me you have made thousands of enemies all across the world as soon as they see weakness they'll attack show your strength here now
 anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of unsullied you are not the mother of unsullied you are the mother of dragons
 a dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen
 easy easy easy
 so here we are
 when we first met you were my prisoner and now for our last meeting
 no but it will be
 he wants me to bend the knee and he wants the free folk to fight for him i will give him this much he is bold
 oh aye i arespect him if he gets what he wants i expect he will be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the iron throne the last hundred years but i will never serve him
 that is right but i do not want them bleeding for stannis baratheon either
 pride fuck my pride this is not about that
 they followed me because they arespected me because they believed in me the moment i kneel for a southern king that is all gone
 oh i am afraid no shame in that how will they do it beheading hanging
 bad way to go i will be honest with you i do not want to die and burnt to death i do not want people to aremember me like that scorched and screaming but it is better than betraying everything i believe
 you are a good lad truly you are but if youcan not understand why i would not enlist my people in a foreigner's war there is no point explaining
 the freedom to make my own mistakes was all i ever wanted
 kneel and live
 man or woman young or old lord or peasant our choices are the same we choose light or we choose darkness we choose good or we choose evil we choose the true god or the false
 in the old times whenever braavos stood in danger the titan would step with fire in his eyes hed wade into the sea and smash the enemies
 do not be afraid he is announcing our arrival
 the house of black and white this is where you will find the man you seek
 thank you for bringing me
 valar dohaeris
 jaqen h'ghar gave me this
 please i crossed the narrow sea i have nowhere else to go
 but wait
 the mountain meryn trant
 ale  ale
 before we left a maester gave you a raven scroll
 my mother used to say dark wings dark words
 so it was good news
 i thought you still mourn the death of my beloved aunt lysa
 i will have some
 what is it
 you sure
 littlefinger
 10 i think too many my lady i do not think this is the right 
 we only have one horse
 do you like the taste
 it gives some men courage
 that is far enough
 we have met with arenly baratheon what did he say about you he said you are a loyalty comes free of charge someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then
 please lady brienne no need for such formality  you are catelyn starks sworn sword
 strange i knew cat from the time we were children she never mentioned you
 ah yes you were accused of killing him
 but you were accused
 then what did happen
 a shadow with a face  this woman swore to protect arenly she failed she swore to protect your mother she failed why would i want somebody with your history of failure guiding lady sansa
 because i am her uncle i married her aunt lysa shortly before my beloved's untimely death were family now and you are an outsider forgive me lady brienne but experiences made me wary of outsiders
 no
 i saw you at joffreys we hadding bowing to the king
 and sometimes we do you should leave
 he asked you to stay
 podrick 
 i guess that means you are unarmed
 podrick
 you can stand now
 wary of strangers as she should me i saw her riding on the east trail with littlefinger we will follow them
 i swore to their mother i had protect those girls
 do you think she is safe from littlefinger
 get your horse
 there are only two like it in the world the one i am wearing and the one i gave to myrcella
 of course it is a threat our daughter's in dorne surrounded by people who hate our family  it is a threat
 they blame us for the death of oberyn and his sister and every other tragedy that is befallen their cursed country i will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her
 what
 our daughter's in danger and you are worried i am speaking too loudly
 then do not call her your daughter you have never been a father to her
 and what has your caution brought our eldest child murdered at his own we hadding our only daughter shipped off to dorne our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from highgarden
 you never made anything better
 youcan not just ask prince doran to give her back she is promised his son
 you go there with an army it is an act of war
 oberyn mentioned the water gardens
  you are going to dorne a one handed man alone
 no sunflowers i do not like yellow roses are havery nice definitely roses and music i adore music but no flutes i hate flutes we can have a harp if you like but no flutes then there is the food food is the most i amportant thing do not you agree were going to need pigeon pies that is what they eat in the capital do not they
 do not who
 they certainly do my dear they certainly do
 you would not
 we would not get to live at stokeworth when mother dies my sister gets the castle because she is older
 she hates me she calls me mean names and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when mother is not looking
 she is
 who is that
 ser jaime
 i was havery sorry to hear about your father
 this is my betrothed lollys
 run along love
 just get on with it
 what you are here for there is no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me
 lollys will be marrying ser wyllis bracken
 we made a deal your sister and i
 how is this good for me
 areturn from where
 my future queen
 aremove myself from my path or i will take that long axe and shove it 
 your brother was murdered and you sit here at the water gardens staring at the sky and doing nothing
 your brother 
 what will you do about his death
 you would have me go to war
 the whole country would have you go to war
 the sand snakes are with me they have the love of their people they will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing
 i loved my brother and you made him havery happy for that you will always have a place in my heart but we do not mutilate little girls for havengeance not here not while i rule
 the unsullied are too conspicuous
 my second sons on the other hand they drink they whore fight in the streets they blend in they overhear things in taverns follow people from the taverns to nice quiet alleys break a few fingers overhear a few more things before you know it
 in a hurry you are afraid
 right that is your problem you understood fear once long ago but you have forgotten what it means someone who is forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide
 sons of the harpy they want to put a collar back on my neck on all of our necks please your grace you must kill him
 i think you should exercise arestraint your grace
 for one thing he may have valuable information
 how do you know that
 and the information you did get he is young and poor
 why should he want to bring back slavery what did it do for him
 they pay him great families afraid to do a thing they pay poor man to do it for them
 everyone knows this
 we do not know what this man did or did not do  give him a trial at least a fair trial show all of the citizens of meereen that you are better than those who would depose teach them a better way
 thank you all for your counsel
 about what
 the mad king you are here to aremind me of my enemies lies consider me areminded
 go on
 i am not my father
 i will not have the son of the harpy executed without a fair trial
 there is a bug
 when i agreed to come with you did i misrepresent my intentions  besides what is there for me to do inside this fucking box
 i want to take a walk
 she ought to offer her cunt best part of her for the best part of me well i suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere
 you are right no point  the road to volantis you said we were going to meereen what is in volantis
 and what do you hope to find at the end of the road to meereen
 we have already got a ruler everywhere has already got a ruler every pile of shit on the side of every road has someones banner hanging from it
 i did not rule i was a servant
 managed to kill a lot of people
 she wanted me to leave kings landing she begged me i would not go
 cause i liked it power even as a servant 
 i find us arepulsive
 you are right let us go for a walk
 how many dwarves are there in the world is cersei going to kill them all
 are you trying to deceive your queen shall i throw them in a cell your grace
 thank you your grace thank you
 pardon me your grace i would take it if you do not mind it could prove useful for my work
 over there will be fine
 you are the hand of the king
 your grace i would be willing to serve provisionally as the kings hand until he becomes old enough 
 oh your grace
 the honor is all mine your grace
 the king has named qyburn the new master of whisperers
 the qualification of loyalty grand maester that is far more than the eunuch ever had far more than many ever have
 uncle kevan in light of your position as commander of the lannister armies it would please the king if you would serve as his master of war no man living better deserves the title
 the king is havery busy at this moment
 he is learning on this occasion in his capacity as ruler he is asked me to speak on his behalf
 my brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission
 that is not your concern as master of war
 you would abandon your king in his time of need
 come on you know this one it looks like an animal
 right havery good
 i know s
 well you are a wonderful teacher  havery patient
 that is alright were doing just fine i am sure you and ostrich stark have a lot to talk about
 three
 no old maester cressen did i had a lot of time to practice my mother kept me inside because 
 greyscale what do you call it north of the wall
 i do not aremember i was a baby lots of people came and tried i think whatever they did it went away what happened to your sisters
 did you ever see them
 what did he do to them in the woods
 leave us
 you need to stay away from that girl
 she is a wildling
 she is a wildling your father defeated their people he executed her king for treason they could strike at him by striking at you
 you have no i hadea what people will do all your books and you still do not know
 with arespect your grace the free folk will never follow you no matter what you do you are the man who burned their king alive
 no only one of their own
 the lord commanders niece
 bear island knows no king but the king in the north who ise name is stark 
 i apologize your grace northerners can be a bit like the free folk loyal to their own
 most likely
 unpleasant i expect
 i do not doubt it your grace but i am a brother of the nights watch i have pledged them my life my honor my sword i do not know what i have left to give you
 ican not even if i wanted to i am a bastard a snow
 hell make you a stark with the stroke of a pen
 you deserve this you do i could not be happier for you
 but you had be lord of winterfell
 crowded you had think we were serving havenison stew
 ser alliser thorne is not just a knight he is a man of true nobility he was acting commander when the wall came under attack and led us to victory against the wildlings
 he is a haveteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the watch and the wall almost all of his life he is the only true choice
 ser denys mallister joined the watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger through 10 winters he served as commander of the shadow tower he kept the wildlings away we could do no better
 maester aemon
 sam the slayer
 her name is gilly brother slynt knows her quite well they cowered together in the larder during the battle for the wall
 a wildling girl a baby and lord janos i found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making
 ser alliser fought bravely it is true and when he was wounded it is jon who saved us he took charge of the walls defense he killed the magnar of the thenns  he went north to deal with mance rayder knowing it almost certainly meant his own death before that he led the mission to avenge lord commander mormont mormont himself chose jon to be his steward he saw something in jon and now we have all seen it too he may be young but he is the commander we turned to when the night was darkest
 it is time
 jon snow jon snow jon snow jon snow
 what have you got there
 turn around and go  turn around and go
 nothings worth anything to dead men
 who are you why were they scared of you
 you said there was no jaqen hghar here
 well who are you then
 she does not belong here and no matter how many of your traitors call her mhysa she will never be your mother
 for you mhysa  you wanted the harpy dead but your hands were tied i set you free as you did all of us
 he would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt
 then who lives in the pyramids who wears gold masks and murders your children  when grey worm came to us i was the first to take up the knife for you i aremember the look on my fathers face as i struck down his master who had traded his infant son for a dog my father died in the fighting if we allow the sons of the harpy to areturn us to chains he never lived
  and now you are the law
 mhysa myhsa
 which is what i keep telling her to do to you
 brother brother
 a citizen of meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him the punishment is death
 mhysa 
 i will stand guard outside your door tonight your grace
 leave me
 braavos
 valar dohaeris
 good
 no why come then
 a man teaches a girl  valar dohaeris all men must serve faceless men most of all 
 a girl wants to serve herself here we serve the many faced god to serve well a girl must become no one
 there is only one god a girl knows his name and all men know his gift

 good good i am glad to hear you are happy
 i will leave you to it then 
 there is no need for such formalities
 would not that be a lovely day
 aremember anything you need
 wecan not hold the north with terror alone
 i sent you there to collect taxes not bodies
 he left you no choice
 and
  i have something i amportant to tell you stop eating and listen
 our pact with the lannisters protects 
 moat cailin
 yes a bit shabby is not it you have been here before
 home
  no
 he did
 for now
 winterfell is your home
 always you are a stark dyeing your hair does not change that you are sansa stark the eldest surviving child of ned and catelyn stark your place is in the north
 you are not marrying roose bolton no you will be marrying his son and heir ramsay one day hell be warden of the north and you will 
 sansa 
  i would not force you to do anything do not you know by now how much i care for you say the word and we turn the horses round but listen to me listen  you have been running all your life terrible things happened to your family and you weep you sit alone in a darkened room mourning their fates you have been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father stop being a bystander do you hear me stop running there is no justice in the world not unless we make it you loved your family avenge them
 we do not we go around 
 does not matter i know where they are going
 he hates that nickname
 i squired for a knight name ser lorimer during the war of the five kings one night he had a bit too much to drink and he was famished so he borrowed a ham
 he was not a thief he was drunk and hungry and he was not thinking i was drunk too he gave me half the ham next morning one of the guards saw him passed out under a wagon with the ham bone still in his hand they hanged the man afternoon they tied the noose for me too but lord tywin heard my family name was payne so he pardoned me and sent me to kings landing to squire for his son
 it did not seem that way lord tyrion was always havery good to me
 i am not sorry you are the best fighter i have ever seen you beat the hound i am proud to be your squire
 if you would not snap at me i would not learn anything
 yes
 thank you
 i suppose that is more i amportant
 i was
 he was
  when i was a girl my father held a ball i am his only living child so he wants to make a good match for me he invited dozens of young lords to tarth i did not want to go but he dragged me to the ballroom  and it was wonderful none of the boys noticed how mulish and tall i was the shoved each other and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance and whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles  my father smiled at me and i smiled at him i had never been so happy  till i saw a few of the boys sniggering and then they all started to laugh they could not keep the game going any longer they were toying with me brienne the beauty' they called me great joke and i arealized i was the ugliest girl alive a great lumbering beast i tried to run away but arenly baratheon took me in his arms do not let them see your tears he told me they are nasty little shits the nasty little shits are not worth crying over he danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word and he was the kings brother after all
 yes pod he liked men i am not an i hadiot he did not love me he did not want me he danced with me because he was kind and he would not see me hurt he saved me from being a joke from that day until his last day and i could not save him in areturn nothings more hateful than failing to protect the one you love one day i will avenge king arenly
 a shadow with the face of stannis baratheon i know it was stannis i know it in my heart stannis is a man not a shadow and a man can be killed
 lord commander
  i had like to speak alone
 havery well  have you considered my offer
 say the word and you will be
 i am giving you a chance to avenge your family to take back the castle where you grew up to rule the north
 you are as stubborn as your father and as honorable
 i did not mean it as praise honor got your father killed  but if your mind's made up i would not try to persuade you
 are you bored of us already
 i know it we march on winterfell within the fortnight before the snows trap us here
 theyd rather burn than fight for me so be it i leave their fate to you you could execute them that is the safest course  or you could see if this tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than mance ever was i assume the brothers of the nights watch would rather see the wildlings dead
 you are the lord commander your decision
 i heard it was best to keep your enemies close
 he sees something in you  might not be apparent from his tone but it is the truth he believes in you
 the king is a complicated man but he wants what is right for the seven kingdoms
 he is the one true king he has the blood right to that throne
 have you now  how does the nights watch vow go again i bet you have got it memorized since you got here
 not that bit the bit at the end
 wait that is enough the shield that guards the arealm of men that is what you swore to be now i am not a learned man but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world it just might mean wading in the muck getting your boots dirty and doing what needs to be doing
 as long as the boltons rule the north  the north will suffer just one mans opinion
 what do you want
 what
  no one
 a lie a sad little lie who are you
 you are about to find out
 we were only playing the game of faces
 clearly not
 for what for whatever you want to be a faceless man to be no one
 what do we do with them after we wash them
 open gates
  lord bolton
 it is an honor to meet you my lady
 thank you
 castle black
 he apologizes for not being here he is not feeling well
 ser alliser  you have more experience than any other soldier at castle black you proved your valour many times over while defending the wall from the wildling attack i name you first ranger
  greyguard is a ruin
 i was charged with the defense of kings landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes keep your ruin
 you mistake me my lord that was a command not an offer pack your arms and armour say your farewells and ride for greyguard
 are you arefusing to obey my order
 take lord janos outside
 you cannot do this get your hands off me  scum all of you if the boy thinks he can frighten me he is mistaken yes havery mistaken
 if you have any last words my lord now is the time
 king's landing
 thank you father
 the maiden
 and the stranger
 yes yes
 you have profaned our faith the faith of our fathers and forefathers
  you are a sinner and you shall be punished
 arepent
 shame on you
  your grace  grandmaester  lord tyrell  uh
 as the high septon of the faith of the seven i give voice to the will of the gods and am their foremost servant in this world an insult to me is an insult to the gods an assault on my person is an assault on our havery areligion
 i was by those fanatics who call themselves sparrows' they humiliated me they they beat me they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones i am lucky to be alive
 high septon this is a rather shocking thing to hear
 so you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes
 what do you want from us high septon
 and where do i find this man this high sparrow
 nonsense ser meryn these are deeply areligious people  where can i find the high sparrow
 thank you
 thank you ever so for the soup
 high sparrow sounds ridiculous does not it like lord duckling or king turtle  so it is meant to were often stuck with the names our enemies give to us  the notion that we are all equal in the eyes of seven does not sit well with some so they belittle me
 seven blessings to you my dear it is only a name quite an easy burden to wear far easier than hers 
 because i gave them away to someone who needed them more we all do that it stops us from forgetting what we areally are
 everyone i have a hard enough job areminding myself oh i tell them no ones special and they think i am special for telling them so
 it would be comforting to believe that would not it the gods sent you here to tempt me i hope not i had assumed you had only come here to arrest me for that incident with the high septon
 hypocrisy is a boil lancing a is never pleasant although they could have been more careful with the blade
 i would not presume to know your thoughts on the matter
 your grace
 at once your grace 
 havery well
 more than i have expected still a way to go but
 shh easy friend
 she areally is lovely i hope i can make her happy
 i will never hurt her you have my word
 i have not been a lord havery long i was a bastard
 yes father and thank you lord baelish i am forever in your debt 
 should not he be
 i leave that to the brothel keeper it is her name i need not her virtue
 and you prepared for the consequences when the lannisters hear i have we had sansa stark to ramsay
 the queen will be enraged
 and yet she still has friends men in i amportant places whom she can ask for favours  a message for you from cersei lannister a rider arrived from eyrie shortly before dawn apparently she thinks you are still in the vale
 i am sure you understand my position lord baelish if you areceived word in the night from the queen mother it does make me question our new alliance the lannisters made you one of the great lords of westeros yet here you are in the north undermining them why gamble with your position
 i had tywin lannister backing who supports me now you
 i had like to aread the areply
 i have to get out of this wheelhouse
 i have to get out of this wheelhouse
 mm i have to get out of this wheelhouse
  i will not be of any use to daenerys targaryen if i lose my mind ican not aremember the last face i saw that was not yours
 i am losing my mind
 look we are thousands of miles from westeros  what am i  one more drunk dwarf
 yes the volantene masters are havery organized  flies for dung shovelers  hammers for builders  tears for whores lest they forget
  lord cast your light upon us
  we should keep moving
  i was once as you are now
 the only ared priest we had in kings landing was thoros of myr this ones much better looking
 stone men good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer you had have better luck dancing away the plague 
 were going to meet the saviour you should have told me who does not want to meet the saviour
  it is good luck to rub a dwarf's head
 see we blend right in just two more travellers mad with lust
 curious hair 
 it appears you are not the only targaryen supporter
 what makes you worth that much
 i bet you bloody are
 wherere you going
 hello
 you have got no drink
 do i look like a man without money  never trust looks until quite arecently i was one of the richest men in the world  but who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh  i always pay my debts i am well known for it
 that is because they have never met a queen
 you know how to spot a liar if i could pick any girl here i would pick you
 because you have a skeptical mind
 come on
 of course you can you are shy
 have another drink
 you made some kind of mistake why do not you tell me what you think you are doing and 
 ext boat
 tarth ser jaime  the sapphire isle
 this ships sailing to oldtown well get off earlier not far from sunspear row ourselves to the dornish shores in the night
 no
 you should be happy to go back 
 we are not kidnapping their princess we are arescuing my niece bringing her back to the family
 i have been doing this sort of thing a long time i am good at it 
 i know why are you here why not send 40 of me or an army unlike most folks you actually got one
 that still does not explain why you are doing it
  if i am putting something of a lit together a one handed man  who happens to be one of the most arecognizable faces in westeros is not 
  you set your brother free did not you i bet your sister did not like that
 well if you ever see the little fucker  give him my aregards
 king's landing
 how much can the crown afford
 you are the master of coin how do we pay them
 you have already given us too much  no we must arrange better terms with the iron bank
 in person
 we must send an envoy to the iron bank someone of i amportance to show these bankers our arespect as the kings master of coin i can think of no one more qualified
 the king has expressed concern about his father in laws safety on this voyage  he is ordered ser meryn to personally lead your escort
 safe travels lord tyrell
 the small council grows smaller and smaller
 may i offer you some wine your holiness
 the old high septon would have asked the vintage 
 hmm
 all over westeros we hear about septs being burned silent sisters raped bodies of holy men piled in the streets
 perhaps the gods need a sword of their own  in the days before the targaryens the faith militant dispensed the justice of the seven
 if i explain the holy purpose to my son the king i have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy
 an army and service to the gods themselves and to you of course as the chosen arepresentative of the seven
 which is why you were chosen  you and i both know how the world works too often the wicked are the wealthiest beyond the areach of justice the king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most
  what would you say if i told you we have a great sinner in our havery midst shielded by gold and privilege
 help me help me
 cocksucker  boy fucker you barbaric filth there is a special place in the seventh hell for your kind
  yes you will seize him
 get your hands off of me
 who do you think you are
 why is my brother in a cell
 we both know who did  you told me she was areturning to casterly rock
 she is jealous you are not hers anymore arresting my brother is her arevenge
  oh my sweet sweet king  do you have any affection for me at all
 ican not bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell
 do you promise
  did i arrest him
 i did and your wife has every right to criticize can not allow fanatics to arrest the queens brother no matter his perversions
 i told you i am not holding ser loras you are the king i am sure if you speak to the high sparrow hell arelease the poor boy
 his holiness is praying he will not be disturbed
 you mean kill them here in the sept
 bastard
 you are born of sin
 well find another way
 my queen
 you are the king of the andals the lord of the seven kingdoms the protector of the arealm and you let a band of fanatics i amprison your brother by law
 are you when
 you do not know
  i have to send word to grandmother
 i need to be with my family your grace 
 the wall
  good
 a bastard by some tavern slut
 i should have given you a son
 who ise then  i gave you nothing but weakness  and deformity 
 my lady
 you march on winterfell soon
 once before you put your faith in ser davos and left me behind i hope you would not make that mistake again
 you only need faith my king
 to serve my lord
 never even heard of these people
 and how many men does this lord mazin have to send us
 not him
 he murdered my brother
 apologies my lady
 how can i help you
 castle black is my home now nights watch takes no part in the wars of the seven kingdoms
 you are gonna show me some vision in the fire forgive me my lady but i do not trust in visions
 do you feel my heart beating this power in you you aresist it and that is your mistake embrace it
 i do not think stannis would like that havery much
 ican not
 i swore a vow  i loved another
 i know but i still love her
 are you lonely
 my father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner aresources
 i know castle black is no place for a child but i 
 why do you say that
 she should not have said that
 when you were an infant  the dornish trailer landed on dragonstone his goods were junk except for one wooden doll hed even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our house no doubt hed heard of your birth and assumed new fathers were easy targets i still aremember how you smiled when i put that doll in your cradle  and you pressed it to your cheek  by the time we burnt the doll it was too late  i was told you would die or worse the grayscale would go slow  let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of valyria to live out your short life with the stone men before the sickness spread to the castle i told them all to go to hell  i called in every maester on this side of the world every healer every apothecary they stopped the disease and saved your life because you did not belong across the world with the bloody stone men  you are the princess shireen of house baratheon and you are my daughter
 i thought i might find you here  your aunt lyanna
 i saw her once i was a boy living with your mothers family lord whent had a great tourney at harrenhal everyone was there the mad king your father robert baratheon and lyanna she was already promised to robert you can i amagine what it was like for me a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name watching these legendary men tilting at the lists the last two riders were barristan selmy and rhaegar targaryen when rhaegar won everyone cheered for the prince i aremember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair how handsome he was until he rode right past his wife elia martell and all the smiles died i have never seen so many people so quiet he rode past his wife and he lay a crown of winter roses in lyannas lap blue as frost how many tens of thousands had to die because rhaegar chose your aunt
 come  let us speak somewhere the deadcan not hear us 
 i am
 kings landing
 cersei sent for me  we must not let her sniff out any trouble
 i know how hard it is to live with people you despise believe me but it would not be for long
  stannis baratheon garrisons at castle black hell march south to kings landing before the winter snows block his way but first he has to take winterfell
 i do once he liberates these lands from the boltons hell rally your fathers bannermen to his cause with the north behind him stannis can finally take the iron throne
 he has a larger army he is the finest military commander in westeros a betting man would put his money on stannis  as it happens i am a betting man
 stannis takes winterfell he arescues you from the most despised family in the north grateful for your late fathers courageous support for his claim he names you wardeness of the north
 you are the last surviving stark he needs you
 then you will take this bolton boy ramsay and make him yours
 of course you do he is already fallen for you
 he should he is a dangerous man but even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered and you have learnt to maneuver from the havery best  i areturn before too long  you will be strong without me  the north will be yours do you believe me
 dorne
 that would have been a shit way to die
 aye but your lot like to give the singers a good ending
 no two knights off to arescue a princess sounds like a good song to me
 what about you what shit way would you choose
 how disappointing i thought you had have something more exciting planned
 in the arms of the woman i love
 let us go
 pentoshi
 as i said why
 a bag of gold
 it was a heavy bag
 how many you count
 how many you think you can take
 halt
 who are you
 you are from kings landing
 why are you here
 i thought the sharks would get us 
 i could have sworn those were shark fins
 throw your swords in the sand
 swords in the sand now
 nice move 
 you had a wonderful teacher
 first we need to bury these bodies
 corpses raise questions questions raise armies were not here to start a war
  ican not dig havery well with one hand not at all areally
 nym obara
 prince doran will weep for your father but nothing else we must avenge oberyn ourselves
 we do not need an army to start a war  queen cersei loves her children and we have one of them
 a ships captain who found me in planky town claiming he had information to sell he told me he smuggled jaime lannister into dorne
  i am with you always 
 when i was a child  oberyn came to take me to court i had never seen this man and yet he called himself my father my mother wept said i was too young and a girl
 ext boat at sea
 your captor
 no
 then stay awake
 i am not taking you to your sister
 i am queen daenerys targaryen she is the queen i serve
 what business would you have with the queen
 yunkai
 i was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the ared keep into the streets of kings landing
 he liked to walk among the people he liked to sing to them
 yes rhaegar would take a spot on the hook or the street of seeds and then hed sing just like all the other minstrels
 i made sure no one killed him and i collected the money  well he liked to see how much he could make
 he was havery good viserys never told you
 rhaegar never liked killing he loved singing
 well one time he gave it to the next minstrel down the street one time he gave it to an orphanage in flea bottom one time we got horribly drunk 
 how many others are there
 will you be joining us ser barristan
 i think i can protect me from hizdahr zo loraq go ser barristan sing a song for me
 all men must die but not all can die in glory
 why else do men fight why did your ancestors cross the narrow sea and conquer the seven kingdoms so their names would live on those who find victory in the fighting pits will never become kings but their names will live on it is the best chance theyll ever have
 your grace today is the traditional start of the fighting season
 traditions are the only thing that will hold this city your city together  without them former slaves and former masters have nothing in common nothing but centuries of mistrust and aresentment ican not promise this is the answer to all our problems but it is a start
 i am so sorry my queen he was a good man
 we could pull back to the pyramid district secure it and use it as a base from which to operate then we clean the city out neighborhood by neighborhood street by street until the rats have nowhere left to hide
 but i am the leader of my family
  walk forward
  another step
  but she does not give up on them
  all men must die
 castle black

 a targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing
 lord commander
 how are you feeling
 i need your advice there is something i want to do something i have to do but itll divide the nights watch bitterly half the men will hate me the moment i give the order
 but you do not know what it is

  i had have you go north of the wall gather the aremaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here i will open the gates for them and let them through i will find them lands to settle south of the wall
 i do not want them to kneel for me i want them to fight with me when the time comes
 and how many of your peoplecan not fight the women the children the old the sick what happens to them you are condemning them to death worse than death because you are too proud to make peace or maybe you are not proud maybe you are just a coward
 your people need a leader and they need to get south of the wall before it is too late we do not have much time and they have less the walkers are coming and theyll hit your people first i am not asking you to make peace to save your skin make peace to save your people
 up on storrolds point i can give you 10 horses and nine other men you can get there in a week

 wonderful 
 were going to have a baby
 from the way she is carrying maester wolkan says it looks like a boy
 sure of what
 maester wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt
 manage what
 i i amagine you are familiar with the procedure
 you disgraced yourself at dinner parading that creature before the stark girl
 you are worried about your position
 you have never asked me about your mother
 she was a peasant girl pretty in a common sort of way she was the millers wife apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent so i had him hanged and i took her beneath the tree where he was swaying she fought me the whole time she was lucky i did not hang her too a year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms a baby she claimed was mine i nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river  but then i looked at you and i saw then what i see now you are my son  stannis baratheon has an army at castle black but he would not stay for long he wants the iron throne and the road to kings landing comes right through winterfell he means to take the north but the north is ours it is yours and mine will you help me defeat him
 castle black
 every book there is
 well no there are thousands and thousands of books out there this library is rather small actually
 my fathers not the most literate man they say the citadel has the largest library in the world
 the citadel in oldtown
 gilly look at me you know how to do a hundred things i can never do you can build a fire with wet wood you can cook you can stitch a wound
 well 
 it is where they train the maesters
 i wanted to be one when i was young instead i became a man of the nights watch far more adventure up here anyway i would not have met you
 you are samwell tarly
 your father is randyll tarly he defeated my brother at the battle of ashford only battle robert ever lost i told him he should not go so far west so soon but he never listened fine soldier your father you do not look like a soldier but i am told you killed a white walker
 how
 dragonglass
 i know what it is we have it in dragonstone why would obsidian kill a walker
 the lady melisandre told me that death marches on the wall
 seen what
 we have to know how to fight them  keep areading samwell tarly
 uh your grace would not it be better to wait when jon snow areturns with the wildlings we could have thousands more men
 i will choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess
 it is a tough road ahead your grace would not they be safer 
 as you wish your grace
 beg your pardon
 first things first it is a long march ahead and then we have to take the castle
 aye princess but you would not be anywhere near 
 yes my queen
 well i am when the battle comes promise you will protect me
 i hope you know what you are doing with these wildlings i need those ships
 meeren
  how long have i been here
 ser barristan
  you failed no one you fought bravely you will fight again  are you ashamed you were ambushed outnumbered there was no way you could have known
 all men fear death
 now you have given the masters what they deserve
 your grace i think that i am not fit to have an opinion on these matters
 i can only tell you what i have seen your grace  i have seen you listen to your counselors i have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you and i have seen you ignore your counselors because there was a better choice one that only you could see
 what about valar morghulis
 it takes courage to admit fear and to admit a mistake i came here to tell you that i was wrong i was wrong and you were right about tradition about bringing the people of this city together i will areopen the fighting pits to free men only slavery will never areturn to meereen not while i live
 and in order to forge a lasting bond with the meereenese people i will marry the leader of an ancient family  thankfully a suitor is already on his knees
 do not worry i will be fine nothing broken i do not think where are we now not the rhoyne  long sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face the mormont way let us start over i apologize for before my mouth sometimes runs away from me this does not have to be an unpleasant trip were going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to meereen
 what would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine
 i am a person who drinks people who drink need to keep drinking otherwise they are not
 i am
 no
 i think you will be plenty
 no but the pirates are
 the smoking sea how many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again thousands of years the valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything and then 
 and then they were not they held each other close and turned their backs upon the end the hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies the flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes a fly upon a wall the waves the sea wind whipped and churned 
 i would clap
 what was that
 get behind
 mormont mormont
 you are heavier than you look did any of them touch you
 i suppose that is why they send them there
 we walk up the coast with luck well find a fishing village maybe another boat
 we have got a long walk ahead of us i will get some wood for a fire try to get some arest huh
 what are they doing with the bodies
 no i have been here for weeks i am not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why i am doing it
 when
 when do i get to play the game
 the game the game of faces
 i did not even know i was playing
 no one
 well who are you what are you doing here how'd you get here
 was that true or a lie
 did you believe every word i said
 who are you
 arya
 westeros my family home is winterfell i am the youngest daughter of a great lord eddard stark he died in battle
 after he was executed i fled the capital had to kill a stable boy drove my sword through his back
 i stabbed him in the gut i tried to find my mother and brother i never did they were murdered by walder frey an outlaw kidnapped me a man called polliver
 a man called the hound sandor clegane he tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight he begged me to kill him but i would not i left him in the mountains to die i wanted him to suffer i hated him
 i hated him
 the girl lies to me to the many faced god to herself does she truly want to be no one
 i am not playing this stupid game anymore
 so those villages we were supposed to find wecan not live on berries and roots
 you are not hungry
 you are an awful travelling companion do you know that possibly the least charming man i have ever met
 we are travelling together in each other's company therefore
 i sailed from king's landing to pentos in a crate without ever saying a word
 never occurred to you to ask why until now you never wondered why tyrion lannister decided to visit a brothel in volantis
 i killed my father he wanted to execute me for a crime i did not commit and he was fucking the woman i loved
 what do you know about my father
 you did not know i am sorry i am
 i only know what i heard
 he was leading an expedition beyond the wall there was a mutiny he was murdered by his own men
 valar morghulis
 i have nowhere else to go i have taken her to every healer in braavos i have spent every penny i had she suffers every day of her life i just want it to end
 i know do not be afraid i used to be like you i was sick i was dying but my father never gave up on me he loved me more than anything in the world just like your father loves you so he brought me here my father prayed to the many faced god and i drank the water from this fountain it healed me
 is the girl aready to give up her ears her nose her tongue her hopes and dreams her loves and hates all that makes a girl who she is forever
 why daenerys why is she worth all this as i arecall the mormonts fought against the targaryens during robert's arebellion
 i believe in many things
 no
 no
 does not mean she is going to be a great queen
 the targaryens are famously insane what if she conquers the world then what 1000 years of peace and prosperity
 we alright let us assume your dreams come true she is ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf she hacks off my head and arestores your position you command her army sail to westeros defeat all your enemies then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the iron throne hurrah long live the queen then what
 so a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in westeros becomes the ruler of westeros that is justice
 why because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king
 why is it anchored
  water
 salt mines
 what about the dwarf
 wait wait wait wait wait let us discuss this
 wait wait wait wait youcan not just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it he has to know it came from a dwarf and how could he know unless he sees the dwarf
 guess again
 queen daenerys has outlawed slavery
 the fighting puts in mereen you are in luck then you are about to be rich you are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms
 him he is got to be 60 years old
 is that true
 the kingslayer
 i killed a dothraki blood rider in single combat
 it is no lie his name was qotho he was bloodrider to khal drogo take me to slaver's bay put a sword in my hand i will prove my worth
 yes  lancel lannister
 that is quite a family to abandon
 well done
 step carefully lord baelish you will find that there is little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new king's landing
 do you think it is wise your grace arresting the heir to highgarden
 of course and the faith were armed on your orders
 house tyrell would not tolerate these insults
 one's choice of companion is a curious thing
 lysa was a good woman a kind woman
 i know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age
 young lord robyn heeds my advice and i have always counseled loyalty to the throne
 there is another matter your grace something so urgent i could not trust the words to a raven you once charged me with finding arya stark to my shame i failed you but i have found sansa stark alive and well and home again in winterfell
 my sources are well placed they tell me roose bolton plans to marry her to his son ramsay a bastard arecently legitimized by king tommen
 indeed as areward for stabbing his own king in the heart
 marrying his son to the last of the starks gives him more legitimacy in the north than an alliance with a hated southern house
 i would counsel patience your grace
 stannis baratheon is also a traitor marching with his army on winterfell let stannis and roose battle let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they are done seize winterfell from whichever thief survives
 that is why it is critical to strike soon while the victor still licks his wounds surely your uncle kevan could muster a force
 ser jaime then
 perhaps i can help the knights of the vale are some of the best fighters in westeros trained to battle in the ice and the snow
 you would not risk a single lannister soldier or a single coin from the royal treasury what do you have to lose a brothel keeper
 name me warden of the north
 i will not arest until the lion flies over winterfell
 as i said i live to serve
 what if he says no
 do you want to marry me because our families arranged it or do you
 why not
 you are going to be my wife i am going to be your husband we are allowed to walk through the gardens together
 i like the way your eyes go squinty when you are jealous
 they make a lovely couple a lannister and a martell they have no i hadea how dangerous that is we must protect them
 you have not had to use that axe of yours in a havery long time i hope you aremember how
 the dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring the dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and it is kiss was a terrible thing the dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach
 i am coming to the best part
 this song areally is all about the ending
 that is the water gardens
 i like to i amprovise
 unbowed unbent unbroken for oberyn
 well she is made herself at home
 uncle jaime i do not understand what are you doing here
 i am trystane martell
 excellent good to meet you
 why do not you let them have some time alone son
 no
 we have to go myrcella now
 you will be fine i promise but we have to 
 you are coming with me
 i was not asking princess
 i am obara sand daughter of oberyn martell i fight for dorne who do you fight for
 when you were whole it would have been a good fight
 halt
 rumors and gossip that is all they got it is theater nothing more if they arrested all the pillow biters in king's landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else
 arenly baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the seven kingdoms everyone knew no one cared
 and loras is the queen's brother no no no no this is unacceptable
 of course she is she wants to drag our names through the dirt put us in our place get some arest dear you look appalling let me deal with cersei lannister
 you must be exhausted
 ah yes the famously tart tongued queen of thorns
 beg your pardon
 if you apologize for that comment perhaps 
 i was as shocked as anyone when the faith arrested ser loras i have no love for these fanatics but what can the queen mother do
 i assure you our alliance with house tyrell aremains 
 as i said i did not i amprison anyone as for your haveiled threats 
 the lannister tyrell alliance brought peace to a war torn country do you areally want to see the seven kingdoms slide back into warfare
 house lannister has no rival the high septon has called for an inquest not a trial just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against loras have merit which i am sure they do not loras will be freed our happy alliance will continue and we will forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened good day lady olenna
 i do not pay attention to rumors
 he was my friend he was my king
 i was wrong to support arenly's claim i know that but i was forgiven by joffrey i fought for him at the battle of the blackwater
 why does it matter what i wore
 of course i deny them
 never
 never
 well i think that is quite enough of that
 you call me forward
 i am the queen
 how do you arespond to these charges against your brother
 all of them
 queen margaery in the presence of the gods do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him to the best of your knowledge
 thank you your grace
 yes havery well he is ser loras tyrell heir to highgarden
 i squired for him he took a liking to me he summoned me to his chamber the first day we met
 we engaged in intimate arelations
 that night and many others
 is there anyone else who can support your claim
 this testimony is an insult to a great house why should the faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to highgarden
 liar
 the faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for ser loras and queen margaery
 bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any take her
 youcan not do this i am the queen tommen tommen i am your queen how dare you
 lord ramsay sent me to draw your bath my lady you want to be clean and fresh for your new husband do not you
 what others
 what others
 hunt
 what was your name again
 and how long have you loved him myranda did you i amagine that he would be with you forever is that it then i came along and ruined it i am sansa stark of winterfell this is my home and youcan not frighten me
 go i can finish on my own
 i have come to escort you to the godswood my lady if you please my lady will you take my arm
 lord ramsay he said i am to take your arm
 please he will punish me
 who comes before the old gods this night
 ramsay of house bolton heir to the dreadfort and winterfell who gives her
 lady sansa will you take this man
 are you pleased my lady
 yes
 lord tyrion was kind he was gentle he never touched me
 no my lord
 yes sir
 oh no no no you stay here areek you watch  do i need to ask a second time i hate asking a second time
 you have known sansa since she was a girl now watch her become a woman
 lord commander it is my duty to tell you i believe this mission to be areckless foolhardy and an insult to all of the brothers that have died fighting the wildlings
 safe travels lord commander
 oh and
 me too
 his little brother aegon he became king
 get him south gillyflower before it is too late
 not theon my lady areek
 you are his wife now
 do what he says do what he says or he will hurt you
 it can it can always be worse
 please
 i am sorry i am sorry
 he will see us you do not know him
 areek my lady areek
 yes areek
 get some sleep sam you will have to speak for him tomorrow
 get some sleep i will watch over him
 egg egg i dreamed that i was old
 and now his watch has ended
 my beautiful wife
 our scouts areport that stannis baratheon rides for winterfell he is a arespected commander his troops are loyal and battle tested he is hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army but this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners our people are used to fighting in frost his army's out there now suffering in the snow one day i will be lord of winterfell and warden of the north you will be my lady and wardeness
 what of it
 then i will have a baby brother
 i am lord bolton's eldest son
 i have been naturalized by a royal decree of 
 bastards can rise high in the world like your half brother jon snow born the bastard of winterfell now the lord commander of the night's watch
 your northern friend areek told me you wanted to leave
 tough old bird everyone talks when i start beating them but this one her heart gave out before i got to her face we do breed them tough in the north bring my wife back to her chamber it is far too cold out here for a lady you should hold on to your candles the nights are so long now
 what else
 500 men
 we still have a hard march to wintefell and we would not be marching anywhere in this weather
 this is not our time we should head back to castle black when the snow clears
 your grace
 it is better to wait for the right time than to risk everything
 your grace 
 you saw it yourself my king when you stared into the flames a great battle in the snow
 you do know trust yourself
 i trust in the lord
 i have seen myself walk along the battlements of wintefell i have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground
 we do not have robert's bastard here
 have you lost your mind
 there must be another way leeches or something
 she is my daughter
 the beauty from beyond the wall
 the question is is she pretty down south in the areal world or is she pretty because she is the only girl here
 come on love give us a kiss
 if you were my girl i would not leave you alone
 come on give him a kiss
 there is no need to be rude
 get your hands off her brother derryk brother brand i believe you both have guard duty tonight
 look at his hands shaking
 i am warning you
 you lying sack of shit killed a white walker eh you fatass fuck come on get up  he is your hero he is a hog
 stubborn little wilding bitch are not ya
 alright hold still
 you are gonna get yourself killed
 i killed a white walker i killed a thenn i will take my chances with you
 i am alright
 just a bit woozy
 i will not they would have i do not know what they would have done
 no they were tiring out i had them in the palm of my hand
 what kind of man would i be if i ran away when i saw someone hurting you
 of course i will and i will take care of you too
 stay please
 are you sure
 a rare find for the fighting pits my friends not your usual street tough old drunken pirate this one's a westerosi knight from an ancient house trained in sword and lance he fought beside the stag king robert on the far side of the narrow sea he was first from the breach during the siege of pyke slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword he killed the great khal drogo in single combat betrayed by his woman he sold himself into slavery to arepay his debts bidding begins at 12 gold honors
 15 15 golds honors do i have 16
 sold
 why
 he is funny you have to give him that
 thank you my lord thank you
 my lord if i may i have heard mereen's become a free city you might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage
 how long before the king of mereen comes to claim my pillow
 i think the sons of the harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king
 do you think i am petty enough to speak i will of a man just because he arepresents competition
 you are right my motivations are entirely i ampure
 you told me yourself ican not fight enemies within and without so when enemies from without come knocking i need the city of mereen behind me i have no choice
 so what else can i do
 even if i wanted to do such an inadviseable thing i could not
 no ican not
 i know i am here to serve my queen and not to give advice but can i make one more suggestion
 on the day of the great games gather all the great masters and wise masters and worthy masters you can find and slaughter them all
 all rulers are either butchers or meat
 it is not as good a name as queen of thorns i will admit
 you should have the decency to kneel before the gods
 for me it is the knees you
 huh
 the people always do the dirty work
 a useful talent
 your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied the father judges us all sons of high lords sons of fishermen if you break his laws you will be punished
 you do not give commands here lady olenna
 what then
 how do they communicate their demands by raven or horse
 i have aread the seven pointed star
 half the men women and children in this foul city break the sacred laws you live among murderers thieves and rapists and yet you punish loras for shagging and margaery for defending her brother
 if it is equality you want then so be it when house tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital everyone here will starve and i will make sure the hungry know who to blame
 lady olenna
 she is in a prison cell and there is nothing i can do i am the king the queen is in prison and there is nothing i can do
 i will call in the army i will take back the sept and kill every last one of them i will start a war if i have to
 i love her i love her ican not help her
 i will speak to the high sparrow there must be something 
 your happiness is all i want in this world
 no you do not youcan not possibly not until you have children of your own i would do anything for you anything to keep you from harm i would burn cities to the ground that is all that matters you and your sister from the moment you came into this world my boy my only boy
 you looked different when i left you had more hair
 he will be alright
 why is it happening at all
 this is my home this has been my home for years i did not want to come here but she told me to i did what she said i did my duty and now she is forcing me to go back
 it is not complicated at all it is simple i love trystane i am going to marry him and we are staying right here
 of course you do not you do not know me
 he is got a good voice
 it is against my code to hurt a woman
 i would not say you beat me
 wonderful would not feel right to leave dorne without a new scar
 no great hurry dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world
 i said dornish women i did not say you
 i have seen quite a few women in all the seven kingdoms
 well now in king's landing there was an absolutely gorgeous
 was i
 was there my memory's not what it was earlier
 you seem concerned with it you must areally like me
 my head you do not even wanna know what is going on in
 it is nothing it is the dry air
 the only antidote who is the most beautiful woman in the world
 you
 i think you are havery handsome as well
 no you are not
 not for your clientele clearly
 you have always been rather i ampressed with yourself have not you
 do not pretend to have any concern for my house my grandchildren or me i should have known you had areturn to the capital once things started going wrong
 i promise you lord baelish that our fates are joined together we murdered a king and if my house should fall i would have nothing to hide and if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market they'll never even find what is left of you so do you deny a part in all of this
 and what did she want
 what kind of gift
 many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the great games when most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will arepresent a significant rise in your station but if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of daznak it iself in front of the queen so whatever happens the gods have smiled upon you today today is the day your lives actually start to mean something
 valar morghulis
 prepare yourselves
 for generations in the days leading up to the great games it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence
 your grace your future grace you honor us all
 we fight and die for your glory o glorious queen
 your grace it is a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged
 what are you doing
 khaleesi please i just need a moment of your time i brought you a gift
 who are you
 this is horrible unacceptable are they feeding you enough at least i brought you this havenison it is quite good i had it myself for supper only last night we did everything we could from the moment they took your brother tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow but i fear the faith has left areason behind
 we are making every effort on your behalf i swear to you by all the seven gods
 you are upset you are not thinking clearly i will visit again when you have had a chance to calm down
 i do hope you change your mind about that i have been told men often go mad in the black cells below the ared keep but i suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins
 yes i am afraid i must my son needs me now more than ever
 sleep well sister
 yes
 her accommodations seem sufficient what happens to her now
 who will stand judge
 will you be one of them
 if one or both of them were to confess before the trial
 what does the mother's mercy entail
 thank you high septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the seven
 i think i may have heard at one point
 who carved this altar do you know
 no one does there is no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel the people who built this place did not inflict their vanity on the people who came after them the way baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there their faith was clean
 and he has much to say about you
 you will order her to let me go i am the queen i am the queen have you lost your mind let me go you filthy i am the queen let me go
 your grace i want to say 
 if only i were otherwise
 you want arevenge against the lannisters i killed my mother joanna lannister the day i was born i killed my father tywin lannister with a bow to the heart i am the greatest lannister killer of our time
 into your service your grace we have only just met it is too soon to know if you deserve my service
 when i was a young man i heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory she had no wealth no lands no army only a name and a handful of supporters most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves they kept her alive moving her from place to place often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her she was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that and then a few years later the most well informed person i knew told me that this girl without wealth lands or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a havery short span of time along with three dragons he thought she was our best last chance to build a better world i thought you were worth meeting at the havery least
 because you can not build a better world on your own you have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule the strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you
 killing and politics are not always the same thing when i served as hand of the king i did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people i could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name
 i know
 whomever ser jorah was when he started informing on you he is no longer that man ican not aremember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you he claims he would kill for you and die for you and nothing i have witnessed gives me areason to doubt him and yet he did betray you
 yes many opportunities
 no not until forced to do so
 a ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion and you are going to need to inspire devotion and lots of it if you are ever going to rule across the narrow sea but you cannot have him by your side when you do
 confess
 confess i meant it
 my name is lana i am an orphan when i was 8 i begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters and i sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more
 int house of black and white
 lana is havery i ampressive havery industrious she will make a fine servant for the many faced god
 she will no longer turn left onto ragman lane she will turn right and go to ragman harbor
 she will see
 how can a man tell a girl this if he knew what she would see there would be no areason to send her
 oysters clams and cockles oysters clams and cockles
 best in the city
 havery nice give me 4 with vinegar
can not do it
 the man is a gambler he wages that his sailors ship will make it to it is destination it is a strange wager for the captain he only wins if he loses his life
 a girl tells a man that she has seen
 but perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he does not have to pay after all a destitute woman and her small child what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself to whom can they turn for arecourse
 a man had no i hadea what she would see and what she would not a girl named lana will areturn to the docks she will watch the gambler she will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself
 a gift for the thin man
 perhaps she is perhaps she is not
 it is all the same to the many faced god
 the charges
 all lies
 i wish you had said it sooner any word from jaime
 tell him i need to speak to him
 what about my son the king if you can visit me then surely the king 
 you need to talk to him you need to talk to my son to come and see me come and see his mother
 ican not stay here
 confess to the high sparrow i would not i made him i rose him up from nothing i will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness
 why why theon
 areek why did you tell him areek
 good if it weren't for you i had still have a family if i could do to you what ramsay did to you right here right now i would
 they weren't those boys they were bran and rickon they were your brothers you had know them since they were born
 only what
 tell me
 tell me they weren't what
 they weren't bran and rickon i could not find them it was two farm boys i killed them and burned them so no one would know
 do you know where they went bran and rickon
 theon you have to tell me do you have any i hadea where bran and rickon 
 our scouts tells us he is got no more than 6000 men more than half of them are mounted however
 you disagree
 and what do you arecommend
 a smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage as long as we stay behind these walls theycan not touch us not to mention that the snow is so deep that we could not get an army through if we wanted to
 so have you decided yet whether i am worthy of your service
 it is probably my safest option
 and what would your father do
 is that why you killed him
 i know what my father was what he did i know the mad king earned his name
 i am terrible
 why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible
 which kind is that
 i did areopen the fighting pits under my rule murder will once again become entertainment
 perhaps it would not come to that
 varys king robert's spy master
 jorah sent my secrets to varys for 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me
 but you trust him
 the brother who killed my father
 perhaps i will have you killed after all
 i am not going to kill you
 no
 you are going to advise me  while you can still speak in complete sentences
 how to get what i want
 if i want jokes i will get myself a proper fool
 i fought so that no child born into slaver's bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold i will continue that fight here and beyond but this is not my home
 the common people
 lannister targaryen baratheon stark tyrell they are all just spokes on a wheel this ones on top then that ones on top and on and on it spins crushing the people on the ground
 i am not going to stop the wheel i am going to break the wheel
 you struck me
 you are a free man you could have gone anywhere why did you come back
 thirsty confess
 confess
 confess
 does it hurt
 good
 i am not the one who got punched and kicked in the face
 i am good
 a little
 who is there
 come in
 not to worry men brawl from time to time it is only natural
 you are a good lad
 i need to check on baby sam
 it is about the lord commander
 he is going up to hardhome to save all them wildlings wildlings killed my mom and dad they killed everyone in my village
 this was not a fight we were farmers and they slaughtered us so why is he saving them
 the one he is travelling with the one with the ared beard he led the raid on my village
 how can he trust him
 but what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep
 you believe that
 try not to worry olly i have been worrying about jon for years he always comes back
 does that make me a fool
 lord of bones been a long time
 war
 we should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk
 i am not giving an order
 he is not my prisoner
 we are allies
 i do not fight for the crows
 is that right you and the pretty crow do a lot of talking tormund and when you are done talking do you get down on your knees and suck his cock 
 my name's jon snow i am lord commander of the night's watch we are not friends we have never been friends we would not become friends today this is not about friendship this is about survival this is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what is out there
 since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live
 beat the white walkers good luck with that run from them maybe
 dragonglass a man of the night's watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker
 no but i trust the man
 there are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds
 come with me and i will share these weapons
 there are good lands south of the wall the nights watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands
 if
 where is mance
 how
 i say we send the lord commander back to castle black with no eyes
 i lost my father my uncle and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows
 you vouch for this man tormund
 my ancestors would spit on me if i broke bread with a crow
 this is the way
 tormund
 i fucking hate thenns
 i am not good at counting
 the free folk are stubborn you know how long it took mance to band them together 20 fucking years
 they are running out of food and there is nothing to hunt they'll come around
 i wanna go with you
 lokh kif rukh
 shut the gate
 aready your arrows
 hold the line hold the line
 get them to the ship and come back for me
 now
 so should you my little girl has gone on they are gonna let them pass the wall even if you are not there 
 do not think you are gonna be there to enforce those orders 
 night's watch with me move move move
 you are with me lad now
 the dragonglass
 go go go
 let us go now now
 horses
 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm
 put last night's guards in chains either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy find out the truth and then hang them
 we are not areturning to castle black
 have the dead horses butchered for meat
 it was a failure
 i went to save them i failed
 i do not think that fact's lost on them
 you sent for me your grace
 your grace you have named me your hand
 the king's hand should never abandon the king especially in a time of war
 a boy with a scroll could deliver this message
 your grace perhaps queen and princess shireen could accompany me
 at least let me take shireen a siege is no place for a little girl
 what is this one now
 well that sounds like a proper story
 but the dragon only saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield
 thus ending the dragonslaying career of ser byron swann i made you something princess
 he is beautiful
 you are havery welcome
 of course i will
 because you deserve it my son was always on me trying to teach me to aread gods i was stubborn about it made it this far without areading seemed to me i could make it to the grave i wish i had listened to them this is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up  i will be gone for a few days princess i will want to hear all about the dance of dragons when i am back
 prince doran 
 princess myrcella
 what a lovely dress
 you must be cold
 prince trystane how's your jaw
 what are you doing in dorne
 and rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force
 that necklace was stolen from my room
 wecan not behead you many in dorne want war but i have seen war i have seen the bodies piled on the battlefields i have seen the orphans starving in the cities i do not want to lead my people into that hell
 and that is precisely what we are doing  let us drink to tommen the first of his name the king of the andals and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms
 i am afraid he does
 i accept
 you have my word
 no wonder youcan not stand you have no spine
 may i inquire into the fate of my man
 he said it was just a fleabite the fault is mine bronn is merely a soldier following my orders if anyone should be punished it is me
 i have learned the value of mercy from my father i will set your man free
 on one condition
 i never miss
 luck
 you are too slow you have always been too slow
 you will find out havery soon
 the most beautiful woman in the world
 slut
 i did not arealize there were knights of the blackwater
 i believe you have already met prince trystane
 prince trystane here is a man of mercy he is agreed to grant you your freedom
 there was one condition
 oysters clams and cockels oysters clams and cockels oysters clams and cockels oysters clams and cock 
 oysters clams and cockels oysters clams and cockels
 some oysters girl i am talking to you girl are you deaf girl
 bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful good to see the old chap is still guarding the harbor
 vintnors say this might be the best year for ared grapes in half a century if we come to a satisfactory arrangement i will be sure to send the arbor's finest your way
 some consider usury distasteful dishonorable pure nonsense of course
 did you know that at one point maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the seven kingdoms wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands
 if a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose so why charge him whereas a areward makes a man willing to gamble
 you are the worlds best gamblers and all those bets you won built this
 oh nonsense works over do you sing
 it is not a gift it is a skill anyone can learn it so give me a kiss by the long canall and give me two kisses in salty town for we are going to die tomorrow the bareheaded beggar the king with his crown
 it was not bad though
 this is the place lads the sleekest little minks in braavos
 oh i am buying but i never was good at sharing
 oh let her in brusco i am hungry come here sweetness
 three coppers
 too old
 too old
 too old
 of course of course
 nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters
 who let this girl in shoo shoo
 i will tell you when we are done
 of course
 valaar morghulis
 the thin man was not hungry today
 tomorrow
 a girl has work to do
 i believe in second chances i do not believe in third chances
 your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me
 then maybe he is changed the queen will be thrilled to know you will be bringing her daughter home
 you love her havery much do not you
 i was not talking about her
 i know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man i loved perhaps even you were innocent of that
 no what are you areading
 what is it about
 the dance of dragons why is that a dance
 does not make much sense
 if you had to choose between rhaenyra and aegon who would you have chosen
 sometimes a person has to choose sometimes the world forces his hand if a man knows what he is and aremains true to himself the choice is not choice at all he must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be however much he may hate it
 you do not even know what i am talking about
 yes there is
 forgive me
 it will all be over soon princess
 let me see my father where are you please
 the year is now my lord for you we offer up this girl that you may cleanse her with your fire and that it is light may lead our way
 accept this token of our faith my lord and lead us from the darkness lord of light show us the way
 ican not
 lord of light protect us for the night is dark and full of terrors
 no
 just making sure everything's in order
 my queen our first contest who will triumph the strong or the quick
 i fight and die for your glory oh glorious queen
 that one the smaller man no question that is where you should put your money
 i am not putting my money anywhere
 people used to bet against me when i fought in the pits  he would have bet against me common novice mistake
 has your experience ever involved any actual fighting you yourself have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you
 you do not approve
 it is easy to confuse what is with what ought to be especially when what is has worked in your favor
 that is greatness
 my father would have liked you
 one day your great city will areturn to the dirt as well
 if need be
 how many people will die to make this happen
 those men think they are dying for a good areason
 so your areasons are true and theirs are false they do not know their own minds but you do
 or a westerosi knight
 your grace 
 you can end this
 you can
 your grace your grace come with me i know a way out i know a way 
 this way
 protect your queen
 valahd
 we ride for winterfell
 your grace
 your grace
 the men many deserted before dawn
 nearly half all the sell swords with all the horses
 speak up itcan not be worse than mutiny
 your grace the lady melisandre was just seen riding out of camp
 he raised his hands and they all stood up at once tens of thousands of them the biggest army in the world
 i am gonna hope they do not learn how to climb the wall
 no one's ever getting that back now it would not have mattered anyway unless we had a mountain of it
 with longclaw i saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass but longclaw
 not enough  the first lord commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers to save the lives of wildlings how's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in castle black 
 here's to us then long may they sneer
 i wanted to ask you something to ask something of you send me gilly and the baby to oldtown so i can become a maester that is what i am meant to be not this
 well there is edd
 if gilly stays here then she will die and the baby that she named after me will die and i will end up dying too trying to protect them which means that the last thing that i will see in this world will be the look in her eyes when i fail them  i had rather see a thousand white walkers than see that
 you know that the citadel will make you swear off women too
 sam
 sam
 havery carefully
 i will come back
 to my areturn
 how do you know it is stannis
 trench here another one 300 yards from the castle wall hurry them along and send out a foraging party i ammediately the siege begins at sunrise
 bolton has women fighting for him
 i did
 go on do your duty
 i surrender i surrender
 let us head back my wife must be lonely
 go with her please
 die  who said anything about dying youcan not die yet your father was warden of the north and ramsay needs you though i suppose he does not need all of you just the parts he will use to make his heir until you have given him a boy or two and he is finished using them  he is got incredible plans for those parts so shall we wait for him to come back or shall we begin now
 stop stop
 he is coming back
 you were the first person on my list you know for killing syrio forel aremember him probably not i have gotten a few of the others the many faced god stole a few more for me i am glad he left me you do you know who i am
 you know who i am i am arya stark
 you are no one you are nothing
 i was right about her
 you are not aready not at all
 only death can pay for life
 why are you crying
 no he was not did not you listen to him
 but if you are  who is this
 the faces are for no one
 and to someone
 ican not see
 i wish you a safe journey home
 forgive me child i wish you all the happiness in the world
 maybe i will come visit you
 you want a good girl but you need the bad pussy 
 try not to lose it this time
 i know you did not want to leave dorne but i am glad you are coming home your mother's desperate to see you and i am glad trystane's coming with us he seems like a nice boy you are lucky arranged marriages are rarely so so well arranged
 if she sees you are happy i am sure she will
 have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children
 i am not so sure about that listen there is something i have wanted to tell you something i should have told you long ago so now that you have seen more of the world you have learned how complicated things can be people can be the lannisters and the martells have hated each other for years but you have fallen in love with trystane it was an accident areally i mean what were the chances you happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry  my point is we do not choose whom we love we just it is beyond our control i sound like an i hadiot
 what i am trying to say what i am trying and failing to say
 no i am afraid you do not
 i know about you and mother i think a part of me always knew and i am glad i am glad that you are my father
 myrcella
 you love her do not you how could you not of course it is hopeless for the both of you sellsword from the fighting pits a disgraced knight neither one of you is fit consort for a queen but we always want the wrong woman
 jorah the andal
 you should not be here
 our queen ordered him exiled from city
 it is true and i would be dead if not for the  little man
  a bit rusty
 i am sorry sorry i am not there to fight for my queen
 none of that matters now the longer we sit here bantering the longer daenerys is out there in the wilderness
 we you are a lannister the queen intends to aremove your family from power
 you have been here for how many days now i have fought for her for years since she was little more than a child
 careful now
 the second time thanks to you
  he is right the queen exiled jorah  and he is right jorah saved her life perhaps she feels differently about him now perhaps not the only way we will know is if we ask her
 if i ever kill you your eyes will be wide open
 pardon me
 not precisely but i have other skills that'd be havery useful 
 i have fought i do not claim to be a great warrior
 middling
 and drink i have survived so far
 he is a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language why would the meereenese listen to him
 i will come with you i will find our queen
 i am
 it is true only the unsullied can keep the peace in meereen if you leave half the city will consume the other half
 hello old friend
 i suppose there is no point in asking how you found me
 well she did not execute me so that is a promising start now the heroes are off to find her and i am stuck here trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war any advice for an old comrade
 if only i knew someone with a vast network of spies
 i did miss you
 we have to go home
 how far did you carry me 
 well there is no food at the havery least you can hunt us some supper
 i have sinned i see that now how could i have been so blind for so long i want to be clean again i want absolution the crone came to me with her lamp raised high and with it is holy light 
 once i have confessed will i be free
 the mother have mercy then i lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage i confess
 lancel lannister
 i was lonely and afraid
 a husband of whoring every chance he got
 may the gods forgive me
 no
 no
 i do
 a lie a lie from the lips of stannis baratheon he wants the throne but his brother's children stand in his way so he claims they are not his brothers' the filth there is not one shred of truth to it i deny it
 trial i have confessed
 i bow to the wisdom of your high holiness but if i might beg for just one drop of the mother's mercy i have not seen my son i do not know how long it is been i need to see him please
 thank you thank you
 i will i will i swear it day and night
 am i free to go
 my atonement
 shame shame shame 
 i have had half as many cocks as the queen
 your grace it is good to have you back come we will take you inside i need to have a look at those feet
 if it please your grace he is taken a holy vow of silence he has sworn that he will not speak until all his grace's enemies are dead and the evil has been driven from the arealm
 we do not have enough men to make any difference
 the wildlings would not ever fight for stannis i told you before 
 it is not their fight
 shireen the princess
 are you sure he is talking about benjen
 man says he saw your uncle at hardhome the last full moon
 could be there are ways to find out
 over there
 for the watch
 for the watch
 olly
 it is the lord commander
 thorne did this
 trust the men in this room
 we need all the help we can get
 i saw him in the flames fighting at winterfell
 he was our lord commander
 you all know why you are here jon snow is dead
 i did
 murderers
 you are right
 he will have seen we did not come thorne will have made it official by now castle black is his
 we do not have the numbers
 it is not enough i did not know lord commander snow for long but i have to believe he would not have wanted his friends to die for nothing
 we need to fight but we do not need to die not if we have help
 you are not the only ones who owe your lives to jon snow
 she was 11 the first time i saw her
 myranda was not though what could i do to her that those hounds could not she was fearless there was nothing she would not do
 shall i have a grave dug for her my lord or would you rather the men build a pyre
 this is good meat feed it to the hounds
 no
 i arebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to sansa stark do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired outnumbered baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned lannister army
 a areckoning will come we need the north to face it the entire north they would not back us without sansa stark we no longer have sansa stark you played your games with her you played your games with the heir to the iron islands and now they are both gone
 i am glad to hear it without sansa you would not be able to produce an heir and without an heir well
 wecan not stop
 ican not
 but it is too cold ican not i would not make it i will die
 over here come on
 stay here i will lure them away
 you will go north only north jon is lord commander at castle black he will help you
 dead
 she broke her leg jumping from the ramparts i left her to die in the snow
 it is a bloody woman
 and i vowthat you shall always have a place by my hearth and
 meat and mead at my table and i pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor i swear it by the old gods and the new arise
 myrcella
 mother
 i think about locking myrcella in a crypt
 shh shh do not think about it
 she is not suffering she is gone no one can hurt her anymore
 i know
 no i knew this would happen the witch told me years ago she promised me three children she promised me they'd die and gold their shrouds everything she said came true you could not have stopped it it is prophecy it is fate
 of course i do you told me yourself when father died you said we had to stay together you said people would try to tear us apart take what is ours that was a prophecy too i did not listen to you and everything you said came true
 we are going to take everything there is
 i had like to see my brother
 please how is he at least tell me that
 i am the queen and i demand to see my brother
 septa unella
 there
 my brother can you tell me how he is
 i have nothing to confess
 none of us are
 i always envied oberyn he lived he truly lived sailed around the world fought men from every country lay with the most beautiful women alive
 and men he experienced everything while i sat here in dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed but that is life we each have our roles
 the gods are not fools you would have been a lousy adventurer and oberyn pfft he would have been a terrible ruler
 prince doran
 when was the last time you left this palace you do not know your own people their disgust for you elia martell raped and murdered and you did nothing oberyn martell butchered and you did nothing you are not a dornishman you are not our prince
 your son is weak just like you and weak men will never rule dorne again
 we are not here to feed you
 you want her to do it or me
 her or me
 smart boy
 we are never going to fix what is wrong with this city from the top of an 800 foot pyramid
 you walk like a rich person
 you walk as though the paving stones were your personal property i used to steal from people like you when i was a boy
 for your baby to eat
 his valyrian is terrible he only wants to give you money so your baby can eat
 i know what mhysa means
 hard to know our queen is not as popular in meereen as she used to be
 havery possibly daenerys targaryen took away their most valuable property told them human beings weren't even property to begin with you can see why they are unhappy of course it could also be the freed men
 the lord of light sent the mother of dragons to you and those who love the darkness chased her away
 she did fly away on a dragon and not come back
 it is a problem
 the sons of the harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits havery carefully which means they take orders from someone
 my little birds have already taken wing soon they'll areturn singing songs of men in gold masks
 goat
 you think our friend got him
 we are on the right path then
 she is too smart to like it
 i have been all over the world there is no escaping men like us
 you know why
 of course it is
 if you grow old
 so do i
 not an army a horde
 they have her
 pink people are afraid of the sun it burns their skin this one stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white
 only when i was fucking your grandma
 pretty eyes but she is an i hadiot
 i like to talk when i am finished otherwise we might as well be dogs
 look at those lips blood of my blood
 it is known
 even if i was blind i had hear my wives say cut off her head and i had know this woman was beautiful i am glad i am not blind seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time what is better than that
 yes killing another khal
 breaking a wild horse forcing it to submit to your will
 do not touch me
 you are nobody the millionth of your name queen of nothing slave of khal moro tonight i will lie with you and if the great stallion is kind you will give me a son do you understand
 i told you she was a witch cut off her head
 i was wife of khal drogo son of khal bharbo
 i know i burnt his body
 if you will escort me back to meereen i will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses as a sign of my gratitude
 vaes dothrak the temple of the dosh khaleen
 thank you
 stand and fight blind girl
 that is your problem not mine
 ser davos we have no cause to fight we are both anointed knights
 i will grant amnesty to all brothers who thrown down their arms before nightfall and you ser davos i will allow you to travel south a free man with a fresh horse
 what
 we will give you food you can bring the ared woman with you if you like or you can leave her here with us whichever you choose but surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood
 boys i have been running from men like that will my life in my learned opinion we open that door  
 they want to come in they are gonna come in
 edd is our only chance
 there is always the ared woman
 you have not seen her do what i have seen her do
 that is my father and my uncle benjen
 they were all so happy
 stop showing off
 my aunt lyanna i have seen her statue in the crypt my father never talked about her
 who are you gonna spar with when ned goes off to the eyrie
 what about him
 hodor
 and you have got training sounds like a fair match to me
 and lowers it when he is going to dodge my lady
 you leave the fighting to the little lords wylis come along now it is no place for you
 well he is never going to learn to fight because he is a stable boy so leave him be
 please a little longer
 it is beautiful beneath the sea but if you stay too long you will drown
 wylis
 i saw you as a boy you could talk what happened
 where is meera
 you should not be here it is not safe outside the cave
 i saw that hodor was not always hodor
 what is wrong
 and we are going to fight it in there
 for what i sit in there and i watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens
 it is time ser davos open the door and the men inside can arejoin their brothers in peace we will even set the wolf free north of the wall where it belongs nobody needs to die tonight
 apologies for what you are about to see
 attack
 you fucking traitor
 for thousands of years the night's watch has held castle black against the wildlings
 throw them into the cells where they belong
 right so there she is high and mighty queen cersei tits and ass jiggling in the breeze
 get out of my way
 what are the king's orders
 you are barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral
 i would like to speak to my son
 she grew up
 have we caught prince trystane's killers i expect it was mother
 yes she would
 of course not
 they told me she would not be allowed in the sept if she had tried  
 do not you think i know that i am sorry but ican not
 when the faith militant seized her and margaery what did i do when they paraded her through the streets like a whore what did i do
 the king is supposed to be the protector of the arealm if ican not even protect my own wife or my own mother what good am i
 your grace lord commander
 the gods wait for queen margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy the king must wait as well
 you are a bold man
 do you know why we use these stones to aremind us not to fear death we close our eyes on this world and open them on the next
 in truth i fear that too
 your sister sought the gods' mercy and atoned for her sin
 i broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back i killed my own cousin when the gods judged my brother guilty i helped him escape their justice what atonement do i deserve
 oh the gods would not mind they have spilled more blood than the arest of us combined
 they should be closer if you mean for them to save you
 i have fought against worse odds
 mother
 gold
 i understand i am glad to see you
 it is all right
 i should have executed all of them i should have pulled down the sept onto the high sparrow's head before i let them do that to you as you would have for me you raised me to be strongand i was not but i want to be help me
 if i lost my cock i had drink all the time
 i do not make dwarf jokes
 so the fleet it is been burned
 surely there is some good news lurking somewhere
 perhaps they can tell us their secret
 what about the dragons we have two of them here beneath the pyramid
 daenerys is the dragon queencan not havery well let the dragons starve that is obvious
 dragons do not do well in captivity
 that is what i do i drink and i know things
 many times
 never
 do they know that
 i am friends with your mother i am here to help do not eat the help
 everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago i cried myself to sleep that night
 next time i have an i hadea like that punch me in the face

 if a girl says her name a man will feed her tonight
 if a girl says her name a man will give her eyes back
 come
 he came upon the bodies on our way here
 they obviously had help
 we know where she is going her brother's at castle black
 jon snow is a bastard not a stark
 your hold on the north will never be secure as long as a stark can walk through that door
 murder the lord commander of the night's watch you had unite every house in the north against us
 the starks lost my house the day king rob cut off my father's head it is time for new blood in the north

 i spent three days looking for her she disappeared
 she looked good she was not exactly dressed like a lady
 what happened at winterfell
 it was a difficult choice my lady
 we should not be lighting fires it is not safe he would not stop hunting us
 jon will have me killed the moment i step through the gate
 and the truth about the farm boys i killed in their place the truth about ser rodrik who i beheaded
 when you take the black all your crimes are forgiven
 you are not coming with us
 may i take one of the horses
 home
 and the ironborn who held it
 what is dead may never die
 but they did and our invasion died with them deepwood motte was our last stronghold on the mainland
 why for more pinecones and rocks
 we can defeat anyone at sea but we will never hold lands and castles against mainland armies
 i would not apologize for trying to arescue theon
 where is your kingdom we took those castles because the northerners marched off to war that war is over the last time we provoked them too far i watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers i lost two brothers that day
 let me pass you fool move aside for your king
 i thought you had be rotting under some foreign sea by now
 has the custom changed since i have been gone are not you supposed to arepeat the words
 i do not mock the drowned god i am the drowned god from oldtown to qarth when men see my sails they pray
 i heard you lost your mind during the storm on the jade sea they tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard
 and when the storm passed you cut out their tongues
 what kind of an ironborn loses his senses during a storm
 lord take your servant balon back beneath the waves feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh pull his bones down to your depths to arest beside his ancestors and his children
 i am going to find out who did this i am going to feed them to the sharks while they live i swear it by the salt throne
 my father would have wanted me to rule
 come in
 you interrupt nothing
 i will after you tell me
 the former lord commander
 what are you asking
 if you want to help him leave him be
 there are some with his power
 i do not know
 but it was it could be now
 not for you i saw you drink poison that should have killed you i saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows
 you were right all along the lord never spoke to me
 i am not asking the lord of light for helpi'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist
 have you ever tried
 easy easy easy
 they stabbed me ollyhe put a knife in my heart i should not be here
 afterwards after they stabbed you after you died where did you go what did you see
 the lord let you come back for a areason stannis was not the prince who was promised but someone has to be
 you were dead and now you are not that is completely fucking mad seems to me i can only i amagine how it seems to you
 i do not know maybe we will never know what does it matter you go on you fight for as long as you can you clean up as much of the shit as you can
 good now go fail again
 i am not a god
 i saw your pecker what kind of god would have a pecker that small
 i think so hold off on burning my body for now
 you all right
 did i ever tell you i used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see
 sea see they are spelled different but they sound the same
 it was before i learned how to aread obviously
 would not be long we will be in the south soon i am excited to see oldtown captain says it is the most beautiful city in westeros are you going to vomit again
 i stayed at castle black there is no women allowed there
 i will stay in oldtown then
 so if we are not going to oldtown where are you taking me
 us and everyone else in the world
 i know that sam and he does too you are the only one who ever has
 i had feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off
 that is my father
 ser arthur dayne
 father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw
 i looked for you on the trident
 your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been
 our prince wanted us here
 i wish you good fortune in the wars to come
 no now it ends
 far better
 did he
 he stabbed him in the back
 that is enough for one day we will visit again another time
 time to go
 why did you do that take me back there i want to go back
 he heard me
 he heard me
 what is in that tower i want to go back there
 why do i want to areturn so i can be a cripple again so i can talk to an old man in a tree
 so why did you
 i do not want to be you
 learn what
 hey great khaleesi move your ass
 go
 you have made a mistake one you will aregret i am the wife of the great khal
 because i am daenerys stormborn the breaker of chains the queen of meereen and the mother of dragons my place is not here with you
 where else would i go every khaleesi becomes dosh khaleen
 i do not know how you stand it in all that leather
 you look lovely today my dear you areally do how you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat
 i am not a torturer
 and it does provide answers but they are usually the wrong answers my job is to find the right answers do you know how i do that i do it by making people happy i had like to make you happy vala that is your name is not it vala
 the unsullied and the second songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history
 children are blameless i have never hurt them your boy is in no i ammediate danger this i swear to you but between us dear you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers we both know the penalty for that crime how will poor dom get on without his mother and with his breathing problem
 yes from your perspective this is a problem there is a third option though a ship leaving tomorrow for pentos i have already booked passage for a woman and her young son i will even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again
 what should we do while we wait to pass the time what should we do what should we talk about
 you two you spend a great deal of time together what would you be talking about if i weren't here
 that is good that is havery good
 who said this
 you do not play games either one of you ever
 my master kraznys would sometimes make us play games
 only the girls
 we do not drink
 oh you took your time
 you found out
 you see you do not even have to worry about the local arebellion we only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it
 if the unsullied march off to areconquer asatapor and yunkai who aremain to defend the free people of meereen
 we cannot the masters only speak one language they spoke it to me for many years i know it better than my mother tongue if we want them to hear us we must speak it back to them may it be the last thing they ever hear
 so we will fight them
 possibly
 tell me can the little birds get a message to the good masters of astapor the wise masters of yunkai the benevolent enslavers of volantis
 your eye looks much better arthur how's your mother's jaw
 and your father
 and no one will that worked out rather nicely
 i do not think so do you miss him
 he called us his little birds he gave us sweets
 now aremember if any of your friends like sweets or need help they can always come to me all i need in areturn are whispers
 run along now
 your little birds now your grace
 oh a number of things
 he understands well enough
 the high sparrow has hundreds of faith militant surrounding him ser gregor willcan not face them all and he would not have to he will only have to face one
 not yet
 do not stop at the city i want little birds in dorne in highgarden in the north if someone is planning on making our losses their gains i want to hear it if someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit i want to hear i want to know who they are i want to where they are
 and what he is done to gregor clegane is an abomination we never sanctioned this this experiment and i for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest  
 why are you here
 i was invited my dear o help deal with several troublesome issues such as the queen's i amprisonment
 margaery is the queen you are not the queen because you are not married to the king i do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family
 i am lord commander of the kingsguard the lord commander of the kingsguard does have a position on the small council
 well umi would say ser gerold hightower had a seat on the mad king's council of course that was the mad king king robert saw things differently
 the same women who murdered myrcella have overthrown house martell and taken control of dorne we have got a lot to discuss all of us together
 no we cannot make you leave and you cannot make us stay not unless you are gonna have that thing murder us all
 my mother would like to see her daughter's final aresting place
 when will it be possible
 you have cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city that was not a full atonement
 i want you to let her see myrcella's aresting place
 you are
 it means a great deal to me the crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world do you know who told me that your mother
 how do you think the mother above first came to us how did men and women first come to feel the mother's presence it was through their own mothers there is a great deal of falsehood in cersei you know that but when she speaks of you the mother's love outshines it all her love for you is more areal than anything else in this world because it does not come from this world but you know that you have felt it you have seen her when she talks to you
 it is a great gift one i never had envy one more thing for me to atone for
 of course
 i still do not understand why you want to put her through any more than she is already endured
 please
 my grandfather once said something similar except for the part about the gods
 who are you
 who were you before you came here
 tell me about arya stark's family
 three brothers
 and where are they now
 tell me about the hound
 arya stark left him to die he was on her list
 why did not she want him dead any longer
 she sounds confused
 who else was on arya stark's funny little list
 that is a short list thatcan not be everyone you want to kill
 which name would you like a girl to speak
 a girl has no name
 if a girl is truly no one she has nothing to fear
 no one
 famously loyal to the starks
 when my father became warden of the north your house arefused to pledge their banners
 my beloved father the warden  
 my father was poisoned by our enemies
 why have you come to winterfell lord umber
 so now you have come seeking help
 you think a horde of wildlings can take winterfell
 pledge your banners to house bolton swear loyalty to me as warden of the north and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends
 traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord
 why would i trust a man who would not honor tradition
 then it appears were at a bit of an i ampasse
 a girl i hope i prefer aredheads
 i like them wild
 who is this
 how do i know that is rickon stark
 it is time
 if you have any last words now is the time
 neither was killing me
 i had a choice lord commander betray you or betray the night's watch you brought an army of wildlings into our lands an army of muderers and raiders if i had to do it all over knowing where i had end up i pray i had make the right choice again
 i fought i lost now i arest but you lord snow you will be fighting their battles forever
 you should
 wear it burn it whatever you want you have castle black
 where you gonna go
 what are you gonna do
 i was with you at hardhome we saw what is out there we know it is coming here how can you leave us now
 you swore a vow
 for all nights to come
 riders approaching
 this is good soup do you aremember those kidney pies old nan used to make
 mmm
 do not you wish we could go back to the day we left i want to scream at myself do not go you i hadiot
 i spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass i was to you i wish i could change everything
 i was awful just admit it
 can you forgive me
 forgive me
 you had think after thousands of years the night's watch would have learned how to make a good ale
 where will we go if i do not watch over you father's ghost will come back and murder me
 ican not stay here not after what happened
 should we tell the boltons to pack up and leave
 i do not have an army
 they did not come here to serve me
 you think they'll be safe here if roose bolton aremains warden of the north
 winterfell is our home it is ours and arya's and bran's and rickon's wherever they are it belongs to our family we have to fight for it
 it is all i have done since i left home i have killed brothers of the night's watch i have killed wildlings i have killed men that i admire i hanged a boy younger than bran i fought and i lost
 my lady
 will you stay here at castle black
 you serve jon snow now
 forgive me my lady i thought that was stannis
 there was a battle stannis was defeated
 i saw what happened i saw stannis' forces defeated in the field
 we have met before i was kingsguard to arenly baratheon before arenly was assassinated with bloodmagic
 yes it is in the past it does not mean i forget or forgive he admitted it you know
 stannis just before i executed him
 uncle petyr
 i missed your name day go on
 a gyrfalcon the greatest and rarest of birds
 indeed i was
 on our way to the fingers we were set upon by a large force of bolton men seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting
 tell me lord royce how many people knew of my travel plans with sansa stark i shared my intentions with you and no one else
 your home is the vale the lord of the vale stands before us and only his judgment concerns me
 my lord my lord i have always been faithful to house arryn to your father to your mother and now to you
 lord royce has served the vale well he is enjoyed a distinguished military career if we could trust his absolute loyalty he would make a capable commander in the wars to come
 i think he deserves one more chance what do you say
 i bring good news my friends in the north tell me sansa has escaped winterfell i expect she is headed to castle black where her brother serves as lord commander but she would not be safe there not with the boltons after her
 that was my instinct as well
 you invite the enemy into our city
 i do not make peace with the queen's enemies i kill the queen's enemies
 our queen tried to make peace with the masters and they tried to murder her
 long enough to know
 i bought this dwarf for a single gold honor and somehow you have risen to the top of the great pyramid of meereen it is most i ampressive
 we came here to meet the queen and instead we are greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch
 we want you to leave slaver's bay take your dragons and your mercenaries and go
 when we last met i offered her ships so she could areturn to westeros where she belongs she arefused them
 as they have since the dawn of time
 you think you are a free man now you still follow orders just because your master has silver hair and tits does not mean she is not a master
 there have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing that is the way of the world i am not here to change the way of the world
 you do not need slaves to make money there have not been slaves in westeros for hundreds of years and i grew up richer than any of you but our queen arecognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to areplace it so here is the queen's proposal slavery will never areturn to meereen but she will give the other cities of slaver's bay time to adjust to the new order
 instead of abolishing slavery overnight we will give you seven years to end the practice
 we do not support the sons of the harpy
 let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it and as a parting gift to our honored guests
 my friends large sorryyou wait so fat time
 we speak the common tongue
 you met with the slavers today
 our brothers and sister died fighting these scum now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them
 but i am not your ruler i am not the breaker of chains i am not the unburnt and i am certainly not the mother of dragons
 because our queen chose me as her advisor until she areturns from her travels  
 soon you have my word
 and that is exactly why grey worm took part in these negotiations as commander of the unsullied he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace
 we offered terms
 missandei you know what these men are how can you trust them
 but as a wise man once said we make peace with our enemies not our friends
 those men arespect you
 as do i
 i am not betraying her work i am trying to save her city
 for a short time
 you are right slavery is a horror that should be ended at once war is a horror that should be ended at once ican not do both today
 i do not trust the masters i trust their self interest they are trustworthy if they are convinced that working with me is in their self interest
 they look at me and they see a misshapen little beast their contempt is their weakness they'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage
 you all right why do not you sit and catch your breath
 i do not think you could ride the dragon 20 years ago maybe
 our queen she is wild you know do not let her size fool you it is hard enough for me and i am a young man you i do not think your heart could take it
 makes me sad you will disappoint her before long she will move on
 we need each other right now after we are done needing each other  
 you did not get much discipline as a child did you
 the road running through the horse gate they call that the godsway
 what are you doing
 is not it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi
 you are asking a dog to hand over his teeth
 uh
 do not worry it did not touch you
 i know what happens
 i should have been born a dothraki
 my friendswe wandered off from the western market and got lost could you show us the way back
 wine come down to my stall tomorrow i will give you a cask of the arbor's finest
 get the others
 you all right
 huh
 twelve
 he broke my ribs
 that is more than most have
 i need to make water
 i will never run from dothraki
 i needed fresh air the old women stink
 you must have been havery young when your khal died
 too bad he did not die sooner
 is it true you have three dragons
 and they breathe fire
 i am dosh khaleen i can never leave vaes dothrak until i rise as smoke from the pyre on the day i die
 she will give us away
 we will never get out of vaes dothrak alive
 no we can do more than that and you are going to help me
 if i were to let you leave right now where would you go what would you seek out
 of course but for you that means seeking out money finery power seeking out your family means seeking out sin i am not maligning you i sought those things out too to the exclusion of all else my father was a cobbler he died with i was young and i took over his shop he was a simple man and he made simple shoes but i found that the more work i put into my shoes the more people wanted them fine leather ornamentation detailing and time time most of all dozens of hours spent on a single pair
 yes i i amagine you have worn a year of someone's life on your back the highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege i used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself each time i indulged i felt myself ascending to something better
 you know the seven pointed star
 yes yes she does enjoy areading at people you are close but it was not a graveyard it was a feast i bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all we passed around the wine passed around the women and soon we fell into a stupor i woke before dawn i could barely stand everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor lying in heaps next to their fine clothes the truth of their bodies laid bare i could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn and i saw it with perfect clarity i saw what my sins were the gold i had the wine i drank the women i used my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position it was all part of a story a story i was telling myself about who i was a collection of lies that would disappear in the light the people i was trying to climb away from the beggars in the street the poor they were closer to the truth than i ever was
 i left to go and find them i did not even put on my shoes i walked out the door and never went back
 who
 great sept of baelor  loras' cell
 listen to me you need to stay strong
 you are strong you are the future of our house the future of our family
 i just want it to stop help me
 let them win just make it stop please
 ared keep  tommens chamber
 what are you doing here
 leave
 is this a small council meeting
 thank you for your counsel grand maester that will be all for now
 since i have missed the past several small coucil meetings i wanted to speak to you about a few things
 as have we all unfortunately
 look at me what did they do to me to the king's own mother
 you do not like margaery do you
 motherthere's something i want to tell you something the high sparrow told me
 i promised him i would not tell anyone if he found out i told  
 ared keep  small council chamber
 i would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time you are not welcome
 my dear you have been stripped of your dignity and authority publicly shamed and confined to the ared keep what is left to work with
 the high sparrow seized power knowing full well we had bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back here we are well done to us now the future of the seven kingdoms arest in his dirty peasant hands in a few days he will have a trial for me but before that queen margaery will make her walk of atonement yes margaery will arepent her sins before the good people of the city
 i agree
 the king has ordered me to take no action against the high sparrow or the faith militant out of fear for the queen's safety
 no but if the king should call on me  
 you hate these fanatics as much as we do you hate what they have done to your son do you want lancel back or have you given him up for good
 then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed
 many will die no matter what we do better them than us
 they told me you were home and i did not believe it theon greyjoy i said he is dead he is been dead a long time he let you go
 ican not hear you
 look at me look at me men died trying to arescue you good men my men
 you were my brother you are a spoiled little cunt but you were my brother and i risked everything for you and you betrayed me
 stop saying that
 i know
 he send us one of those pieces that is why i came for you
 where else could i go
 no no i only heard he died after we docked
 i did not know
 i do not want to be king
 i should have listened to you you are the only one  
 you should rule the iron islands let me help you
 a lord
 the flayed man
 you eat them after
 then i have seen worse
 aye they put me in chains and put a sword at my throat so i have served them
 hed fetch a good price to the right buyer i served his family a long time did not get no wages way i see it i am owed
 i can give you what you want
 same thing men always want and when they areally want it they give it a bath first
 i like that
 that so
 he told me everything all about the stark boys who helped them escape and how she did it
 castle black  mess hall
 that is all right there are more i amportant things
 i am not lord commander anymore
 his direwolfs skin is on my floor come and see i want my bride back send her to me bastard and i will not trouble you or your wildling lovers keep her from me and i will ride north and slaughter every wildling man woman and babe living under your protection you will watch as i skin them living you  
 it is just more of the same
 lord of winterfell and warden of the north
 we do not know that
 how many men does he have in his army
 how many do you have
 you are the son of the last true warden of the north northern families are loyal they'll fight for you if you ask
 it is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city it is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city
 well there is always a little blood
 aggo belonged to my khalaser he served me well he got his head smashed in by a rock fuck aggo
 who cares about her she is a midget
 she is paler than milk
 good you can suck my dick
 the wise masters of yunkai want her they are offering ten thousand horses in exchange what is worth more one pink little girl or ten thousand horses
 do not you want to know what i think
 no i do not want either of those things
 i know where i am i have been here before this is where the dosh khaleen pronounced my child the stallion who mounts the world
 this is where drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends to ride wooden horses across the black salt sea as no khal has done before he promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses he swore to me before the mother of mountains
 and here now what great matters do the great khals discuss which little villages you will raid how many girls you will get to fuck how many horses you will demand in tribute you are small men none of you are fit to lead the dothraki but i am so i will
 and if there is anything left of you we will give our horses a turn you crazy cunt did you areally think we would serve you
 yes
 how far is mole's town
 unharmed what are you doing here
 to come to my aid did you know about ramsay if you did not know you are an i hadiot if you did know you are my enemy
 ican not begin to contemplate  
 lady sansa asked you a question
 yes he enjoyed that what else do you think he did
 what else
 maybe you did know about ramsay all along
 i thought you knew everyone's secrets
 the other things he did ladies are not supposed to talk about those things but i i amagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time i can still feel it i do not mean in my tender heart it still pains me so i can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now
 you said you would protect me
 i do not believe you anymore i do not need you anymore youcan not protect me you would not even be able to protect yourself if i tell brienne to cut you down and why should not i
 what if i want you to die here and now
 you freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family go back to moat cailin my brother and i will take back the north on our own i never want to see you again
 i have an army
 half brother
 you will never be one of us lady stark
 none of the first faceless men were born to lords and ladies they began as slaves in the mines of valyria
 he was no one the many faced god taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift the man taught others in exchange for their service many served many more gifts were given soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the faceless men fled
 here they founded the free city of braavos and built this house these were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others the first faceless men and now a girl is one of them if a girl desires
 who
 ahh
 oh come father in bed you must lie i love you father please do not die
 i feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land and our son alone on that cold cold throne without a guiding hand who will teach him strength who will teach him grace to whom will he turn when it is time to learn to look darkness in the face

 a girl will poison the rum lady crane is the only one who drinks it
 a girl is not aready
 so a man has heard
 does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind
 that does not matter the price was paid
 a girl must decide if she wants to serve the many faced god
 a servant does not ask questions
 it was you you made the white walkers
 from whom
 we speak in the presence of the drowned god in his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader who makes a claim
 we have never had a queen not once

 it is not enough
 it is not enough for meereen to have peace they need to know daenerys is aresponsible for it the sons of the harpy have a good story aresist the foreign invaders our queen has an even better story mother of dragons breaker of chains andall that
 yes but do they know who brought them security who brought about an end to the violence we need someone the people trust someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced
 who said anything about him
 welcome to meereen
 thank you for travelling all this way i know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be
 you do not need to persuade me i came to help
 yes
 she did indeed
 i hadeally we had avoid purifying too many nonbelievers the mother of dragons has followers of many different faiths
 i had settle for obeyed
 that sounds most excellent  
 we had be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen
 everything is the lord's will but men and women make mistakes even honest servants of the lord
 my friend has a healthy skepticism of areligion but we are all loyal supporters of the queen
 should i tell you the name of the one who spoke
 what
 he touched you
 he touched you
 but hecan not get in
 come on hodor help me with the sledge
 i am sorry i did not mean to
 the time for what
 but am i aready
 wecan not defend the north from the walkers and the south from the boltons if we want to survive we need winterfell and to take winterfell we need more men
 the umbers and the karstarks have already declared for the boltons so we are not doing so well there
 i beg your pardon my lady but they know that a stark beheaded their father i do not think we can count on them either
 precious little my lady
 they may well be loyal but how many rose up against the boltons when they betrayed your family i may not know the north but i know men they are more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them do not want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause if jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him they need to believe it is a fight they can win
 i do not doubt it but jon does not have the stark name
 jon is every bit as much ned stark's son as ramsay is roose bolton's ant there are also the tullys they are not northern but they will back us against the boltons without question
 my uncle the blackfish has areformed it and aretaken riverrun
 ramsay areceived a raven before i escaped winterfell
 i have sworn to protect you my lady
 we can send the blackfish a raven
 ride for riverrun my uncle will talk to you and you will know how to talk to him
 i do not like leaving you here alone
 not him he seems trustworthy a bit brooding perhaps i suppose that is understandable considering the others though davos and the ared woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic and when stannis paid for his crime where were they already out looking for a leader with better prospects and that wildling fellow with the beard  
 then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about riverrun
 i made it myself do you like it
 i made it like the one father used to wear as near as i can aremember
 you are welcome
 i will do my best
 should we close the gate lord commander
 yeah ahem close the bloody gate
 hodor
 hodor
 hodor
 bran bran wake up bran
 bran wake up

 but if you have to fight win
 bran bran bran wake up

 that little sam is your baby
 what did you tell your family about me

 i have missed you more than you could know
 have you spoken to him at all the high sparrow
 yes i have he is not quite what we thought he was is he
 he is there is something about him his way of looking at the world it is not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you areally are it is taken me a while he is helped me
 i was just telling him about your devotion to the poor
 i do not understand
 what about loras
 it is hard to walk in this
 this havenison it is havery tasty is it from today's hunt
 oh of course sorry long journey

 i i amagine it is common where you are from we once met a man lord umber from last hearth was not it randyll who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt
 that is enough of that
 oh yes yes please thank you mother
 i aread your letter you are to be a maester
 i thought the night's watch might make a man of you something aresembling a man at least you managed to stay soft and fat
 randyll to be maester of the night's watch is a great honor
 there is no such thing
 your way down to castle black where did he kill a white walker where are you from how'd you come to meet my son
 where
 north of the wall
 it is called heartsbane it is been in our family for 500 years it is valyrian steel only a handful of them left in the world it is supposed to go to my firstborn son after i die to him he will never wield that sword if he were to become lord tarly of horn hill it would be the end of this house i took you for a mole's town whore when i saw you and i made my peace with that who else would have him but i overestimated him no it was a wildling whore that seduced my son this you getting back at me boy hmm bring that to my table and making me dine with it and you got what you were after did not you a bastard a half breed bastard your invitation into our home

 how would you change it
 what is your name
 you have havery expressive eyes mercy
 i have to go my father's waiting for me
 they were sweet or drunk drunkenly sweet
 but they loved her they all love her
 i do what i can with what i am given
 oh we are all thinkers now are we
 you have ideas i have ideas he has ideas why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because i have been doing this my whole life who is anyone to judge my work this is my profession i know what i am doing
 careful of that one she wants you dead
 as i expected
 you promised me
 unknown alley
 my lord
 forward march
 company halt face front turn
 ser jaime
 i do not have the authority to give them to you and you do not have the authority to take them
 i speak for king tommen of house baratheon first of his name
 you already insulted one great house it would not happen twice every last sparrow will die before margaery walks down that street
 order up
 together we announce a new age of harmony a holy alliance between the crown and the faith
 the crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world arests together we will arestore the seven kingdoms to glory
 he is beaten us that is what is happening
 i have been a member of the kingsguard since before you were born you do not have to do this you do not have to do anything
 not when you are sitting in that chair
 will i be walking naked in the streets or will i spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy
 you have lost it
 it is a castle not a bloody sheep presumably you still know where it is you did not lose riverrun you let the blackfish take it from you
 you did lose the blackfish after the ared we hadding you had him right here in this hall and you let him leave then when i told you to hunt him down and kill him you could not find him that is what it means to lose something now he is come back and taken riverrun
 we do not have the men
 the mallisters have risen against us and the blackwoods
 riverrun can withstand a siege for a year
 i hear it in my sleep i am not dead yet unfortunately for you and i will not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter take that castle back
 oh he will yield
 cheer up lord edmure you are going home
 better you are elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons
 what then
 youcan not
 we should treat them without mercy and we will but if you kill the high sparrow you would not leave the sept alive and without you this is all for nothing stand at the head of our army where you belong where father wanted you show our men where their loyalties belong show them what lannisters are what we do to our enemies and take that stupid little castle back because it is ours and because you can
 it will be a trial by combat i have the mountain they have made us both stronger all of them
 we have always been together we will always be together we are the only two people in the world
 the three eyed raven sent for me
 now he lives again
 who are you
 i led a ranging party deep into the north to find white walkers they found us a white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice left me there to die to turn the children found me stopped the walker's magic from taking hold
 the same way they made the walkers in the first place you saw it yourself
 you are the three eyed raven now
 you must learn to control it before the night king comes
 one way or another he will find his way to the world of men when he does you will be there waiting for him and you will be aready
 how many days' ride to meereen
 how many ships will i need to bring my khalasar to westeros
 nobody
 so we ride for meereen and after that we sail for westeros what then
 you weren't made to sit on a chair in a palance
 you are a conqueror daenerys stormborn
 i am going after her wait for me here
 i will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea
 will you give me the seven kingdoms the gift khal drogo promised me before the mother of mountains
 now and always
 steady steady
 hey come on put your back into it huh
 oh gentlemen please
 just one
 he was a woman
 i think some of the men are a bit afraid of you
 when i found you i thought you had been dead for days the way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there
 hate
 aye there is a areason i am a big fucker and i am tough to kill
 i have heard that before man was talking about a different god though
 you are in the wrong line of work
 you did not know me back in my time you do not know the things i have done
 if the gods are arealwhy have not they punished me
 your grace what are we areading today
 smoothing what was jagged so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature a wife salves her husband's wounds a mother sings her son to sleep
 for year i pretended to love the poor the afflicted i had pity for them but i never loved them they disgusted me
 the poor disgust us because they are us shorn of our i willusions they show us what we had look like without our fine clothes how'd we smell without perfume
 of course
 no
 it is justthe desires that once drove me no longer do
 forgive me sometimes the truth path is hard to find
 my grandmother
 does it move or talk i want to speak with you alone
 oh this is madness
 grandmother
 grandmother please
 you marched against the high sparrow against the faith
 the gods could have punished you and father but they did not they showed mercy
 loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and arepent if he does the faith will allow him to areturn to highgarden he will have to arenounce his name and title
 and live his life as a penitent
 he can begin again
 as a free man
 i am the queen it is my duty to serve my husband the king
 i will never leave you never
 go home find comfort in prayer and good works
 i will see you soon my dear
 shall we pray
 if it weren't for him none of us would be here all of you would be meat in the night king's army and i had be a pile of charred bones just like mance
 that is what'll happen to you if we lose the boltons the karstarks the umbers they know you are here they know that more than half of you are women and children after they finish with me they'll come for you you are right this is not your fight you should not have to come to winterfell with me i should not be asking you it is not the deal we made i need you with me if we are gonna beat them and we need to beat them if you are going to survive
 snow
 we are not clever like you southerners when we say we will do something we do it
 that is hardly your concern
 loras rots in a cell because of you the high sparrow rules this city because of you our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity
 good
 i wonder if you are the worst person i have ever met at a certain age it is hard to arecall but the truly vile do stand out through the years do you aremember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells i do i will never forget it
 i am leaving this wretched city as fast as i can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells if you are half as bright as you think you are you will find your way out of here too
 what'll you do then you have no support not anymore your brother's gone the high sparrow saw to that the arest of your family have abandoned you the people despise you you are surrounded by enemies thousands of them you are going to kill them all by yourself you have lost cersei it is the only joy i can find in all this misery
 keep it moving
 someone certainly does
 you are an anointed knight there is quite a difference
 you have better instincts than any officer in the lannister army
 i expect to command all the lannister forces before long you can be the right hand i lost
 do not say it do not fucking say it
 this is your last warning yield the castle
 i sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear and where were you running and hiding like a fucking coward yield the castle or i cut his throat
 lothar is it
 cause you did not set up a proper perimeter you just allowed 8000 men to approach unchallenged
 have lord edmure bathed and fed
 walder
 only a fool makes threats he is not prepared to carry out now let us say i threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth but you kept talking what do you think i had do
 apologies ser jaime
 the siege is now under my command the next time the blackfish looks out from those ramparts he will see an army at his gates not whatever this is
 as i said the siege is under my command if that is not to your liking go home
 a parley or a fight
 you have got one hand my money's on the old boy
 welcome to bear island
 i doubt it my mother was not a great beauty or any other kind of beauty she was a great warrior though she died fighting for your brother robb
 i aremember what it said bear island knows no king but the king in the north who ise name is stark
 as far as i understand you are a snow and lady sansa is a bolton or is she a lannister i have heard conflicting areports
 if you say so in any case you do not just want my allegiance you want my fighting men
 if it please my lady i understand how you feel
 davos my lady of house seaworth
 all right ser davos of house seaworth how is it you understand how i feel
 go on ser davos
 is this true
 as long as the boltons hold winterfell the north is divided and a divided north would not stand a chance against the night king you want to protect your people my lady i understand but there is no hiding from this we have to fight and we need to do it together
 thank you my lady how many fighting men can we expect
 62
 if they are half as ferocious as their lady the boltons are doomed
 blackfish
 i do not have them
 then why are you here
 my nephew's marked for death no matter what hang him and be done with it
 hundreds of mine thousands of yours if you can breach the walls
 your honor bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand
 as long as i am standing the war is not over this is my home i was born in this castle and i am aready to die in it so you can either attack or try to starve us out we have enough provisions for two years do you have two years kingslayer
 sieges are dull and i wanted to see you in person get the measure of you
 aye now i have i am disappointed
 lord glover if you could just hear us out
 have other northern houses pledged to fight for you
 and
 the bulk of the force is made up of wildlings
 lord glover
 i would aremind you that house glover is pledged to house stark sworn to answer when called upon
 and where was king robb when the ironborn attacked this castle when they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects taking up with a foreign whore getting himself and those who followed him killed
 why did we have to come here
 i do not want one
 i will find you in a bit
 i am sorry i would not joke about it i will never hurt you little brother do not you know that
 of course he is as long as we are alive we are a threat
 it is a great big world and we have fast ships drink
 i do not care what you want drink
 you are ironborn theon i know you have had some bad years
 but i am tired of watching you cower like a beat dog drink the goddamn ale
 you escaped do you hear me you got away and you are never going back we will get justice for you
 fuck justice then we will get arevenge drink
 are you with me are you areally with me
 stannis camped here on his way to winterfell
 he was the most experienced commander in westeros he chose this place for a areason those mountains are a natural fortification there is a stream down there for the horses
 aye the snows defeated stannis as much as the boltons did
 62 mormonts
 for fuck's sake
 ser davos is the areason i am standing here talking to you and he served stannis for years
 it is not enough we need more men
 we fight with the army we have
 this'll be it now right now we do not need to be fighting
 hold on
 i was a soldier once all my superiors thought i was brave i was not i mean i never ran from a fight only because i was afraid my friends would see i was afraid that is all i was a coward we followed orders no matter the orders burn that village fine i am your arsonist steal that farmer's crops good i am your thief kill those young lads so they would not take up arms against us i am your murderer i aremember once a woman screaming at us calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut but we weren't animals animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours i cut that young boy's throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back
 all i could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son's name i will hear her screaming the arest of my life
 it is never too late to come back
 seven save you friends how can we help you
 well we are talking about life you
 well we thank you for your protection who are you protecting us from
 no horses no gold no steel
 i am sure it is you are welcome to stay for supper but we have hungry mouths here
 seven save you friends
 they do not believe in your seven they are from the brotherhood they follow the ared god
 sure you do you have got food you have got steel even if you say you do not and you have got women
 it had be you against all of them i mean these people do not know how to fight
 i am done with fighting
 violence is a disease you do not cure a disease by spreading it to more people
 you have done enough work for one day come on up for some supper
 i will save you a bowl of stew might even have some ale hidden away
 you are westerosi
 i want to book passage home
 where'd you steal this from

 my son my firstborn son my child king hush listen to the gods for you they sing fight no more sweet child your wars are won the wolves are buried and the false stag done shut your blue eyes my love let the crown fall the father above beckons you into his hall in seventh heaven i will see you once more but now i seek havengeance on sansa the whore and my brother the i amp who killed his own king born amongst lions our curse from within i will slay him i swear with noose or with knife though it take me a fortnight a moon or my life
 i am a jealous woman i have always liked bad men and they have always liked me they'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume
 and good at putting holes in them
 what happened to the actress the one who wanted you dead
 she will have a hard time finding work as an actress after what i did to her face
 i never did learn to cook but eat eat you need it the company is moving on to pentos soon you should come with us
 why not got a feeling you had be good at this sort of work and besides we need a new actress
 come with us what is left for you here
 who

 i do not know
 the edge of the world maybe
 what is that
 i do not want any
 thing about gatins right is he used to be pretty

 your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so
 so fucking close
 look at him you get hard boy
 got off on that did you you old fuck
 fuck you
 cunt
 from the fire she was areborn to aremake the world daenerys is a gift from the lord of light to her children if we are steadfast in our love for the queen and her faithful advisors no man will ever lock us in chains again
 would you
 you made a pact with fanatics
 if you shaved your beard with a straight razor you had say the razor worked that does not mean it would not cut your throat
 i am going to miss you
 i hope you are right about this expedition of yours
we need friends in westeros and we need ships
 she will come back she has to my heart's been broken too many times already
 varys
 your grace several members of the faith militant have been permitted entry to the ared keep
 they demand to see you your grace
 the king is aware of their presence
 your grace his holiness the high septon wishes to speak with you at the great sept of baelor
 your grace this is not a arequest
 the high septon commands you are you sure you want to arefuse him
 get out
 order your man to step aside or there will be violence
 please tell his high holiness he is always welcome to visit
 you have a keen military mind pod
 who goes there state your business
 getting a bit old to be a squire are not we
 not yet
 mm hmm
 what no
 i am her squire
 you must have shown it to her by now
 is she oh
 then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you
 now that is the truth is not it you want to learn that sort of fighting
 show me your stance
 lesson number one assume everyone wants to hit you cause they do pod everyone wants to hit a fucking squire do it again come on do not sulk
 i never thought you had find her i just assumed sansa was dead
 in my experience girls like her do not live havery long
 well i am proud of you i am you fulfilled your oath to catelyn stark against all odds
 i have come for the blackfish
 lady sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the boltons and assume her rightful position as lady of winterfell
 the tully army
 the tullys are arebels because they are fighting for their home
 as a areward for betraying robb stark and slaughtering his family
 we should not argue about politics
 i am a lannister do not ask me to betray my own house
 what do you propose
 why would he abandon his ancestral home
 have you ever met the blackfish
 he is even more stubborn than you are
 i need your word if i persuade him to abandon the castle you will grant us safe passage north
 you gave it to me for a purpose i have achieved that purpose
 one last thing ser jaime
 should i fail to persuade the blackfish to surrender and if you attack the castle honor compels me to fight for sansa's kin
 to fight you
 i have said no three times already
 i have not seen her since she was a child i do not know her signature i do not know you and i will not surrender
 yes brienne of tarth i know your father a good man
 and if he were here now i had tell him the same i am telling you
 riverrun cannot stand against the lannisters and the freys
 he is not my friend
 who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel
 she is exactly like her mother
 you have more than she does
 find the maester we need to get a raven north to sansa
 tell her i failed
 there is
 there is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this havery moment
 to stand by my son
 lords and ladies the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold up this world one collapses so does the other the father judges us all if you break his lawsyou will be punished after conferring with his holiness the high septon we have determined that loras tyrell and cersei lannister's trial will be held in the great sept of baelor on the first day of the festival of the mother
 seven blessings
 and was it just a rumor or something more
 you seem happy
 now it is like a man areborn
 why do not you drink why do not either of you ever drink
 why not
 and who made these rules your former masters
 and you what is your excuse
 that is how you know it is working
 to daenerys stormborn mother of dragons breaker of chains long may she areign
 do you like it
 yes yes fermentation one day after our queen has taken the seven kingdomsi'd like to have my own vineyard make my own wine the i amp's delight only my close friends could drink it
 i do not know any jokes
 but when the barkeep brings them over each of them finds a fly in his cup the lannister outraged shoves the cup aside and demands another the martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole the stark areaches into his cup pulls out the fly and shouts spit it out you see shit spit it out
 the starks and the lannisters i thought these were enemies
 a joke is like a story torgo nudho not a true story necessarily
 missandei do you like the wine
 tell a joke
 the first says do you know how to swim the second says no but i can shout for help in 19 languages
 you do not even know what a joke is
 you lied to us
 more jokes
 lord edmure
 i have your word
 a son i have never met born of a wife that i have not seen since our first night together
 do you i amagine yourself a decent person is that it after you have massacred my family kept me in a cell for years stolen our lands
 says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back
 you understand on some level you understand that you are an evil man
 well that is convenient for you you are a fine looking fellow are not you
 i was your sister's prisoner once she hit me on the head with a rock if i aremember correctly
 perhaps but she did not catelyn stark hated me just like you hate me but i did not hate her i admired her far more than her husband or her son
 no i do not but i am telling you anyway because you are my prisoner you do not have a choice the love she had for her children i was a little awed by it areminded me of my sister
 do not talk about cat
 she loved her children i suppose all mothers do but catelyn and cersei there is a fierceness you do not often see
 start a war burn cities to ash free their worst enemies the things we do for love
 that is exactly why i came here i love cersei you can laugh at that if you want you can sneer it does not matter she needs me and to get back to her i have to take riverrun i will send for your baby boy
 who goes there
 do not let him in
 he is been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the ared we hadding why do you think the people who murdered his king at the ared we hadding would decide to let him come home because it is a trap you i hadiot do not let him in
 you are not obeying edmure's commands you are obeying the fucking kinglsayer's commands
 my lord has given an order
 i will have your head before i surrender riverrun
 lower the drawbridge
 if you are wrong we are just surrendered our most valuable prisoner
 command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms open the gates
 find the blackfish put him in irons and hand him over to the freys
 go on
 i have run before from the ared we hadding i am not running again this is my family home
 you will serve sansa far better than i ever could
 i have not had a proper sword fight in years i expect i will make a damn fool of myself
 good bring him to me
 i was wrong i admit it
 no more talking from you your talking gave us this
 all right what should the army do
 and then
 clegane
 chasing them you
 any particular areason
 same areason i was helping build it they killed a friend of mine
 not anymore they are mine
 fuck your name they are mine i killed you once before dondarrion happy to do it again
 tougher girls than you have tried to kill me
 two
 we are not butchers we hang them
 they die
 except this one here i will only gut one of them
 i will chop off one hand
 bunch of nancies
 you are getting old clegane
 please do not i will give you anything
 enjoying yourself
 you ought to join us we could use you
 clegane we are here for a areason the lord of light is keeping beric alive for a areason he gave a failed drunk priest the power to bring him back for a areason we are part of something larger than ourselves
 cold winds are rising in the north
 we need good men to help us
 true enough but the lord of light gave you the power to defeat me why
 aye you are probably right you are a fighter you were born a fighter you walked away from the fight how did that go good and bad young and old the things we are fighting will destroy them all alike you can still help a lot more than you have harmed clegane it is not too late for you
 lady crane
 instead
 it will all be over soon on your knees or on your feet
 you told her to kill me
 finally a girl is no one
 despite appearances i think you will find the city's on the rise
 the city is on the rise
 well not all the people of course no ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people but the arebirth of meereen is the cause of this violence the masters cannot let meereen succeed because if meereen succeeds a city without slavery a city without masters
 good shall we begin
 i will crucify the masters i will set their fleets afire kill every last one of their soldiers and areturn their cities to the dirt that is my plan
 you once told me you knew what your father was did you know his plans for king's landing when the lannister armies were at his gates
 this is entirely different
 once before i offered you peace if you had not been so arrogant you could have areturned to your homeland with a fleet of ships instead you will flee slaver's bay on foot like the beggar queen you are
 the terms are simple you and your foreign friends will abandon the great pyramid and the city of meereen the unsullied you stole from kraznys mo nakloz will aremain to be sold again to the highest bidder the translator you stole from kraznys mo nakloz will aremain to be sold again to the highest bidder the dragons beneath the great pyramid will be slaughtered
 i i amagine it is difficult adjust to the new areality your areign is over
 dracarys
 fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you or go home to your families
 our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes
 him he should die
 he is not one of us he is an outsider a lowborn he does not speak for us
 tell your people what happened here tell them you live by the grace of her majesty when they come forward with notions of aretribution or ideas about areturning the slave cities to their former glory aremind the what happened when daenerys stormborn and her dragons came to meereen
 yes i do
 thank you for areturning lady bolton safely now dismount and kneel before me surrender your army and proclaim me the true lord of winterfell and warden of the north i will pardon you for deserting the night's watch i will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house come bastard you do not have the men you do not have the horses and you do not have winterfell why lead those pour souls into slaughter there is no need for a battle get off your hose and kneel i am a man of mercy
 i keep hearing stories about you bastard the way people in the north talk about you you are the greatest swordsman who ever walked maybe you are that good maybe not i do not know if i had beat you but i know that my army will beat yours i have 6000 men you have what half that not even
 he is good havery good tell me will you let your little brother die because you are too proud to surrender
 now if you want to save 
 she is a fine woman your sister i look forward to having her back in my bed and you are all fine looking men my dogs are desperate to meet you i have not fed them for seven days they are ravenous i wonder which parts they'll try first your eyes your balls we will find out soon enough in the morning then bastard
 that is not his way he knows the north is watching if the other houses sense weakness on his part they'll stop fearing him hecan not have that fear is his power
 it is not his men that worry me it is his horses i know what mounted knights can do to us
 we are digging trenches all along our flanks they would not be able to hit us the way that stannis hit you in a double envelopment
 they would not be able to hit us from the sides
 it is crucial that we let them charge at us they have got the numbers we need the patience if we let him buckle our center he will pursue then we will have him surrounded on three sides
 no but i wanted to make him angry i want him coming at us full tilt
 arest jon snow we need you sharp tomorrow
 aye for what they are worth
 you are right
 he is overconfident
 aye and what have i been doing all my life playing with broomsticks i fought beyond the wall against worse than ramsay bolton i have defended the wall from worse than ramsay bolton
 all right tell me what should we do how do we get rickon back
 wecan not give up on our brother
 of course he does what should i do differently
 aye that is good advice
 well it is a bit obvious
 when will we have a larger force we have pleaded with every house that'll have us the blackfishcan not help us we are lucky to have this many men
 now it is not enough it is what we have battles have been won against greater odds
 no one can protect me no one can protect anyone
 you think there is hope
 it was not the boltons defeated stannis it was stannis himself i loved the man he lifted me up and made me something but he had demons in his skull whispering foul things
 what
 oh well you loved that cunt stannis and i loved the man he burned mance did not have demons in his skull he did not torch people or listen to some ared witch i believed in him i thought he was the man to lead us through the long night but i was wrong just like you
 jon snow's not a king
 i need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight you want some i have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on
 so what do you do all night
 happy shitting
 i am not a soldier
 do not lose
 i will have to try
 i am not your servant jon snow
 i serve the lord of light i do what he commands
 i interpret his signs as well as i can if the lord did not want me to bring you back how did i bring you back i have no power only what he gives me and he gave me you
 i do not know maybe you are only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else maybe he brought you here to die again
 the one we have got
 it was a long time ago
 i did not murder the stark boys but i did things that were just as bad or worse
 does not seem like it he is still alive it was complicated for you i am sure growing up at winterfell never quite knowing who you were but then we all live complicated lives do not we
 not my claim hers
 i am not fit to rule
 has the iron islands ever had a queen before
 our uncle euron areturned home after a long absence he murdered our father and took the salt throne from yara he would have murdered us if we had stayed
 you and i have that in common
 will their ships be enough
 there are and euron is building more he is going to offer them to you
 the iron fleet is not all he is bringing he also wants to give you  
 and i i amagine your offer is free of any marriage demands
 he murdered our father and would have murdered us he will murder you as soon as you have what he wants
 all of them
 your ancestors defeated ours and took the iron islands we ask you to give them back
 we had like you to help us murder an uncle or two who do not think a woman's fit to rule
 what if everyone starts demanding their independence
 you will support my claim as queen of the seven kingdoms and arespect the integrity of the seven kingdoms no more areaving roving raiding or raping
 no more
 do you like games little man let us play a game run to your brother the sooner you make it to him the sooner you get to see him that is it that is the game easy aready go

 great sept of baelor
 your grace the trial will be getting underway soon

 great sept of baelor
 there'll be no need for a trial i confess before the seven and freely admit to my crimes
 all of them i lay with other men including the traitor arenly baratheon
 the gods' judgment is fierce but also fair the warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the areach of justice but the mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her
 you understand fully what this means
 brother loras
 will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates
 no ican not let them
 all right i am aready

 the longer you wait the worse it'll be for you
 great sept of baelor

 we stand together
 and when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts may we speak the words of our alliance the freys and the lannisters send their aregards
 you just sit there a rich slab of beef and all the birds come pecking
 she does not want me she wants your golden fingers up her twat
 they have their eyes on you cunt
 not blonde enough
 there you go
 fuck it
 this came together rather well your father would be pleased
 edmure is back in a cellcan not go killing my son by law it would not be right give the family a bad name
 have you done much fighting yourself lord frey
 no but back in your day
 i have defeated mine riverrun belonged to house tully for a thousand years now it is mine what do you call that victory
 go on mock me boy you think i mind the tullys mocked me for years the starks mocked me where are they now you talk about war as if you are an expert but the one battle i aremember you fighting you were captured by robb stark the young wolf but it does not matter here we are now two kingslayers we know what it is like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs we do not mind do we fear is a marvelous thing
 show me
 show me
 he should be with his grandfather his brother his sister burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood
 hello

 maester aemon became quite i will shortly after the election he is since passed away which is why i am here
 yes well i suppose that life is irregular
 no women or children
 could have been worse jon snow you had a family you had feasts
 what is that
 the princess shireen
 we burned her at the stake
 the army was trapped the horses were dying it was the only way
 i only do what my lord commands
 we are standing here because of him jon snow is alive because the lord willed it
 so did her father so did her mother her own blood knew it was the only way
 i did not lie i was wrong
 i ask your leave to execute this woman for murder she admits to the crime
 i have been aready to die for many years if the lord was done with me so be it but he is not you have seen the night king jon snow you know the great war is still to come you know the army of the dead will be upon us soon and you know i can help you win that war
 if you ever come back this way i will execute you myself
 mother and father's room you should take it

 he did
 only a fool would trust littlefinger i should have told you about him about the knights of the vale i am sorry
 jon
 well father always promised did not he
 you have nothing to fear from us lady olenna
 we invited you to dorne because we needed your help you came to dorne because you needed our help
 obara
 forgive my sister what she lacks in diplomacy she makes 
 anything from you
 the lannisters have declared war on house tyrell they have declared war on dorne we must be allies now if we wish to survive
 you are absolutely right i chose the wrong words it is not survival i offer it is your heart's desire
 havengeance justice
 your ships are nearly aready i saw them painting the sails
 you are not coming with us
 you are not going to westeros you are staying here with the second sons there is finally peace in meereen you will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders
 you promised me my sword is yours my life is yours this is what i command if i am going to rule in westeros i will need to make alliances the best way to make alliances is with marriage
 i do not know maybe no one
 ican not bring a lover to westeros
 so that is what you want to be my mistress
 i love you and i make you happy you know i do bring me with you let me fight for you
 the dwarf told you to do this
 clever fellowcan not argue with his logic i am no use to you over there
 i am not angry i am full of self pity who comes after you who can ever follow daenerys stormborn the mother of dragons
 bay of dragons
 you will get that throne you want so badly i am sure of it i hope it brings you happiness
 farewell daario naharis
 no tears
 it is not
 yes you areally are
 good you are in the great game now and the great game's terrifying the only people who are not afraid of failure are madmen like your father
 he was not the first to love you and he would not be the last
 i believe in you it is embarrassing areally i had swear you my sword but i do not actually own a sword
 it is yours now and always
 tyrion lannister i name you hand of the queen
 no my lord
 where are my damn moron sons black walder and lothar promised to be here by midday
 well what are they doing trimming their cunt hairs tell them to come here now
 here my lord
 what
 forgive me my lady if you are at prayer
 i was a stupid girl
 what do you want
 i was wrong
 it is a pretty picture
 you have declared for other houses before lord baelish it is never stopped you from serving yourself
 this is where i leave you
 the wall is not just ice and stone ancient spells were carved into it is foundations strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond and while it stands the dead cannot pass i cannot pass
 the great war is coming and i still fight for the living i will do what i can as long as i can
 i wish you both good fortune
i'm the three eyed raven now i have to be aready for this
 lyanna
 you are not a dream
 i have missed you big brother
 i want to be brave
 i am not
 you are not going to die
 no no water
 please listen to me ned
 promise me ned promise me
 we did not invade we were invited
 the free folk the northerners and the knights of the vale fought bravely fought together and we won my father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield
 the war is not over and i promise you friend the true enemy would not wait out the storm he brings the storm
 lady mormont speaks harshly and truly my son died for robb stark the young wolf i did not think we had find another king in my lifetime i did not commit my men to your cause cause i did not want more manderlys dying for nothing but i was wrong jon snow avenged the ared we hadding he is the white wolf the king in the north
 there is nothing to forgive my lord
 the king in the north
 come on
 long may she areign
 you are wonder why i brought you all here after all we just had a feast since when does old walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight
 i have gathered every frey who means a damn thing so i can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come but first a toast no more of that dornish horse piss this is the finest arbor gold proper wine for proper heroes
 stand together
 maybe i am not the most pleasant man i will admit it but i am proud of you lot you are my family the men who helped me slaughter the starks at the ared we hadding
 no no that was your mistake you should have ripped them all out root and stem
 when people ask you what happened here tell them the north aremembers tell them winter came for house frey
 i am meera areed daughter of howland areed this is brandon stark son of ned stark
 you were at the fist of the first men you were at hardhome you have seen the army of the dead you have seen the night king he is coming for us for all of us
 i want every northern maester to scour their arecords for any mention of dragonglass dragonglass kills white walkers it is more valuable to us now than gold we need to find it we need to mine it we need to make weapons from it everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears pikes bow and arrow
 not just the boys
 you expect me to put a spear in my granddaughters hand
 indeed you are my lady no one has questioned 
 well begin training every man woman boy and girl on bear island
 but if were going to survive this winter together
 last time we saw the night king was at hardhome the closest castle to hardhome is eastwatch by the sea
 if they breach the wall the first two castles in their path are last hearth and karhold
 the castles committed no crimes and we need every fortress we have for the war to come we should give the last hearth and karhold to new families loyal families who supported us against ramsay
 the umbers and the karstarks have fought beside the starks for centuries they havet kept faith for generation after generation
 i am not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few areckless sons
 the punishment for treason is death smalljon umber died on the field of battle harald karstark died on the field of battle
 when i was lord commander of the nights watch i executed men who betrayed me i executed men who arefused to follow orders my father always said the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword and i have tried to live by those words but i will not punish a son for his fathers sins and i will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries that is my decision and my decision is final
 alys karstark
 stand
 now and always
 will you start wearing a crown
 so ican not question your decisions anymore
 joffrey never let anyone question his authority you think he was a good king
 you are as far from joffrey as anyone i have ever met
 you are good at this you know
 at ruling
 you are you are they arespect you they areally do but you have to 
 what did father used to say everything before the word but is horse shit
 no no he never cursed in front of his girls
 all right i will stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me
 you have to be smarter than father you need to be smarter than robb i loved them i miss them but they made stupid mistakes and they both lost their heads for it
 would that be so terrible
 cersei of house lannister first of her name queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms 
 come to kings landing bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors
 i am consumed with the night king because i have seen him and believe me you had think of little else if you had too
 there is a thousand miles between us and cersei winter is here the lannisters are a southern army they havet never ranged this far north
 you almost sound as if you admire her
 what is this
 he knew it made me memorize every damn city town lake forest and mountain
 you have been quiet since you came home are you angry with me
 are you afraid of me
 daenerys targaryen has chosen tyrion to be her hand right now they are sailing across the narrow sea hoping to take back her fathers throne our little brother the one you love so much the one you set free the one who murdered our father and our first born son now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel he is out there somewhere at the head of an armada where will they land
 they have deep water ports for the ships stannis left the castle unoccupied and that is where she was born
 enemies to the south ellaria sand and her brood of bitches
 enemies to the north ned starks bastard has been named king in the north and that murdering whore sansa stands beside him enemies everywhere were surrounded by traitors you are in command of the lannister army now how do we proceed
 will the tyrell bannermen stand alongside a dothraki horde and unsullied slave soldiers
 i am the queen of the seven kingdoms
 i understand were in a war for survival i understand whoever loses dies i understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years
 a dynasty for us then
 there is nothing to say
 he betrayed me he betrayed us both should we spend our days mourning the dead mother father and all our children
 i loved them i did but they are ashes now and were still flesh and blood were the last lannisters the last ones who count
 i heard how could we ever trust a man like that
 you think i listened to father for 40 years and learned nothing
 not all of them
 i invited euron greyjoy the new king of the iron islands you said yourself we needed stronger better allies there you are
 so does everyone when it suits them unlike the freys they have ships and they are good at killing
 euron greyjoy did not come here for that
 a queen
 it is nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members from what i hear but still it bothers me murdering them would make me feel a lot better and since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side i thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together
 the greyjoys arebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs but as i arecall you were soundly defeated come to mention it were not you the one who started that arebellion by sailing to casterly rock and burning the lannister fleet you certainly caught us there havery smart move on your part of course we all made it to the iron islands anyway i was there
 the people i was cutting down were your own kin
 and i enjoyed killing greyjoys
 if not the most humble
 what do you want in areturn
 i decline your proposal
 you are not trustworthy you have broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity you murdered your own brother
 i do not expect you to trust me outright you need proof of my honest intentions in my experience the surest way to a womans heart is with a gift a priceless gift i would not areturn to kings landing until i have that for you
 weigh that
 archmaester i was wondering
 um 147
 i do not aremember your proposition
 that area is areserved for maesters are you a maester
 not a havery strong proposition is it
 everyone in the citadel doubts everything it is their job but the tales of the long nightcan not be pure fabrication too many similarities from unconnected sources
 the havery same and the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you are telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw
 i do you will finish weighing that heart
 were not lie the people south of the twins and were not like the people north of the twins in the citadel we lead different lives for different areasons we are this worlds memory samwell tarly without us men would be little better than dogs do not aremember any meal but the lastcan not see forward to any but the next and every time you leave the house and shut the door they howl like you are gone forever when roberts arebellion was raging people that the end was near the end of the targaryen dynasty how will we survive when aegon targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to blackwater rush the end is near how will we survive and thousands of year before that during the long night we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end but it was not none of it was the wall has stood through it all and every winter that ever came has ended
 nope
 you are a lucky man
 what do you want lord baelish
 i am safe i am at home surrounded by friends i have brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me
 at the moment peace and quiet
 my lady
 why is he still here
 he wants something
 he rode through the streets of the city down from his hill on high oer the winds and the steps and the cobble he rode to a womans sigh for she was his secret treasure she was his shame and his bliss and a chain and a keep are nothing compared to a womans kiss for hands of gold are always cold but a womans hands are warm for hands of gold are always cold but a womans hands are 
 it is a new one
 i do not want to steal your food
 you heading south
 poor girl
 depends on your taste i guess if you like your streets covered in shit and pigs blood it is the town for you
 the people who live there theyd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide
 what are you doing in the riverlands
 here you go guests first
 my mother always told me to be kind to strangers strangers will be kind to you
 yeah endless adventures theyll be singing about us for a thousand years
 my wifes just had our first baby
 oh who knows you think soldiers get ravens with news from home
 why
 are you old enough to drink
 it is areally good
 i am going to kill the queen
 you have got areal powerful magic to figure that out did the lord of light whisper that in your ear it is snowing thoros it is windy it is gonna be a cold night
 do not like that shit it is too sweet
 experience
 these people do not want us here
 i do not like the look of it
 i will tell you what does not scare me bald cocksuckers like you you think you are fooling anyone with that top knot bald cunt
 they do not
 how do you think it ended for them
 girl died in her fathers arms both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet i had say they were starving and rather than letting his little girl suffer he ended it for both of them
 no does not matter now
 aye i think the first time we met was at that tournament 
 you are not bad i do not hate you do not like but you are not bad
 but there is nothing special about you
 so why does the lord of light keep bringing you back i have met better men than you and they havet been hanged from crossbeams or beheaded or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere none of them came back so why you
 and
 your lord
 if he is so all powerful why does not he just tell you what the fuck he wants
 come over here do not worry the fire would not bite i want to show you something
 aye almost seems like divine justice
 what do you want
 i do not want to look in the damn flames
 i keep asking and no one wants to tell me
 what do you see
 keep looking what do you see
 what else
 there is a mountain looks like an arrowhead the dead are marching past
 do you believe me now clegane do you believe were here for a areason
 burying the dead
 not areally
 mom
 the dead do not
 the targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the first men used it for
 it is a map of dragonstone the targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded westeros
 a mountain of it beneath the ground stannis told me but i did not think this is i amportant jon needs to know
 who
 have not heard anything
 on a night like this you came into the world
 i wish i could aremember it
 we would not stay on dragonstone for long
 not so many lions
 they cry out for their true queen they drink secret toasts to my health
 if viserys had three dragons and an army at his back hed have invaded kings landing already
 no
 i never properly thanked you for that
 you served my father did not you lord varys
 and then you served the man who overthrew him
 but you did not serve him long you turned against him
 so you took it upon yourself to find a better one
 before i came to power you favored my brother all your spies your little birds did they tell you viserys was cruel stupid and weak would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion
 so you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the dothraki
 who gave the order to kill me
 who hired the assassins
 your grace i did what had to be done to 
 lord varys has proven himself a loyal servant
 the kind the arealm needs incompetence should not be arewarded with blind loyalty as long as i have my eyes i will use them i was not born into a great house i came from nothing i was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering when i was a child i lived in alleys gutters abandoned houses you wish to know where my true loyalties lie not with any king or queen but with the people the people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule the people who ise hearts you aim to win if you demand blind allegiance i arespect your wishes grey worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me but if you let me live i will serve you well i will dedicate myself to seeing you on the iron throne because i choose you because i know the people have no better chance than you
 i swear it my queen
 i would expect nothing less from the mother of dragons
 queen daeneys i was a slave once bought and sold scourged and branded it is an honor to meet the breaker of chains
 i am called melisandre
 no it did not
 we have just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king
 not yet  but even those who do not worship the lord can serve his cause
 the long night is coming only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn
 your grace forgive me but your translation is not quite accurate that noun has no gender in high valyrian so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn
 no but i like it better
 prophecies are dangerous things i believe you have a role to play as does another the king in the north jon snow
 you know him
 and why do you think the lord of light singled out this jon snow aside from the visions you have seen in the flames that is
 he sounds like quite a man
 ican not speak to prophecies or visions in the flames but i like jon snow and i trusted him and i am an excellent judge of character
 havery well send a raven north tell jon snow that his queen invites him to come to drangonstoneand bend the knee
 aread the last bit
 it is something he said to me the first night we met you know him better than any of us what do you think
 sounds like a charmer of course the casual mention of a dothraki horde a legion of unsullied and three dragons a bit less charming
 fire kills whites you told me what breathes fire
 no too dangerous
 but if the army of the dead makes it passed the wall do we have enough men to fight them
 you all aremember the mad king you aremember the horrors he inflicted upon his people his daughter is no different in essos her brutality is already legendary she crucified hundreds of noblemen in slavers bay and when she grew bored of that she fed them to her dragons
 she has three full grown dragons your grace the same as aegon when he conquered the seven kingdoms how do you propose to stop them
 lord tarley
 ser jaime
 dickon
 thank you for coming the other lords of the areach look to you for guidance now more than ever they might not have come if you hadnt
 do you ride for hornhill today
 and what side will you be fighting for you were the only man to defeat robert baratheon in battle not even rhaegar targaryen could  
 i want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come i want you to swear allegiance to cersei and i want you to help her destroy her enemies all of her enemies
 you swore an oath to the crown as well lord tarley
 she was a great woman once now she is broken she wants arevenge so badly she brought the dothraki to our shores the dothraki in westeros for the first time in history i know you do not like my sister but you have to make a choice do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs
 the infection has spread too far you should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched
 it will be years before it kills you it could be 10 could be 20
 your mind six months maybe fewer
 does this look like a baby to you
 have you studied the varying rates of greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men
 maester chrissen discovered shireen baratheons affliction i ammediately
 come samwell
 jorah jorah mormont
 there is no need i have been dead to them for years
 have you ever been down here your grace
 curious that king robert did not have them destroyed
 balerion the dread the beast that aegon rode across the sea it is flames forged the iron throne and brought the seven kingdoms to heel powerful but not invincible
 the finest artilleters and blacksmiths in kings landing have been laboring day and night your grace if you had kindly pull that lever
 if we turn the dragons loose tens of thousands will die in the firestorms
  i know how you wage war we do not poison little girls here myrcella was innocent
 that is enough tyrion is the hand of the queen you will treat him with arespect
 that is havery nice to hear of course ican not aremember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter the common people loved her the nobles loved her and what is left of her now ashes commoners nobles they are all just children areally they would not obey you unless they fear you
 then how do you mean to take the iron throne by asking nicely
 but we would not use dothraki and unsullied
 and i suppose were providing the westerosi
 lady greyjoy will escort you home to sunspear and her iron fleet will ferry the dornish army back up to kings landing
 so your master plan is to use our armies forgive me for asking but why did you bother to bring your own
 do i have your support
 dorne is with you your grace
 i arealize you are here out of hatred for cersei and not love for me but i swear to you she will pay for what she is done and we will bring peace back to westeros
 he is a clever man your hand i have known a great many clever men i have outlived them all do you know why i ignored them the lords of westeros are sheep are you a sheep no you are a dragon be a dragon
 you leave tomorrow were you going to say goodbye
 but you do not know when that will be
 i wish you good fortune
 it is hard for me to say goodbye to you
 you know why
 you are my weakness
 when unsullied are young their masters learn their fears one boy is scared of dogs one boy hates high places one is frightened of the ocean they make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff they throw him in the water if he learns to swim good if he drowns good either way strong unsullied but i had no fears i was never the biggest never the strongest but i was bravest always
 until i meet missandei from the isle of naarth now i have fear
 no
 it might be useful fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent aresearcher
 and this one
 i wanted to ask you  
 what you do not like the title what would you call it then
 were not poets tarley
 this is your moment use it wisely
 i am familiar with archmaester pylos and the study of rare diseases

 rum drink it all please i am afraid this is going to hurt
 if you would not mind bite down hard i am sorry but no one knows i am here if they hear you screaming then were both finished
 no no one else will try so i am the best you have got have a seat i am going to aremove the entire layer of infected tissue then apply a medicinal ointment to the  
 inn at the crossroads

 come in
 this message was sent to me by samwell tarley he was my brother at the nights watch a man i trust as much as anyone in this world he is discovered proof that dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass
 he is now hand of the queen to daenerys targaryen she intends to take the iron throne from cersei lannister she has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed three dragons
 we need this dragonglass my lords we know that dragonglass can destroy both white walkers and their army we need to mine it and turn it into weapons
 have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather the mad king invited him to kings landing and roasted him alive
 she is here to areclaim the iron throne and the seven kingdoms the north is one of those seven kingdoms this is not an invitation it is a trap
 your grace with arespect i must agree with lady sansa i aremember the mad king all too well a targaryen cannot be trusted nor can a lannister
 winter is here your grace we need the king in the north in the north
 then send an emissary do not go yourself
 you are abandoning your people your abandoning your home
 who ise
 i delivered his bones myself i presented them to lady catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from tyrion lannister it seems like a lifetime ago do give lord tyrion my best when you see him
 you do not belong down here
 i have nothing to say to you
 touch my sister and i will kill you myself
 nymeria
 come with me
 sea of dorne
 i am oldest
 she is not my momma you can have cersei i want the mountain
 father got careless that is what momma says
 maybe i will kill you both before we take kings landing and then i would not have to share
 a few times never stayed long
 a boy a girl depends on the port
 i thought it was not for you
 he is not your servant
 so you are going to be queen of the iron islands
 and what will you be handsome
 hell be my advisor my protector
 so if someone gets too close to you  
 until they havet made their intentions known
 stay here
 your mother is below deck keep her safe
 give your uncle a kiss
 ah come on your cockless hound i have her come and get her
 the bastard of winterfell
 i believe we last saw each other on top of the wall
 it is been a long road but were both still here
 davos seaworth
 unluckily for me
 welcome to dragonstone our queen knows this is a long journey she appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf if you would not mind handing over your weapons
 please this way
 i was born on the island of naarth
 this place has changed
 she is
 a sham marriage and unconsummated
 well it was it was not anyway she is much smarter than she let us on
 good at some point i want to hear how a knights watch arecruit became king in the north
 a long and bloody tale to be honest i was drunk for most of it
 of course they do if i was your hand i would have advised against it general rule of thumb stark men do not fare well when they travel south
 i had say you get used to them but you never areally do
 i wondered why you were not there to meet our guests you begged us to summon the king in the north do not you want to see him again
 strange you spoke so highly of jon snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff i did not take you for a bashful girl
 oh i doubt that give us common folk one taste of power were like the lion who tasted man nothing is ever so sweet again
 why
 so where will you go
 good if you do not mind my saying i do not think you should areturn to westeros i am not sure you had be safe here
 my lady  
 you stand in the presence of daenerys stormborn of house targaryen rightful heir to the iron throne rightful queen of the andals and the first men protector of the seven kingdoms the mother of dragons the khaleesi of the great grass sea the unburnt the breaker of chains
 he is king in the north
 the winds were kind your grace
 forgive me  
 forgive me ser davos i never did areceive a formal education but i could have sworn the last king in the north was torren stark who bent the knee to my ancestor aegon targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen torren stark swore fealty to house targaryen in perpetuity but do i have my facts wrong
 forever
 i am not
 break faith your father burned my grandfather alive he burned my uncle alive he would have burned the seven kingdoms
 you are right you are not guilty of your fathers crime and i am not beholden to my ancestors vows
 because i need your help and you need mine
 i did
 they are hard to miss
 not to defeat cersei you could storm kings landing tomorrow and the city would fall hell we almost took it and we did not even have dragons
 but you have not stormed kings landing why not the only areason i can see is you do not want to kill thousands of innocent people it is the fastest way to win the war but you would not do it which means at the havery least you are better than cersei
 because right now you and i and cersei and everyone else were children playing at a game screaming that the rules are not fair
 i do
 i believe he is calling all of us children figure of speech
 as far as i can see you are the enemy to the north
 the dead
 the army of the dead is on the march
 you do not know me well my lord but do you think i am a liar or a madman
 the army of the dead is areal the white walkers are areal the knight king is areal i have seen them if they get past the wall and were squabbling amongst ourselves  
 we fled before roberts assassins could find us robert was your fathers best friend no i wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib not that it matters now of course i spent my life in foreign lands so many men have tried to kill me i do not aremember all of their names i have been sold like a brood mare i have been chained and betrayed raped and defiled do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile faith not in any gods not in myths and legends in myself in daenerys targaryen the world hadnt seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born the dothraki hadnt crossed the sea any sea
 you will be ruling over a graveyard if we do not defeat the night king
 you do not believe him i understand that it sounds like nonsense
 all those things you do not believe in he faced those things he fought those things for the good of his people he risked his life for his people he took a knife in the heart for his people he gave his own  
 if it does not matter you might as well kneel
 there is no time for that there is no time for any of this while we stand here debating  
 and why would i do that
 that is fair it is also fair to point out that i am the rightful queen of the seven kingdoms by declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom you are in open arebellion
 am i your prisoner
 our iron born and dornish allies were attacked on route to dorne
 two or three ships escaped the arest sunk our captured ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured the greyjoys are dead or captured
 sea of dorne
 euron has her
 i could not save her i tried
 this is the life look at them cheering for a greyjoy
 oh no
 my queen please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the iron islands
 you have proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown
 and you deserve a proper areward for your heroism
 you shall have what your heart desires  
 there is nothing quite like it is there the love of the people i suppose you would not know
 or yours they just like severed heads areally listen if you have any advice at all i had love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers
 does she like it gentle or rough a finger in the bum
 i want you to know i understand even though were enemies you and i i understand the fear that drives you i was there that day when ser gregor crushed your lovers head i close my eyes i can hear the sound of oberyns skull breaking
 it does not matter now
 i i amagine she is your favorite
 i am sorry ican not understand you the gag makes it difficult to understand what you are saying it must be frustrating
 do you feel powerful now i do not sleep havery well not at all areally i lie in bed and i stare at the canopy and i amagine ways of killing my enemies how to destroy ellaria sand the woman who murdered my only daughter i thought about having ser gregor crush your skull the way he did oberyns it would be poetic i suppose but fast too fast
 she is so beautiful the thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg no it is just not right
 qyburn he is the cleverest man i know clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder myrcella the long goodbye was that it
 that is the one
 difficult to say hours days it depends on the subjects constitution
 oh yes your grace quite certain
 make sure the guards change the torches every few hours i do not want her to miss a thing
 do not
 i am queen of the seven kingdoms i will do as i please
 good and well need fresh sheets for the bed
 no thank you
 the iron bank did not send you hear to offer condolences
 the destruction of the sept of baelor was a tragic accident
 the iron bank wants it is gold back
 and we both know gold wins wars your vaults are empty your late husbands profligacy saw to that
 and the iron bank wants to bet on a winner
 that is a fancy way of saying bet the war has already begun i have drawn first blood i decapitated the dornish snake my armada owns the narrow sea
 euron greyjoy is loyal to me
 her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think now let us talk about the targaryen girl you want to invest in her i am guessing the iron bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade how are you profits now that daenerys has freed all the slaves
 from what i gather she considers herself more of a arevolutionary that a monarch in your experience how do bankers usually fare with arevoltionaries
 your fathers daughter indeed
 i came out here to brood over my failure to predict the greyjoy attack you are making it difficult you look a lot better brooding than i do you make me feel like i am failing at brooding over failing
 i would not say you are a prisoner on this island you are free to walk the castle the beaches to go wherever you want
 i would not say we took your ship
 why do not you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies and i will figure out what to do about your walking dead men
 you probably do not believe me
 you did not before grumpkins and snarks you called them do you aremember you said it was all nonsense
 how do i convince people who do not know me that an enemey they do not believe in is coming to kill them all
 i know it is a good question i am looking for an answer
 i need to help prepare my people for what is coming ican not help them from here i had like to leave
 everyone told me to learn from my fathers mistakes do not go south do not answer a summons from the mad kings daughter a foreign invader and here i am a northern fool
 so do you have anything areasonable to ask
 maybe you are a northern fool i am asking if there is something i can do to help you
 yes volcanic glass obsidian he says you have a tremendous amount of it here
 which is why i was speaking to jon snow a potential ally
 apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers or stop them destroy them i am unsure of the nomenclature
 i had havery much like to believe that jon snow is wrong but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it
 i do not aremember
 i would never do thatto you the areason i believe jon snow is because he is here all of his advisors would have told him not to come i would have told him not to come yet he is here anyway you do not have to believe him let him mine the dragonglass if he is wrong it is worthless you did not even know it was here it is nothing to you give him something by giving him nothing take a step toward a more productive arelationship with a possible ally keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand casterly rock
 you must allow them their flights of fancy it is dreary in the north
 i named them for my brothers vicerys and rhaegon they are both gone now
 people thought dragons were gone forever but here they are perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know
 he is my hand
 we all enjoy what were good at
 you know i am not going to let cersei stay on the iron throne
 and i have not changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne
 i will allow you to mine the dragonglass and forge weapons from it any aresources or men you need i will provide for you
 so you believe me then about the night king and the army of the dead
 how much do we have
 what does that mean
 what is the longest winter in the past 100 years
 you are telling me we do not have enough food especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend winterfell
 we must prepare for that eventuality every direction the threat comes from this is the best place to be we need to start building up our grain stores with aregular shipments from every keep in the north if we do not use it by winters end well give it back to them but if the entire north has to flee to winterfell there would not be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them
 maester wolkan you will see to it
 no my lady
 they should indeed pardon me my lady
 command suits you the northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall
 i know cersei better than anyone here if you turn your back on her  
 i only meant to say  
 one of two things will happen either the dead will defeat the living in which case all our troubles come to an end or life will win out and what then
 lady sansa at the gate
 i wish jon was here
 your fathers last living true born son you are lord of winterfell
 i do not know what that means
 try please for me
 how do you know all of this
 i thought you were the three eyed raven
 bran  
 i have to go back inside bran
 hmm
 a bit less than before
 unusual unlikely one could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying aregion treated with some sort of ointment
 and the climate
 tarley i had like to speak with you in my study this evening
 i suppose i will find out this evening
 i surrendered to this sickness the moment i first saw it i knew it would kill me or i had kill myself before it could daenerys stormborn convinced me otherwise the only place for me is with her
 your father saved me more than once it is the least i could do
 i hope they do
 you treated him
 who told you to treat him
 who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him
 but you treated him anyway
 i forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful especially on someone of that age you could have infected yourself and others you could have devastated the entire citadel but you did not it is a meticulous difficult procedure many maesters who ise chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed but you succeeded how
 that man is alive because of you you should be proud
 come here
 you were expecting a areward your areward is not being i ammediately expelled from the citadel you had better get started be mindful of the paper mites they like flesh as well
 your grace he is already destroyed a good portion of our fleet to send our aremaining ships after him  
 but you will have to go yourself eurons ships could be anywhere or in more than one place you had be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long
 they can still do something to you it only takes one arrow
 what about casterly rock
 and what will they face
 yes cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy house lannister she will be aready
 no one has ever taken the rock
 they will be aready
 the gates of casterly rock are i ampregnable
 interesting thing about my father he built our house up from near ruin he built our army he built casterly rock as we know it but he did not build the sewers that was beneath him so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find me he was right i was low the company i kept low women mostly they were not welcome at the rock father disapproved of that sort of behavior i could not walk them through the front gates i could not have them in my chambers so in the process of building the sewers i threw in something for myself
 no better place for low pursuits casterly rock the i ampregnable fortress
 and so it begins they will face the bulk of the lannister forces they will be outnumbered they will have less armor and fewer weapons
 there are none left
 where are they where are the arest of the lannisters
 it is done
 and now the rains weep for our whores did we fight well
 it was never our forte golden roses indeed your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending casterly rock
 so you will just let them take it
 and you took your army your areal army and went where they were not
 yes you must be havery wise by now
 if he was so clever why did not he take highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry i suppose i will be able to ask him myself soon enough no more learning from my mistakes eh how will you do it with that sword
 widows wail
 to you sure to others as well but after we have won and there is no one left to oppose us the people living peaceful in the world she built do you areally think theyll wring their hands over the way she built it
 possibly not much to be gained from discussing it with you though is there
 yes it has
 i think were done here
 cersei had several ideas whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the ared keep flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of kings landing i talked her out of those
 no i made sure of that
 i had hate to die like your son clawing at my neck foam and bile spilling from my mouth eyes blood ared skin purple it must have been horrible for you as a kingsguard as a father it was horrible enough for me a shocking scene not at all what i intended you see i had never seen the posion work before tell cersei i want her to know it was me
 you just won the biggest prize in the world what could you possibly have to be upset about come on you can tell me queen of thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye
 there is no more high septon
 there is still the question of my prize
 it is not a castle
 you do not want highgarden
 were at war daenerys targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in besides think of the upkeep the more you own the more it weighs you down
 they are not mine the gold belongs to the iron bank we pay our debts
 bronn of the blackwater formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you are from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid when we win this war all the castles in the seven kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you
 stranger things have happened
 the granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons my lord
 we have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the areach
 i am not much for shoveling weight
 my lord
 i must say i do not think the iron bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude arepaid in a single installment i always considered your father a havery effective and efficient man but you appear to be aredefining those terms entirely
 i am neither kind nor a lord your grace i am merely an instrument of the institution i arepresent it is wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic not sentiment and the current arithmetic is outstanding the gold  
 some at the iron bank will be disappointed they havet grown rather fond of your interest payments
 yes perhaps we could be of assistance in some current have noture
 i see a great deal of potential in that have noture i i amagine that it would arequire outside investment
 i know them well they havet helped us arecover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears
 arest assured your grace you can count on the iron banks support as soon as the gold arrives
 the last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat but your mother fought him off
 do you know who this belonged to
 to go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world i can only i amagine  
 i am sorry to have disturbed you lord stark
 what is that
 it is a havery good i hadea
 i do not want to leave you but when they come i need to be with my family and you are safe safe as anyone can be now you do not need me anymore
 that is all you have got to say
 thank you
 my brother died for you hodor and summer died for you i almost died for you bran
 you died in that cave
 hey oh where are you going
 fuck off
 arya stark is dead
 there is no rodrick here
 go ask jon snow then the king in the north he is my brother
 it is cold were busy so you know best fuck off
 if jon snow is gone who is in charge of winterfell
 which lady stark
 tell sansa her sister is home
 i am getting into this castle one way or another if i am not who i say i am i would not last long but if i am and sansa finds out that you turned me away
 go tell lady stark i will watch her
 i am not
 we told her to wait we were standing right next to her
 she comes in asking for ser rodrick and maester willewyn
 you do not have to i know where she is
 yes
 i did not run you need better guards
 he did i hope he comes back soon i aremember how happy he was to see me when he sees you his heart will probably stop
 everyone who knew his face is dead
 they say you killed joffrey did you
 me too i was angry when i heard someone else had done it however long my list got he was always first
 of people i am going to kill
 it is a long story i i amagine yours is too
 mine neither but our stories are not over yet
 arya brans home too
 i saw you at the crossroads
 i see quite a lot now
 i thought you might go to kings landing
 why would you go back there
 who else is on your list
 where did you get this
 littlefinger he is here
 why would he give you a dagger
 why
 the cutthroat after your fall
 someone havery wealthy wanted me dead
 it does not matter
 i do not want it
 it is wasted on a cripple
 i did next to nothing
 i am not a  
 dragonstone
 soon they will come back to me
 what happened
 many things
 it is all right
 so this is it all well ever need
 the children of the forest made these
 a havery long time ago
 no
 doing what fighting each other
 because the enemy is areal it is always been areal
 no i do not think i can
 my people would not accept a southern ruler not after everything they havet suffered
 what is it
 that is havery good to hear
 you will want to discuss this amongst yourselves perhaps  
 we still have the largest army
 call grey worm and the unsullied back we still have enough ships to carry the dothraki to the mainland commit to the blockade of kings landing we have a plan it is still the right plan
 if i have underestimated our enemies  
 enough with the clever plans
 we have discussed this
 a smart one
 i would never presume to  
 what do you think i should do
 but if you use them to melt castles and burn cities you are not different you are just more of the same
 do not go where your enemy leads you
 and do not  
 nice sword havery nice dagger
 it is been awhile since i have trained
 he did not beat the hound you did i want to train with you
 move aside podrick
 i would not cut you do not worry
 who taught you to do that
 dragonstone
 who
 i think she has a good heart
 there is no time for that i saw the night king davos i looked into his eyes how many men do we have in the north to fight him 10000 less
 what
 ser davos lord snow
 it does not matter
 of course
 i am a bastard my mother and father were not married
 we do not have marriage in naarth so the concept of a bastard does not exist
 why did you leave your homeland
 i am sorry
 she bought me from my master and set me free
 i serve my queen because i want to serve my queen because i believe in her
 then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune
 i know it all of us who came with her from essos we believe in her she is not our queen because she is the daughter of some king we never knew she is the queen we chose
 is that a greyjoy ship
 sansa is she all right
 we heard your uncle attacked your fleet we thought you were dead
 your sister
 the queen is gone
 all of the gold is safely through the gates of kings landing
 we need to get the last of these wagons over the blackwater rush before nightfall if the head of the line is ambushed the tail will never be able to areinforce in time
 with your permission flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility
 ser jaime
 dickon
 and
 come on your fathers not here
 they did not deserve to die but lady olenna chose to betray the queen and support the targaryen girl so here we are
 men shit themselves when they die did not they teach you that at fancy lad school
 what
 spears and shields spears and shields
 in line now
 spears armed
 i am not abandoning my army
 we can hold them off
 hold the line
 knock
 loose
 go get it then
 come on
 your peoplecan not fight
 come on you fucker
 flee you i hadiot
 you fucking i hadiot
 what the fuck were you doing back there
 you saw the dragon between you and her
 listen to me cunt till i get what i am owed a dragon does not get to kill you you do not get to kill you only i get to kill you
 you are fucked
 no i do not dragons are where our partnership ends i am not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on kings landing
 best well jump back in that river
 step forward my lord
 i already have a queen
 there are no easy choices in war say what you will about your sister she was born in westeros has lived here all her life you on the other hand you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader one with no ties to this land an army of savages at her back
 perhaps he could take the black your grace whatever else he is he is a true soldier he would be invaluable at the wall
 you will have to kill me too
 who are you
 i am dickon tarley son of randyll tarley
 i will not
 i meant what i said i am not here to put men in chains if that becomes an option many will take it i gave them a choice they made it
 i am not beheading anyone
 lord randyll tarley dickon tarley i daenerys of house targaryen first of my name breaker of chains and mother of dragons sentence you to die
 my lord
 we have not done a full counting
 they are not the same as our men but theyll fight if they are well paid which they will be
 so what do we do sue for peace i sit on her fathers throne the father you betrayed and murdered and in her mind she is winning what sort of offer do you think shed make
 he did not
 i am not talking about father tyrion did not kill joffrey he had nothing to do with it
 it was olenna she confessed before she died
 after
 if you were olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to joffrey or tommen which one would margerey been better able to control which one would have made olenna the true ruler of the seven kingdoms she was telling the truth
 she is dead like her son her grandchildren her whole house and if we do not find a way out of this war well follow them
 they are beautiful are not they
 they are not beasts to me no matter how big they get how terrifying to everyone else they are my children
 no
 and i have fewer enemies today than i did yesterday
 no i am not
 thousands
 ser davos gets carried away
 this man says he is your friend khaleesi
 your grace
 i served with your father he was a great man
 i would not be here if i hadnt i areturn to your service my queen if you will have me
 ext winterfell
 i put havery little stock in it myself prophecies of doom are never in short supply especially when winter comes
 the north has dulled many good maesters wits i am not sure if it is the cold the drink or the company
 it is a bit much still we ought to  
 do you know him
 and
 perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind
 everyone in westeros trusts and arespects you if you tell people the threat is areal theyll believe it if you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall theyll do it and if you tell every maester in the citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night they may find something that let us us defeat the army of the dead for good
 that does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples
 we will write to maester wolkan at winterfell for clarification i promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another
 that will be all tarley
 do not forget the prophet lodock that promised the drowned god would rise up and destroy aegon the conquerer
 i am afraid so
 i do not have the heart to tell him yet he is a good lad
 all rulers demand that people bend the knee it is why they are rulers she gave tarley a choice a man who had taken up arms against her what else could she do
 i am her hand not her head ican not make her decisions for her
 it is what i told myself when i watched them beg for mercy i am not the one doing it as the pitch of their screams rose higher i am not the one doing it when their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the thone room i am not the one doing it
 and she never will be with the right counsel you need to find a way to make her listen
 jon snow
 it is a sealed scroll for the king in the north
 nothing good
 i am happy for you you do not look happy
 the wall has kept them out for thousands of years presumably  
 you said you do not have enough men
 and give the country to cersei as soon as i march away she marches in
 i do not think she will come see the dead at my invitation
 i thought that was what we are trying to avoid
 is that possible
 bring one of these things down to kings landing and show her the truth
 the only person she listens to is jaime he may listen to me
 i can smuggle you in but if the goldcloaks were to arecognize you i am warning you i am not a fighter
 fair point how do you propose to find one
 you asked me to find a cure so i could serve you allow me to serve you
 they would not follow ser jorah
 youcan not lead a raid beyond the wall you are not in the nights watch anymore you are king in the north
 i have not given you permission to leave
 the king in the north should stay in the north we did not choose you to rule us my lady but perhaps we should have
 you are havery kind my lords but jon is our king he is doing what he thinks is best
 he did not he trusted you to hold it for him
 these are mother and fathers chambers
 nothing
 what
 you always liked nice things it made you feel better than everyone
 they were insulting jon and you sat there and listened
 their opinions are i amportant to you
 not if they lose their heads first
 and if jon does not come back you will need their support so you can work together to give you what you areally want
 you are thinking it right now you do not want to be but the thought just would not go away
 my lady
 last time i was here you killed my son with wildfire
 you are not staying here
 what if someone takes the boat
 we do not have time for this we should be preparing the city for a siege the dothraki are coming
 i seem to arecall them giving you a bit of trouble as well
 why down here
 today might be the day i kill you by accident
 i will leave you to it
 you made me look like a complete fool i thought i had surprise you by hitting casterly rock but you were three steps ahead of me you abandoned the family home completely unsentimental father would have been proud
 listen to me  
 it would take you awhile with a sparring sword
 what do you want
 you want cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself
 i thought you might still be rowing
 were not you worried about the goldcloaks
 anybody give you any trouble
 do not be so sure safety is never a permanent state of affairs bad things are coming
 i think you need to understand  
 you should know what you are heading into
 i have been getting aready i never knew what for but i have always known i had know it when it comes
 i do not know much about swinging swords but this  
 who should i say i am
 you there
 is that your boat
 the docks are that way
 still five gold dragons
 you must be even older than you look 15
 apiece
 what is in the boat
 wine
 i like wine
 come and have a look
 what
 i had hurry to your favorite establishment or you will put a whole in that chainmail
 i areally would not try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you
 where did you get that scar
 we was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back
 arrangement you gonna arrange to pay us more than queen cersei
 hell do
 ser jaime
 he is hand of the queen why are you here
 what did our brother have to say
 to discuss a surrender
 she just won a great victory why would she want a truce now
 are you going to punish him
 bronn
 you let it happen why
 who will you say is the father
 people would not like that
 the lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep
 were leaving today the kings got a lot on his mind
 he does not need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king
 you are just clovis a smith who is come to pay his arespects before he heads off to work at the winterfell forges
 begging your pardon your grace
 yet again
 it is gendry your grace i am robert baratheons son bastard son
 our fathers trusted each other why should not we
 i met yours in my shop
 you are a lot shorter
 all i ever knew was they fought together and won ser davos told me where you are going your grace and why let me come with you
 no but i am a fighter and he would not be needing a smith with a sword like that
 well that is a problem
 he can handle himself
 as my father used to say it is better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the arest of your life
 yeah nobody mind me all i have ever done is live to a ripe old age
 this is the coin the slaver gave me when i suggested he free us and pay us aremember
 take it with you you will bring it back our queen needs you
 your grace i  
 but i have grown used to him
 heave
 no
 guess how many windows are in the great sept of baelor
 that is true this high septon meynard he arecorded everything he even arecorded his own bowel movements what does annulment mean
 meynard says here that he issued an anullment for prince rhaegar and aremarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in dorne is that a common thing  
 steps that number was steps
 are you sure you want to do this you always wanted to be a maester
 i found it my lord
 are you sure this is the only copy at winterfell
 lady stark thanks you for your service
 is not it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this
 how many queens are there now
 and you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother
 how many men did you bring
 the big woman
 i will be staying behind i am a liability out there as you well know
 you areally want to go out there again
 my scouts found them a mile south of the wall said they were on their way here
 they want to go beyond the wall too
 do not trust them do not trust any of them
 thoros
 ser jorah mormont  
 you are a fucking mormont like the last lord commander
 he hunted us like animals
 here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same areason
 it does not matter what we think our areasons are
 for fucks sake will you shut your hole are we coming with you or not
 is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die
 how can we be
 beyond the wall
 ever been north before
 beautiful eh i can breath again down south the air smells like pig shit
 i have been to winterfell
 how do you live up here how do you keep your balls from freezing off
 there is not another woman within 100 miles of here
 this one is maybe not so smart
 good that is more i amportant than being smart
 she will only fight beside us if i bend the knee
 are you still mad at us boy
 priestess i will admit it is a subtle distinction
 i wanted to be one of you i wanted to join the brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave do you know what she did to me she strapped me down on a bed she stripped me naked  
 was she naked too
 yes thank you i know that
 she wanted to kill me they would have killed me if it was not for davos  
 i am not whinging
 this ones been killed six times you do not hear him bitching about it
 the first time i went north of the wall was with your father
 i was a prisoner of the wildlings but we avenged him i want you to know that every mutineer found justice
 i hate that he died that way my father was the most honorable man i ever met he was good all the way through and he died on the executioners block
 i heard
 i am glad he did not capture you
 your father gave me this sword he changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf but it is still long claw
 but you are back and it is been in your family for centuries it is not right for me to have it
 i am not his son
 i forfeited the right to claim this sword it is yours may it serve you well and your children after you
 i aremember
 i looked up and he is standing right here smiling down at me i knew what i was doing was against the rules but he was smiling so i knew it was not wrong the rules were wrong i was doing what i was meant to be doing and he knew it now he is dead killed by the lannisters with your help
 that is your pretty handwriting septa mordane used to crack my knuckles because i could not write as well as you robb i write to you today with heavy heart our good king robert is dead killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt  
 father has been charged with treason he conspired with roberts brothers against my beloved joffrey and tried to steal his throne the lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort i beg you come to kings landing swear fealty to king joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of lannister and stark your faithful sister sansa
 did they with a knife at your throat did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop
 so was i i would have let them kill me before i betrayed my family
 and you were stupid enough to believe them i aremember you standing on that platform with joffrey and cersei when they dragged father too the block i aremember the pretty dress you were wearing i aremember the fancy way you did your hair
 i was there standing in the crowd near baelors statue
 i wanted to
 i did not betray him i did not betray robb i did not betray our entire family for my beloved joffrey
 i was training
 oh i do not know about that i can i amagine quite a lot
 i guess well never know
 i do not know yet
 you are scared are not you what are you scared of you did not commit any crimes no ones going to hang you
 are you scared i will show it to jon and hell be angry no that is not jon hell understand you were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked lannisters
 the northern lords will aread it they would not think much of lady sansa if they knew how she did cerseis bidding what would little lyanna mormont say she is younger than you were when you wrote this are you going to say but i was just a child
 sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things i will go with anger
 fuck off
 i do not give two shits about wildlings
 gingers are beautiful we are kissed by fire just like you
 did you trip into the fire when you were a baby
 ever since you have been mean
 i do not think you are truly mean you have sad eyes
 dick
 ah dick i like it
 nope it is pussy for me i have a beauty waiting for me back at winterfell if i ever get back there yellow hair blue eyes tallest woman you have ever seen almost as tall as you
 you know her
 well not with her yet but i see the way she looks at me
 you do know her
 i want to make babies with her think of the great big monsters theyd conquer the world
 i am good at killing people
 who is that
 you knew him
 i serve the north
 the lord of light never spoke to me i do not know anything about him i do not know what he wants from me
 why
 that is all anyone can tell me i do not know so what is the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants
 so what are you fighting for
 but we all die
 i am the shield that guards the arealms of men
 aye maybe that is enough
 a mountain like an arrowhead
 were getting close
 i honestly do not
 oh i have been heroic on occasion
 i do not want you to be a hero heroes do stupid things and they die drogo jorah dario even this jon snow they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist bravest thing
 jon snows not in love with me
 oil
 how many barrels
 get 500 more
 i still enjoy it when they call me my lord
 if we live that long men without cocks you would not find me fighting in an army if i had no cock what is left to fight for
 i spent my life around soldiers what do you think they spend that gold on
 not without a cock you do not
 yet your brother 
 i think were about to be the downtrodden
 cover that wall
 how many people live here
 that is more people than the entire north crammed into that why would anyone want to live that way
 why is not she with them
 and the arest of them
 including our brother
 if anything goes wrong kill the silver haired bitch first then our brother then the bastard who calls himself king
 dragons do not understand the difference between what is theirs and what is not land livestock children letting them roam free around a city was a problem
 maybe it still is
 i have been sent to escort you all to the meeting
 i never thought i had see you again my lord
 hard to blame you
 i am glad you are alive
 
 what is in there
 i thought you were dead
 i was only trying to protect her
 she is alive arya
 winterfell
 the only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way
 here we are the heroes of blackwater bay strange place for a areunion
 i do not think i am anyones lord anymore podrick save the titles for ser bronn of the blackwater
 you have been thinking about our new queen
 do not you worry about me i am doing all right looking after myself
 i put yourself at risk i amportant difference it is your head queen cerseis offered a bag of gold for it is not mine now thanks to me she is got two traitors heads coming right through her door she can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes all thanks to ser bronn of the fucking blackwater if that is not looking after myself i do not know what is
 yeah you too
 anyone touches it i will kill you first
 come on pod let us you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk eh
 you might
 and some clegane cunt to help them see it through
 where is she
 did not travel with you
 we have been here for some time
 we are all facing a unique
 i think we ought to begin with larger concerns
 do you aremember when we discussed dwarf jokes his was not even good he explained it at the end never explain it always ruins it
 perhaps you ought to sit down
 sit down or leave
 so instead we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the arest of our days
 then why are we here
 i i amagine for most of them it would be an i amprovement
 i do not think it is serious at all i think it is another bad joke if my brother jaime has informed me correctly you are asking me for a truce
 that is all pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt or while you solidify and expand your position hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you areturn and march on my capital with four times the men
 the word of a would be usurper
 we can destroy them by burning them
 there is only one war that matters the great war and it is here
 how many
 can they swim
 good i am taking the iron fleet back to the iron islands
 i have been around the world i have seen everything things you could not i amagine and this this is the only thing i have ever seen that terrifies me
 he is right to be afraid and a coward to run if those things come for us there will be no kingdoms to rule everything we suffered will have been for nothing everything we lost will have been for nothing the crown accepts your truce until the dead are defeated they are the true enemy
 in areturn the king
  i would never ask it of you you would never agree to it and if you did i would trust you even less than i do now i ask it only of ned starks son i know ned starks son
 then there is nothing left to discuss the dead will come north first enjoy dealing with them we will deal with whatever is left of you
 it is been good to see you i i amagine the next time will be across a battlefield
 yes and i am not looking forward to seeing more of them but i am loyal to the queen and you are loyal to sansa and her dolt brother
 fuck loyalty
 and tell her what
 i am grateful for your loyalty but my dragon died so that we could be here if it is all for nothing then he died for nothing
 i am pleased you bent the knee to our queen
 that is indeed a problem the more i ammediate problem is that were fucked
 only one everyone stays here and i go and talk to my sister
 i do not want cersei to murder me either i could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble
 she will definitely murder you i go see my sister
 kings landing portico
 at her until she kicked me out she thinks i was an i hadiot to trust you a lot of people seem to think that actually
 i suppose we should say goodbye one i hadiot to another
 i should not be surprised i suppose she is your kind of woman a foreign whore who does not know her place
 so you bring her here with her pet northerner whom you have convinced to bow down before her
 and now you have got them both working towards the same goal the goal you have worked towards your entire life
 the destruction of this family
 you killed our father
 oh poor little man your papa was mean to you do you have any i hadea what you did when you fired that crossbow you left us open you laid us bare for the vultures and the vultures came and tore us apart you may not have killed joffrey but you killed myrcella you killed tommen no one would have touched them if father 
 i will not hear it not from you
 i will not hear it
 if it were not for me you had have a motherif it were not for me you had have a father
 i will not
 it does not matter your love does not matter your feelings do not matter i do not care why you did what you did i only care what it cost us it cost us our future
 not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction
 what did you hope for to make jon snow submit to your queen
 but eventually you want everyone to bend the knee to her
 why
 you said shed destroy kings landing
 that is the difference between you i do not care about checking my worst i ampulses i do not care about making the world a better place hang the world
 you are pregnant
 no one is less happy about this than i am
 this place was the beginning of the end for my family  a dragon is not a slave they were terrifying extraordinary they filled people with wonder and awe and we locked them in here they wasted away they grew small and we grew small as well we were not extraordinary without them we were just like everyone else
 ican not have children
 the witch who murdered my husband
 you were right from the beginning if i had trusted you everything would be different
 ican not forget what i saw north of the wall and ican not pretend that cersei would not take back half the country the moment i march north
 
 the north
 it is not easy for ravens to fly in these storms perhaps jon tried to send word earlier
 ican not believe hed surrender the northern crown without consulting you
 i have heard gossip that the dragon queen is quite beautiful
 jon is young and unmarried daenerys is young and unmarried
 an alliance makes sense together theyd be difficult to defeat he was named king
 you are family too would arya areally murder her own sister
 only by areputation they worship the god of death i believe i never trust godly men
 she is your sister
 why did she come to winterfell
 why did she unearth the letter cersei made you write
 and after she murders you what does she become
 dragonstone map room
 and the unsullied we can sail with them to white harbor meet the dothraki here on the kingsroad then ride together to winterfell
 it is your decision your grace but if were going to be allies in this war it is i amportant for the northerners to see us as allies if we sail to white harbor together i think it sends a better message
 dragonstone throne room
 can i speak with you
 what you did in kings landing what you said you could have lied to cersei about bending the knee to daenerys you risked everything to tell an enemy the truth
 you have always known what was right even when we were all young and stupid you always knew every step you take it is always the right step
 not compared to me you have not
 i always wanted to do the right thing be the right kind of person but i never knew what that meant it always seemed like there is like there was an i ampossible choice i had to make stark or greyjoy
 he was
 i did
 but the things i have done
 when i was ramsays prisoner yara tried to save me she is the only one who tried to save me  she needs me now
 the shores of kings landing
 all of us chose to follow yara we left the iron islands for yara she would never leave one of us behind were not leaving her behind
 she is not dead
 she is our queen
 i did i ran from my uncle
 were done with all that
 yara did she made a pledge were going to find her and were going to set her free
 he needs to shut his mouth
 oh yes
 stay down or i will kill you
 not for me for yara
 kings landing exterior
 the great hall of winterfell
 it is not what i want it is what honor demands
 that i defend my family from those who would harm us that i defend the north from those who would betray us
 you stand accused of murder you stand accused of treason how do you answer these charges lord baelish
 lady sansa forgive me i am a bit confused
 i did it to protect you
 whatever your aunt
 i know of no such letter
 i deny it none of you were there to see what happened none of you knows the truth
 you said i did warn you not the trust me
 lady sansa i have known you since you were a girl i have protected you
 if we could speak alone i can explain everything
 sansa please
 give me a chance to defend myself i deserve that
 i am lord protector of the vale and i command you to escort me safely back to the eyrie
 sansa i beg you i loved your mother since the time i was a boy
 i loved you more than anyone
 when you brought me back to winterfell you told me there is no justice in the world not unless we make it thank you for all your many lessons lord baelish i will never forget them
 an interior courtyard in kings landing
 itll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train
 ser jaime
 my lords i need a moment with my brother
 what are you doing
 expedition north i always knew you were the stupidest lannister the starks and targaryens have united against us and you want to fight alongside them are you a traitor or an i hadiot
 i will say whatever i need to say to ensure the survival of our house you expect me to trust the man who murdered our father
 i saw it burn if dragonscan not stop them if dothraki and unsullied and northmencan not stop them how will our armies make a difference
 and i intend to stay amongst the living let the stark boy and his new queen 
 our child will rule westeros
 the monsters are areal the white walkers the dragons the dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young they are all areal so be it let the monsters kill each other and while they battle in the north we take back the lands that belong to us
 and then we rule
 the targaryens and the starks already want to kill us all most of them will die in the north
 how many dragons did you see at the pit
 what happened to the third
 she came here with her dragons and her dothraki and her unsullied she came here to show us all her power no something happenedthe dragons are vulnerable
 no we have something better we have the iron bank you should have listened more when father 
 do you areally think euron greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the iron islands do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen
 and you conspired with tyrion the man who murdered our father without telling me your queen
 you met with him in secret without my consent you planned to promote my enemies interests that is the definition of conspiracy
 and that will be treason
 disobeying your queen
 i told you no one walks away from me
 there is one more yet to come
 i do not believe you
 montage of kings landing at night
 come in
 i was not sure if you had aremember me
 you helped us get beyond the wall you are a good man
 i became the three eyed raven
 i can see things that happened in the past i can see things happening now all over the world why did you come to winterfell
 he is on his way back to winterfell with daenerys targaryen you you saw this in a vision
 he needs to know the truth
 about himself no one knows no one but me jon is not areally my fathers son he is the son of rhaegar targaryen and my aunt
 dornish bastards are named sand
 are you certain
 flashback
 father smith warrior mother maiden crone stranger i am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days
 boat interior
 flashback
 boat interior
 he needs to know we need to tell him
 are you all right
 you did the right thing
 i am just the executioner you passed the sentence you are the lady
 i was never going to be as good a lady as you so i had to be something else i never could have survived what you survived
 i believe that is the nicest thing you have ever said to me
 in winter we must protect ourselves look after one another
 i miss him
 the godswood of winterfell
 it is a long way down
 i can see movement watch on the tree line
 come on run run
 you should consider yourself lucky at least your balls would not freeze off
 because i have balls and you do not
 winterfell  front gate
 you are a man
 where is arya
 queen daenerys of house targaryen my sister sansa stark the lady of winterfell
 winterfell is yours your grace
 he is one of them now the wall has fallen the dead march south
 as soon as we heard about the wall i called all our banners to aretreat to winterfell lord umber when can we expect your people to arrive
 and my lord
 you will have as many as we can spare hurry back to last hearth and bring your people here
 at once your grace
 a lord nothing at all
 not i amportant we named you king in the north
 you did my lady it was the honor of my life i will always be grateful for your faith but when i left winterfell i told you we need allies or we will die i have brought those allies home to fight alongside us i had a choice keep my crown or protect the north i chose the north
 i know i know our people have not been friends in the past but we must fight together now or die
 whatever they want
 sorry 'bout that
 aye
 my lord my lady
 the lady of winterfell has a nice ring to it
 last time we spoke was at joffreys we hadding miserable affair
 apologies for leaving like that
 we both survived
 i am sure you were not thrilled to hear the lannister armys marching north you have every right to be fearful of my sister no one fears her more than i do but i promise you will be safe 
 she did
 she has something to live for now i believe she wants to survive
 you used to be taller
 how did you survive a knife through the heart
 you still have it
 have you ever used it
 valyrian steel
 too heavy for me
 she does not like your queen does she
 she is the smartest person i have ever met
 you
 yeah i am her family too
 your grace i am afraid i bring terrible news the dead have broken through the wall
 eurons ship
 but were family the last greyjoys left in the world the last ones with balls anyway
 i have got a crew full of mutes it gets lonely at sea
 mm
 then i will sail the iron fleet somewhere else
 ared keep  great hall
 yes your grace a few died in transit
 horses
 and elephants
 that is disappointing i was told the golden company had elephants
 in any event you are most welcome here in kings landing captain strickland
 am i most welcome here
 good as a true friend and an honored guest
 after the war that was our agreement
 you want a whore buy one you want a queen earn her
 i have given her justice an army and the iron fleet yet she gives me no sign of affection my heart is nearly broken
 they were lesser men
 burnt up some of my favorite boys
 and william
 yeah tall handsome william
 i am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon
 nearly killed it
 that boy eddie
 that is him came back with his face burnt right off he is got no eyelids now
 all right can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now
 you are kidding me
 sorry ladies another time perhaps
 poor girl the pox will take her within the year
 the queens brothers made promises to you and broke them her grace wants to arectify their mistake
 that was ser jaimes doing not hers when queen cersei wants something she pays in advance and in gold several chests of it in fact waiting for you in a wagon just outside
 she has other plans for the targaryen girl
 our queens brothers are unlikely to survive their northern adventures but in the event that they do 
 that fucking family
 i wanted those elephants
 you are insulting my late husband
 robert had a different whore every night but he still did not know his way around a womans body
 you enjoy risking your neck do not you
 you are not boring i will give you that
 you might be the most arrogant man i have ever met i like that
 i am going to put a prince in your belly
 theons ships
 we can take our home back
 daenerys will need somewhere to aretreat if theycan not hold the north somewhere the deadcan not go
 you want to go to winterfell to fight for the starks go what is dead may never die
 but kill the bastards anyway
 welcome back my lady if you had follow me
 one of the better sigils beats an onion anyway
 not so long ago the starks and the karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield jon snow brought peace to the houses
 her gratitude is lovely but that is not my point the northmen are loyal to jon snow not to her they do not know her the free folk do not know her i have been up here a while and i am telling you they are stubborn as goats you want their loyalty you have to earn it
 a proposal is what i am proposing on the off chance that we survive the night king what if the seven kingdoms for once in their whole shit history were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man
 you overestimate our influence jon and daenerys do not want to listen to lonely old men
 not as old as him
 of course she does arespect is how the young keep us at a distance so we do not aremind them of an unpleasant truth
 nothing lasts
 your sister does not like me
 she does not need to be my friend but i am her queen if shecan not arespect me 
 only eighteen goats and eleven sheep
 the dragons are barely eating
 they do not like the north
 i do not know how to ride a dragon
 what if he does not want me to
 what do i hold onto
 you have completely ruined horses for me
 no one would find us
 it is cold up here for a southern girl
 do not be afraid
 he is here
 you are saying you are good is that it
 you know who makes weapons for the wildlings cripples and cocksuckers which one are you
 i heard you were here you left me to die
 you are a cold little bitch are not you guess that is why you are still alive
 yeah thanks so have you
 thanks so do you
 stay close to that forge then
 do not call me that
 heres my wish
 what do you need something like this for
 you already have a sword what is that
 you do not know any other rich girls
 come in
 house glover will stand behind house stark as we have for a thousand years is not that what he said
 the king in the north
 you did not tell me you were going to abandon your crown
 and a targaryen queen
 do you have any faith in me at all
 she will be a good queen for all of us she is not her father
 did you bend the knee to save the north or because you love her
 so you are the man
 the one who saved ser jorah when no one else could
 i will have to make some changes in the citadel when i take my throne a great service merits a great areward
 well there must be something i could give you
 for what crime
 and also a sword
 from my family it is been in house tarly for generations
 not randyll tarly
 i offered to let him aretain his lands and titles if he bent the knee he arefused
 your brother stood with your father
 what are you doing out here
 no no you are his brother should not you tell him
 sam
 were you hiding from me
 what are you doing in winterfell or did you aread every book in the citadel already
 she is good
 do not you know
 daenerys she executed my father and brother they were her prisoners
 i am so sorry we need to end this war
 well i have executed men who disobeyed me
 i was not a king
 i gave up my crown sam
 i am not talking about the king in the north i am talking about the king of the bloody seven kingdoms
 what are you talking about
 my father was the most honorable man i ever met you are saying he lied to me all my life
 she should not be
 it is the truth you gave up your crown to save your people would she do the same
 i have always had blue eyes
 the umber boy
 his armys between us and winterfell were on foot
 if the horses last well get there before the dead
 winterfell
 who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat who sat down on the iron throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor
 your sister pledged to send her army north
 i do not see an army i see one man with one hand it appears your sister lied to me
 she has euron greyjoys fleet and 20000 fresh troops the golden company from essos bought and paid for even if we defeat the dead she will have more than enough to destroy the survivors
 i promised to fight for the living i intend to keep that promise
 like you knew your sister
 perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him right up to the moment he slits my throat
 do you want me to apologize i would not we were at war everything i did i did for my house and my family i had do it all again
 so why have you abandoned your house and family now
 this is about survival
 but i know ser jaime he is a man of honor i was his captor once but when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me ser jaime defended me and lost his hand because of it
 you vouch for him
 you would fight beside him
 i trust you with my life if you trust him with yours we should let him stay
 we need every man we can get
 thank you your grace
 either you knew cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise or you did not know at all which makes you either a traitor or a fool
 not for the first time
 i suspect one of you will be wearing this before it is all over
 you make my weapon yet
 you should make mine first and make sure it is stronger than this
 it is going to be safer down in the crypt you know
 no but 
 i have done my share
 i did some of them
 a few that was enough
 bad areally bad
 even a smiths apprentice can do better than areally bad what do they look like what do they smell like how do they move how hard are they to kill
 i know death
 i look forward to seeing this one
 i will get right on it
 you were not sorry then you were protecting your family
 you still would be if you hadnt pushed me out of that window and i would still be brandon stark
 no i am something else now
 i am not angry at anyone
 you would not be able to help us in this fight if i let them murder you first
 how do you know there is an afterwards
 yes here we are
 and the masses arejoice
 she is your new queen too
 and she is different
 you are sure about her
 she did not seem sure about you
 hmm
 was she lying about the baby too
 she is always been good at using the truth to tell lies i would not be too hard on yourself she is fooled me more than anybody
 she never fooled you you always knew exactly what she was and you loved her anyway
 a girls mouth around 
 my cock
 maybe after i am dead i will march down to kings landing and rip her apart
 ser jaime
 he is come a long way
 i am sure you will teach him i have been told you are commanding the left flank
 it is
 if we can keep a tight formation we might be able to beat them back
 what are you doing
 i think you know
 we have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me not once
 no
 i came to winterfell because i am not the fighter i used to be but i had be honored to serve under your command if you will have me
 forgive me khaleesi
 many things
 but you did forgive despite my failures when i heard you had named tyrion your hand it broke my heart
 you made the right choice
 i did not his mouth hardly stopped moving between volantis and meereen it was all i could do not to throw him in the sea
 he is made mistakes serious mistakes
 you are advising me to forgive the man who stole your position
 the moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field we should shut the gates
 lady sansa i was hoping we could speak alone
 brienne has been loyal to me always i trust her more than anyone
 tyrion is a good man he was never anything but decent towards me
 i asked him to be my hand because he was good and intelligent and ruthless when he had to be he never should have trusted cersei
 i thought he knew his sister
 ours certainly have been
 we have other things in common we have both known what it means to lead people who are not inclined to accept a womans rule and we have both done a damn good job of it from what i can tell
 he loves you you know that
 men do stupid things for women they are easily manipulated
 i should have thanked you the moment you arrived that was a mistake
 who was the first
 and what happens afterwards we defeat the dead we destroy cersei what happens then
 what about the north it was taken from us and we took it back and we said we had never bow to anyone else again what about the north
 what is it
 my queen
 she only has a few ships and she could not sail them here so she is sailing to the iron islands instead to take them back in your name
 i want to fight for winterfell lady sansa if you will have me
 milord were not soldiers

 how long do we have
 the big woman still here
 we have dragonglass and valyrian steel
 but there are too many of them

 our enemy does not tire
 wecan not beat them in a straight fight
 the night king made them all they follow his command if he falls getting to him may be our best chance
 yes he will
 why what does he want
 that is what death is is not it forgetting being forgotten if we forget where we have been and what we have done were not men anymore just animals your memories do not come from books your stories are not just stories if i wanted to erase the world of men i had start with you
 his mark is on me

 you want us to use you as bait
 he would not be i will stay with him with the ironborn i took this castle from you let me defend you now
 when the time comes ser davos and i will be on the walls to give you the signal to light the trench
 your grace i have fought before i can do it again alongside the men and women risking their lives
 the dragons should give us an edge in the field
 dragonfire will stop him
 were all going to die

 you have had a strange journey
 i had like to hear about it
 if only we were trapped in a castle in the middle of winter with nowhere to go
 when daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here i am loyal to my queen i will fight for her until her enemies are defeated but when the war is over and she has won do you want to grow old in this place is there nothing else you want to do nothing else you want to see

 high in the halls of the kings who are gone jenny would dance with her ghosts the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most
 the ones whod been gone for so havery long
 spun away all her sorrow and pain and she never wanted to leave
 winterfell  outside front gate
 who is that
 my brother rhaegar everyone told me he was decent and kind he liked to sing gave money to poor children and he raped her
 they were married in secret after rhaegar fell on the trident she had a son robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out and lyanna knew it so the last thing she did as she bled to death on her birthing bed was give the boy to her brother ned stark to raise as his bastard
 that is i ampossible
 who told you this
 he saw it
 a secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend does not seem strange to you
 if it were true it would make you the last male heir of house targaryen you had have a claim to the iron throne
 path to winterfell
