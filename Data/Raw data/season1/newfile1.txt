[First scene opens with three Rangers riding through a tunnel, leaving the Wall, and going into the woods. (Eerie music in background) One Ranger splits off and finds a campsite full of mutilated bodies, including a child hanging from a tree branch. A birds-eye view shows the bodies arranged in a shield-like pattern. The Ranger rides back to the other two.]
WAYMAR ROYCE: What d’you expect? They’re savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they’re ripping each other to pieces.
WILL: I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
WAYMAR ROYCE: How close did you get?
WILL: Close as any man would.
GARED: We should head back to the wall.
ROYCE: Do the dead frighten you?
GARED: Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won’t trouble us no more.
ROYCE: You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
[GARED grumbles.]
WILL: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
ROYCE: It’s a good thing we’re not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don’t catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won’t say it again.
[WILL glares, but obeys. Sometime later, the three Rangers return to the campsite, which is now completely cleared.]
ROYCE: Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
WILL: They were here.
GARED: See where they went.
[The three look around, swords drawn. They hear the wind and eerie calls. GARED finds a red cloth in the snow.]
ROYCE: What is it?
GARED: It’s …
[As he speaks, a CREATURE with glowing blue eyes rises behind ROYCE. ROYCE turns, the CREATURE strikes. The scene shifts to WILL, who hears a man crying out. The three horses stampede past him. He turns and sees someone standing very still in the distance. The figure turns – it’s the child who had been suspended in the tree, now with glowing blue eyes. WILL turns and runs.
GARED is also fleeing, and we hear strange growls and catch glimpses of the CREATURE. Both terrified RANGERS stop, some distance apart, to catch their breath. WILL sees a CREATURE behead GARED. WILL sinks to his knees and the CREATURE tosses GARED’S head to him.]
[Blackout]
TITLE SEQUENCE[Riders from Winterfell come up behind a dazed WILL. The scene shifts to the castle, where BRAN is practicing archery and getting frustrated, under the eyes of JON SNOW and ROBB STARK. JON pats BRAN’S shoulder.]
JON: Go on. Father’s watching.
[We see NED and CATELYN STARK watching from above.]
JON: And your mother.
[Scene shifts to needlework practice with the girls inside the castle.]
SEPTA MORDANE (to SANSA): Fine work, as always. Well done.
SANSA: Thank you.
SEPTA MORDANE: I love the detail that you’ve managed to get in this corners. … Quite beautiful … the stitching …
[As she murmurs to SANSA about the embroidery, ARYA struggles with her needlework and listens to the arrows hitting and the male laughter outside.]
[Outside, BRAN tries and misses again. Everyone laughs.]
NED: And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.
JON: Don’t think too much, Bran.
ROBB: Relax your bow arm.
[BRAN pulls the arrow back. An arrow hits the bullseye. BRAN (still with his arrow), JON, and ROBB turn in surprise to see ARYA, who curtsies after her perfect shot. ROBB and JON laugh as Bran takes out after ARYA.]
JON/ROBB: Quick, Bran, faster!
[RODRICK CASSEL and THEON GREYJOY approach NED and CATELYN on the balcony.]
CASSEL: Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch.
[NED grimaces.]
NED: Get the lads to saddle their horses.
[THEON departs.]
CATELYN: Do you have to?
NED: He swore an oath, Cat.
CASSEL: The law is law, my lady.
NED: Tell Bran he’s coming, too.
[CASSEL nods and departs.]
CATELYN: Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
NED: He won’t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
[NED departs. In the courtyard, ROBB and JON gather the arrows. CATELYN turns and glares down on JON. He looks at her and walks away.]
ROBB: Lad, go run back and get the rest.
[Scene shifts, and we see WILL being taken to the block.]
WILL (muttering): White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.
[He and NED face each other.]
WILL: I know I broke my oath. And I know I’m a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I’m no coward. Tell them I’m sorry.
NED nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block. [NED draws Ice from a scabbard held by Theon.]
WILL (whispering): Forgive me, lord.
[NED bows his head over ICE.]
NED: In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …
JON (to BRAN): Don’t look away.
NED: King of the Andals and the First Men …
JON: Father will know if you do.
NED: Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.
[NED swings ICE and beheads WILL. BRAN does not look away.]
JON: You did well.
[He walks away. ROBB turns and puts his arm around BRAN and they go to their horses together. NED approaches BRAN.]
NED: You understand why I did it?
BRAN: Jon said he was a deserter.
NED: But do you understand why I had to kill him?
BRAN: Our way is the old way?
NED: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
BRAN: Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
NED: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
BRAN: So he was lying?
NED: A madman sees what he sees.
[Scene shifts to a dead stag’s head. The Winterfell men gather on the bridge They see a ravaged deer before them.]
JON: What is it?
THEON: Mountain lion?
NED: There are no mountain lions in these woods.
[With swords out, they begin to search. NED finds a dead direwolf with antlers through her throat. Her pups are whimpering around her.]
THEON: It’s a freak.
NED: It’s a direwolf.
[NED and CASSEL glance at each other.]
NED: Tough old beast.
[He pulls out the antlers.]
ROBB: There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
JON: Now there are five.
[Jon picks up a pup and offers it to BRAN.]
JON: You want to hold it?
BRAN: Where will they go? Their mother’s dead.
CASSEL: They don’t belong down here.
NED: Better a quick death. They won’t last without their mother.
THEON: Right. Give it here.
BRAN: NO!
ROBB (disgustedly to THEON): Put away your blade.
THEON: I take orders from your father, not you.
BRAN: Please, father!
NED: I’m sorry, Bran.
JON: Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
[Everyone looks at NED, BRAN with great hope.]
NED: You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
[BRAN cradles his pup as JON hands more pups to ROBB.]
BRAN (to JON): What about you?
JON: I’m not a Stark. Get on.
[JON walks away, pauses, and hears another whimper.]
ROBB: What is it?
[JON pulls up a white wolf pup.]
THEON: The runt of the litter. That one’s yours, Snow.
[Scene shifts to bells ringing at Kings Landing. In front of the Iron Throne, surrounded by druidical looking celebrants, lies the body of JON ARRYN. Up in the balcony, CERSEI watches the scene below as JAIME approaches.]
JAIME: As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you: You worry too much. It’s starting to show.
CERSEI: And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.
JAIME: There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We’re Lannisters. Lannisters don’t act like fools.
CERSEI: What if Jon Arryn told someone?
JAIME: But who would he tell?
CERSEI: My husband.
JAIME: If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.
CERSEI: You should be the Hand of the king.
JAIME: That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.
[Scene shifts to a raven approaching Winterfell. CATELYN crosses a busy courtyard and finds NED in the godswood.]
CATELYN: All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
NED: You have five northern children. You’re not an outsider.
CATELYN: I wonder if the old gods agree.
NED: It’s your gods with all the rules.
CATELYN: I am so sorry, my love.
NED: Tell me.
CATELYN: There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
NED: Your sister. The boy …
CATELYN: They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
NED: He’s coming this far North, there’s only one thing he’s after.
CATELYN: You can always say no, Ned.
[Scene shifts to the Winterfell great hall where a great banquet is being prepared.]
CATELYN: We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber. I’m told he reads all night.
MAESTER LUWIN: I’m told he drinks all night.
CATELYN: How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
LUWIN: We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we’ll find out.
CATELYN: In any case, candles.
[Scene shifts to Robb, Theon, and Jon getting barbered.]
JON: Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
THEON: It’s for the queen, I bet. I hear she’s [sleek as a mink?]
ROBB: I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
THEON: Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
ROBB: Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
[Scene shifts to the royal procession approaching Winterfell. Bran sees them from his perch high atop a castle wall and clambers nimbly down to tell everyone. CATELYN and LUWIN walk to the courtyard, passing BRAN’s wolf pup.]
CATELYN: Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!
BRAN: I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people!
CATELYN: How many times have I told you: No climbing!
BRAN: But he’s coming right now! Down our road!
CATELYN: I want you to promise me: No more climbing.
BRAN (looking down): I promise.
CATELYN: D’you know what?
BRAN: What?
CATELYN: You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
[BRAN runs off, followed by his wolf pup.]
[Scene shifts to grand entry of the king’s horses and men. ARYA, wearing a helm and cloak, pushes her way into a tall wagon for a better look. In rides JOFFREY, followed by the HOUND. The other Starks wait in a greeting line.]
CATELYN: Where’s Arya? Sansa, where’s your sister?
[More riders with banners. ARYA scoots past her parents to get in the receiving line.]
NED: Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA’s helm]
ARYA (pushing BRAN): Move!
[JOFFREY rides up, SANSA smiles at him, ROBB glares at JOFFREY. The HOUND pulls up his helm. The coach carrying CERSEI lumbers in, followed by KING ROBERT. All kneel. ROBERT heaves himself off his horse. NED looks shocked at the sight of his old friend, now fat and red-faced. ROBERT signals for all to rise and looks at NED.]
NED: Your Grace.
ROBERT: You’ve got fat.
[NED gives ROBERT a “What about you?” look. They start laughing.]
ROBERT: Cat!
CATELYN: Your Grace.
ROBERT: Nine years. Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
NED: Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.
[CERSEI and her other children descend from the coach.]
ARYA: Where’s the Imp?
SANSA: Will you shut up?
ROBERT: Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, you’re a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?
ARYA: Arya.
ROBERT (to BRAN) Ooh. Show us your muscles. You’ll be a soldier.
[JAIME removes his helm.]
ARYA: That’s Jaime Lannister. The queen’s twin brother.
SANSA: Would you please shut up.
[CERSEI approaches.]
NED: My queen.
CATELYN: My queen.
ROBERT: Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
CERSEI: We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.
ROBERT: Ned.
ARYA: Where’s the Imp?
[CERSEI, humiliated in front of all, walks back to JAIME.]
CERSEI: Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
[Scene changes to the crypt.]
NED: Tell me about Jon Arryn.
ROBERT: One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.
NED: We both did.
ROBERT: He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.
NED: Aye.
ROBERT: Don’t look at me like that. Not his fault I didn’t listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you’re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.
[NED kneels.]
NED: I’m not worthy of the honor.
ROBERT: I’m not trying to honor you. I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it’s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We’ll join our Houses.
[Scene changes to JAIME in the Winterfell settlement. We see Tyrion inside a whorehouse, swilling liquor and laughing as a woman pops into view after servicing him.]
TYRION: Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
ROS: Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?
TYRION: I did hear something about that.
ROS: And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
TYRION: And the other brother?
ROS: The queen has two brothers?
TYRION: There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one.
ROS: I hear they call him the Imp.
TYRION: I hear he hates that nickname.
ROS: Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it. I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
TYRION: Clever girl.
ROS: We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.
TYRION: Have you?
TYRION: The gods gave me one blessing.
[She climbs on TYRION. JAIME walks in without knocking.]
JAIME: Don’t get up.
ROS: M’lord.
TYRION: Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
JAIME: You’ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.
TYRION: She has odd cravings, our sister.
JAIME: A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people.
TYRION: I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.
JAIME: I thought you might say that. But since we’re short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown.
[JAIME leaves.]
TYRION: Close the door!
Scene changes to the Winterfell crypt, at Lyanna’s tomb. [Robert places a feather in the hand of her statue.]
ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
NED: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
ROBERT: She belonged with me.
[He touches Lyanna’s face.]
ROBERT: In my dreams, I kill him every night.
NED: It’s done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.
ROBERT: Not all of them.
[Scene shifts to Daenerys on a balcony in Pentos, across the Narrow Sea.]
VISERYS (off camera): Daenerys!
[He enters a large chamber.]
VISERYS: Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn’t he a gracious host?
DAENERYS: We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything.
VISERYS: Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman’s body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?
DAENERYS: No.
[VISERYS nods and starts to leave the chamber. He turns.]
VISERYS: When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.
[Daenerys turns and steps into a steaming hot bath with a despairing look on her face.]
MAID: It’s too hot, my lady.
[But DAENERYS keeps stepping deeper. The scene shifts to ILLYRIOS, DAENERYS, AND VISERYS outside the mansion, awaiting Khal Drogo.]
VISERYS: Where is he?
ILLYRIO: The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
[A host of Dothraki come riding up. Khal Drogo wheels his stallion into the front.]
ILLYRIO: (Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.
VISERYS (to DAENERYS) Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He’s a savage, of course, but he’s one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.
ILLYRIO: Come forward, my dear.
[KHAL DROGO watches as DAENERYS walks toward him. She does not hesitate and looks straight at him, although there is fear on her face. KHAL DROGO gazes at her and then leads his horsemen on a charge away.]
VISERYS: Where’s he going?
ILLYRIO: The ceremony is over.
VISERYS: But he didn’t say anything. Did he like her?
ILLYRIO: Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn’t like her, we’d know.
[The scene shifts to ILLYRIO, VISERYS, AND DAENERYS ON A GARDEN BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE SEA.]
ILLYRIO: It won’t be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
VISERYS: When will they be married?
ILLYRIO: Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
VISERYS: Is it true they lie with their horses?
ILLYRIO: I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo.
VISERYS: Do you take me for a fool?
ILLYRIO: I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I’ve given offense.
VISERYS: I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
DAENERYS (pleadingly) I don’t want to be his queen. I want to go home.
VISERYS: So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?
DAENERYS: I don’t know.
VISERYS: We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo’s army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took.
[He gives DAENERYS a brotherly kiss on the forehead and walks away. The scene shifts to a bedroom in Winterfell, where CATELYN is fixing SANSA’S hair.]
SANSA: Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?
CATELYN: Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
SANSA: He’s so handsome.
[CATELYN rolls her eyes.]
SANSA: When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
CATELYN: Hush now. Your father hasn’t even said yes.
SANSA: Why would he say no? He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
CATELYN: He’d have to leave home. He’d have to leave me. And so would you.
SANSA: You left your home to come here. And I’d be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
CATELYN: Sansa…
SANSA: Please, please. It’s the only thing I ever wanted.
[Scene shifts to the Winterfell banquet. Laughter, music, KING ROBERT getting bawdy with a wench. CATELYN and CERSEI watch, CATELYN embarrassed for CERSEI, who looks disgusted. Out in the courtyard, JON takes out his frustration on a fencing dummy. His uncle BENJEN rides up.]
BENJEN: Is he dead yet?
JON: Uncle Benjen!
[They hug.]
BENJEN: You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren’t you at the feast?
JON: Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
BENJEN: Well, you’re always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
JON: So take me with you when you go back.
BENJEN: Jon…
JON: Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.
BENJEN: The Wall isn’t going anywhere.
JON: I’m ready to swear your oath.
BENJEN: You don’t understand what you’d be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
JON: I don’t care about that.
BENJEN: You might, if you knew what it meant. … I’d better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We’ll talk later.
[BENJEN goes to the banquet.]
TYRION: Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch.
JON: What’re you doing back there?
TYRION (drinking): Preparing for a night with your family. I’ve always wanted to see the Wall.
JON: You’re Tyrion Lannister. The queen’s brother?
TYRION: My greatest accomplishment. You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?
[JON looks angry and turns away.]
TYRION: Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.
JON: Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
TYRION: And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.
JON: What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
TYRION: All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes.
[TYRION departs. JON picks up his sword and attacks the dummy with new ferocity.]
[The scene shifts back to the banquet, in full raucous swing. NED is off to himself; BENJEN comes up to him.]
NED: The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
BENJEN: Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.
NED: He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
BENJEN: The two he was with are still missing.
NED: A wildling ambush.
BENJEN: Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
NED: Winter is coming.
[ROBB approaches.]
ROBB: Uncle Benjen.
BENJEN: Robb boy. How are ye?
ROBB: I’m good.
[KING ROBERT gets even more bawdy with a wench.]
CATELYN (in desperation) Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
CERSEI: Yes. Lovely country.
[They observe SANSA.]
CATELYN: I’m sure it’s very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
[SANSA approaches and smiles shyly at CERSEI.]
CERSEI: Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?
SANSA: Thirteen, Your Grace.
CERSEI: You’re tall. Still growing?
SANSA: I think so, Your Grace.
CERSEI: And have you bled yet?
SANSA (discomfited): No, Your Grace.
CERSEI: And your dress. Did you make it?
[SANSA nods yes.]
CERSEI: Such talent. You must make something for me.
[SANSA departs.]
CERSEI (to CATELYN): I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
CATELYN: I hear the same.
CERSEI: Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever.
[SANSA and JOFFREY catch each other’s eye. JOFFREY smiles at her and she turns to her friend.]
[JAIME and NED meet up. JAIME blocks their path.]
NED: Your pardon.
JAIME: I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it’s true.
NED: Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.
JAIME: I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.
NED: I don’t fight in tournaments.
JAIME: No? Getting a little old for it?
NED: I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do.
JAIME: Well said.
[ARYA flips food onto SANSA’s face.]
SANSA: Arya!
[CATELYN signals a laughing ROBB to deal with the girls. He hoists up ARYA.]
ROBB: Time for bed.
[The scene shifts to after the banquet. NED and CATELYN are in their bed.]
NED: I’m a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat’s nest they call a capital.
CATELYN: I won’t let him take you.
NED: The king takes what he wants. That’s why he’s king.
CATELYN: I’ll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.’
NED: How did he get so fat?
CATELYN: He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink.
[There’s a knock at the door.]
A VOICE: It’s Maester Luwin, my lord.
NED: Send him in.
LUWIN: Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.
[He hands CATELYN a sealed note.]
NED: Stay.
CATELYN: This was sent from the Eyrie. What’s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn’t been back there since her wedding.
[CATELYN reads the note, looks up in alarm, and then burns it.]
NED: What news?
CATELYN: She’s fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
NED: She’s fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn’t know what she’s saying.
CATELYN: Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son’s life, if she wasn’t certain her husband was murdered?
LUWIN: If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?
CATELYN: They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
LUWIN: The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark’s help. He’s the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.
CATELYN: He spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars. He owes him nothing. (To NED) Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand.
LUWIN: A different time. Different king.
[The scene shifts to the wild wedding celebration of KHAL DROGO and DAENERYS. Fighting and fornication. DAENERYS looks stricken at everything around her.]
VISERYS: When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
ILLYRIO: If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.
VISERYS: When?
ILLYRIO: When their omens favor war.
VISERYS: I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
[The sex and violence intensify. Two men fight to the death over a woman each is trying to rape. KHAL DROGO watches avidly.]
ILLYRIO: A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
[A knight in Westerosi garb appears. KHAL DROGO greets him in Dothraki. It is JORAH MORMONT, bearing books.]
JORAH: A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
DAENERYS: Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?
JORAH: Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.
[DANY is presented with a chest with three dragon eggs in it.]
ILLYRIO: Dragons’ eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.
DAENERYS: Thank you, Magister.
[KHAL DROGO rises and strides forward. DAENERYS follows him, looking sick with fear. The Dothraki crowd behind her as she goes. The KHAL leads her to a white mare.]
DAENERYS: She’s beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don’t know how to say ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.
JORAH: There is no word for ‘thank you’ in Dothraki.
[The KHAL puts DANY on her horse and mounts his.]
VISERYS: Make him happy.
[The scene shifts to the seaside at sunset. The KHAL begins to unwrap DANY’s dress. She is sobbing. He touches the tears on her face.]
KHAL DROGO: No.
DAENERYS: Do you know the Common Tongue?
KHAL DROGO: No.
DAENERYS: Is ‘no’ the only word that you know?
KHAL DROGO: No.
[He takes off her gown and bends her down.]
[The scene shifts to Winterfell. Tyrion and the Hound are seated outside the day after the banquet.]
THE HOUND: Rough night, Imp?
TYRION: If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.
THE HOUND: I didn’t pick you for a hunter.
TYRION: The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
THE HOUND: It’s not hunting if you pay for it.
[The king and Ned come into view.]
ROBERT: Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
NED: No, but I’m still better than you.
ROBERT: I know what I’m putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You’re a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I’ve got.
NED: I hope I’ll serve you well.
ROBERT: You will. And I’ll make sure you don’t look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let’s go kill some boar!
[The king’s party rides off, NED nodding goodbye to BRAN, whose wolf pup begins sniffing at his feet.]
BRAN: Come on, you.
[BRAN begins climbing, his wolf pup crying at the bottom of the castle wall. As he nears the top, he hears a woman and man moaning. Peering in the window, he sees CERSEI and JAIME having sex. CERSEI sees BRAN.]
CERSEI: Stop. STOP.
[JAIME runs and grabs BRAN at the window.]
JAIME: Are you completely mad?
CERSEI: He saw us.
JAIME: It’s all right. It’s all right.
CERSEI: He saw us!
JAIME: I heard you the first time. (To BRAN) Quite the little climber, aren’t you? How old are you, boy?
BRAN: Ten
.
JAIME: Ten.
[JAIME looks at CERSEI, who gazes back imploringly.]
JAIME: The things I do for love.
[He shoves BRAN out the window.]
/ BLACKOUT /
Daenerys on horseback looking at Drogo and his people.
Jorah Mormont: You need to drink, child... And eat.
Daenerys Targaryen: Isn't there anything else?
Jorah Mormont: The Dothraki have two things in abundance: grass and horses. People can't live on grass... In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. It murders all other grass. The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything. That's the way the world will end… It'll get easier.
Arriving at camp, Daenerys looks exhausted from riding.
Doreah: Khaleesi!
Irri: Your hands.
After Daenerys is escorted away, Jorah and Viserys are alone.
Jorah Mormont: We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.
Viserys Targaryen: I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
Jorah Mormont: As you wish, your Grace.
Viserys Targaryen: Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?
Jorah Mormont: Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
Viserys Targaryen: Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.
Joffrey finding Tyrion asleep in the dog’s pen of Winterfell.
Joffrey Baratheon: Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today.
Tyrion Lannister: Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
Joffrey Baratheon: What good will my sympathies do them?
Tyrion Lannister: None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
Joffrey Baratheon: The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
Tyrion Lannister: One word and I'll hit you again.
Joffrey Baratheon: I'm telling mother!
Tyrion Lannister: Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?
Joffrey Baratheon: You can't...
Tyrion Lannister: Do you understand?
Sandor Clegane: The Prince will remember that, little lord.
Tyrion Lannister: I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...
Tyrion walks from the courtyard to the dining hall where his family is eating breakfast.
Tyrion Lannister: Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.
Jaime Lannister: Little brother.
Tyrion Lannister: Beloved siblings.
Myrcella Baratheon: Is Bran going to die?
Tyrion Lannister: Apparently not.
Cersei Baratheon: What do you mean?
Tyrion Lannister: The Maester says the boy may live.
Cersei Baratheon: It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
Tyrion Lannister: Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
Cersei Baratheon: I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
Tyrion Lannister: Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.
Jaime Lannister: Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
Tyrion Lannister: And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
Cersei Baratheon: The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
Jaime Lannister: Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.
Tyrion Lannister: Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
Jaime Lannister: My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
Tyrion Lannister: My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.
In Bran’s room with Catelyn at his bedside, Cersei coming to console.
Cersei Baratheon: Please.
Catelyn Stark:  I would have dressed, your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon: This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.
Catelyn Stark: I never knew.
Cersei Baratheon:  It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
Catelyn Stark:  I am grateful..
Cersei Baratheon: Perhaps this time she'll listen.
Near the Smith in a courtyard of Winterfell.
Jaime Lannister: A sword for the wall?
Jon Snow: I already have one.
Jaime Lannister: Good man. Have you swung it yet?
Jon Snow: Of course I have.
Jaime Lannister:  At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.
Jon Snow: We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
Jaime Lannister: Is it "we" already? Have you taken your vows then?
Jon Snow: Soon enough.
Jaime Lannister: Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life.
Arya’s room, packing things for her trip to King’s Landing, having her direwolf assist her. Jon comes in to say goodbye before he leaves for the Night's Watch.
Arya Stark: Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. "My things weren't properly folded", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.
Jon Snow: It's good you've got help.
Arya Stark: Watch. Nymeria, gloves.
Jon Snow:  Impressive.
Arya Stark:  Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!
Jon Snow:  I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
Arya Stark:  A present?
Jon Snow:  Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
Arya Stark:  It's so skinny.
Jon Snow: So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.
Arya Stark: I can be quick.
Jon Snow:  You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
Arya Stark: I think so.
Jon Snow: First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.
Arya Stark:  I know which end to use.
Jon Snow:  I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know.
Arya Stark:  Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
Jon walks into Bran’s room, where Catelyn is still at his bedside.
Jon Snow:  I came to say goodbye to Bran.
Catelyn Stark:  You've said it.
Jon Snow:  I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.
Catelyn Stark: I want you to leave.
Eddard walks into the room, Jon kisses Brandon on the forehead and exits.
Catelyn Stark: 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
Eddard Stark:  I have no choice.
Catelyn Stark: That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.
Eddard Stark:  You can. You must.
In the courtyard, Jon prepping his horse to leave for the Wall.
Robb Stark: You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
Jon Snow:  You Starks are hard to kill.
Robb Stark: My mother?
Jon Snow:  She was very kind.
Robb Stark: Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.
Jon Snow:  It was always my color.
Robb Stark: Farewell, Snow.
Jon Snow:  And you, Stark.
At the split between the Kingsroad and the road that will take Benjen and Jon to the Wall.
Eddard Stark: There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.
Jon Snow: Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?
Eddard Stark: The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.
Stopping for rest along the Kingsroad. Robert has a mini table set up full of wine and food.
Robert Baratheon: Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
Eddard Stark:  I've half a mind to go with you.
Robert Baratheon: What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
Eddard Stark: You should have asked me 20 years ago.
Robert Baratheon: There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.
Eddard Stark:  I recall a few chances.
Robert Baratheon: There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
Eddard Stark:  Bessie. She was one of yours.
Robert Baratheon: Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?
Eddard Stark:  Wylla.
Robert Baratheon: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
Eddard Stark:  Nor will I.
Robert Baratheon: We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.
Eddard Stark: The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
Robert Baratheon: Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.
Eddard Stark:  Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
Robert Baratheon: A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.
Eddard Stark: She's little more than a child.
Robert Baratheon: Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
Eddard Stark:  Tell me we're not speaking of this.
Robert Baratheon: Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.
Eddard Stark:  But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?
Robert Baratheon:  This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.
Eddard Stark: Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.
Robert Baratheon:  There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.
Eddard Stark: He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.
Robert Baratheon: There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.
Back across the sea, Drogo fornicates with Daenerys, she’s clearly not enjoying it.
On their way to the Wall, stopping to set up camp for the night.
Benjen Stark: Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
Tyrion Lannister: Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
Jon Snow: Why do you read so much?
Tyrion Lannister: Look at me and tell me what you see.
Jon Snow:  Is this a trick?
Tyrion Lannister:  What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.
Jon Snow: Until your brother killed that King.
Tyrion Lannister: Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?
Jon Snow: Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.
Tyrion Lannister:  A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.
Jon Snow: The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
Tyrion Lannister: Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.
Bran’s bedroom, Catelyn still at his bedside, Maester Luwin walks in.
Maester Luwin: It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
Catelyn Stark:  Talk to Poole about it.
Maester Luwin: Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...
Catelyn Stark: I don't care about appointments!
Robb Stark:  I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
Maester Luwin: Very good, my Lord. My Lady.
Robb Stark:  When was the last time you left this room?
Catelyn Stark:  I have to take care of him.
Robb Stark: He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
Catelyn Stark: What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
Robb Stark: Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...
Catelyn Stark: Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop! (Wolf’s howling repeatedly)
Robb Stark:  Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
Assassin: You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
Catelyn Stark:  No!
The man is an assassin, when he draws his blade, Catelyn begins to fend him off. In the process her hands are both sliced. The man walks within inches of Bran and his direwolf comes in and mauls the assassin.
In Daenerys’ tent across the Narrow Sea.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Have you ever seen a dragon?
Irri: Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Everywhere? Even in the east?
Irri: No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
Jhiqui: It is known.
Doreah: A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
Daenerys Targaryen: The moon?
Doreah: He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.
Irri: Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
Jhiqui: It is known.
Daenerys Targaryen: Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
Irri leaves the tent.
Doreah: Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.
Daenerys Targaryen: How old were you?
Doreah: I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Nine?!
Doreah: I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
Doreah: Yes.
Daenerys Targaryen: Will it take three years?
Doreah: No.
Jon, Tyrion, Benjen and company arrive at the wall and look at it from afar.
Benjen Stark: Welcome.
Catelyn is on the ground where Bran’s body was discovered, below the tower he fell from. She looks up and sees the window. She now is looking through that same window where Bran fell. She investigates the room, noticing a cleared patch on some flooring, finding a long blonde hair.
Catelyn holds council in the Godswood with Robb, Theon Greyjoy, Rodrick and Maester Luwin.
Catelyn Stark:  What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
Maester Luwin: The boy was always sure-footed before.
Catelyn Stark: Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
Theon Greyjoy: Saw what, my lady?
Catelyn Stark: I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
Rodrick Cassel: Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.
Robb Stark:  They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
Theon Greyjoy: If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.
Maester Luwin: What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.
Catelyn Stark:  I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
Robb Stark:  I'll ride to King's Landing.
Catelyn Stark:  No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
Robb Stark:  Mother, you can't.
Catelyn Stark: I must.
Rodrick Cassel: I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
Catelyn Stark:  Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
Rodrick Cassel: Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
Robb Stark:  What about Bran?
Catelyn Stark:  I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
Back at Daenerys’ tent, Doreah is on top of her, “teaching” Daenerys how to please Khal Drogo.
Doreah: No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
Daenerys Targaryen: Finish a man?
Doreah: Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.
Doreah: You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.
Daenerys Targaryen:  I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
Doreah: If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
Daenerys Targaryen:  No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
The Lannisters, traveling Starks and all royal guards have stopped for the evening to rest on their way to King’s Landing.
Sansa Stark:  Pardon me, Ser.
Sandor Clegane: Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.
Sansa Stark:  I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?
Sandor Clegane: He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
Joffrey Baratheon: He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.
Sansa Stark: Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
Joffrey Baratheon:  My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
In a field next to a river, off from where everyone else is.
Mycah: I'll get you!
Sansa Stark:  Arya!
Arya Stark: What are you doing here? Go away.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Your sister? And who are you, boy?
Mycah: Mycah, my Lord.
Sansa Stark: He the butcher's boy.
Arya Stark: He's my friend.
Joffrey Baratheon:  A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.
Mycah: She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.
Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.
Mycah: It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.
Joffrey Baratheon: And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?
Arya Stark: Stop it!
Sansa Stark:  Arya, stay out of this.
Joffrey Baratheon:  I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
Sansa Stark:  No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!
Joffrey Baratheon:  I'll gut you, you little cunt!
Sansa Stark: Arya!
Arya then steps in and fights with Joffrey, disarming him and putting him on his back. Her direwolf sees this as a thread and runs in to defend.
Arya Stark:  Nymeria!
Joffrey Baratheon:  Please don't.
Sansa Stark:  Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.
Joffrey Baratheon: Then go! Don't touch me.
A hunt has begun for the direwolf that attacked Joffrey.
Soldier 1: The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
Arya hidden from everyone telling her direwolf to leave.
Arya Stark:  You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
Soldier 2: It's a direwolf.
Soldier 1: I'll check down here.
Soldier 2: I think I heard a noise.
Arya Stark:  Go!
Jory comes to tell Ned that his daughter has been found.
Jory Cassel: My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
Eddard Stark: Where is she?
Jory Cassel: She's been taken directly before the King.
Eddard Stark: Who took her?
Jory Cassel: The Lannisters found her.
Eddard Stark: Right, get back.
Jory Cassel: The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
Eddard Stark: Back! Back to the inn. All back!
Now back at the Inn where everyone is staying.
Arya Stark:  I'm sorry.
Eddard Stark: Are you hurt?
Arya Stark: No.
Eddard Stark: It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
Cersei Baratheon:  How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
Robert Baratheon: Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.
Cersei Baratheon: Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
Arya Stark:  That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
Cersei Baratheon: Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
Arya Stark:  That's not what happened!
Joffrey Baratheon:  Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
Arya Stark:  Liar!
Joffrey Baratheon:  Shut up!
Robert Baratheon: Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?
Eddard Stark: In bed asleep.
Cersei Baratheon: She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.
Robert Baratheon: Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.
Sansa Stark: I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
Arya Stark: Liar! Liar liar liar!
Sansa Stark: Arya!
Eddard Stark: Stop it! That's enough of that.
Arya Stark:  Liar liar liar!
Eddard Stark: Stop! Arya!
Cersei Baratheon:  She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
Robert Baratheon: What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over.
Cersei Baratheon:  Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
Robert Baratheon: You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
Eddard Stark: Gladly, your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon:  And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
Robert Baratheon: I'd forgot the damned wolf.
Soldier: We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.
Robert Baratheon: So be it.
Cersei Baratheon: We have another wolf.
Robert Baratheon:  As you will.
Eddard Stark: You can't mean it.
Robert Baratheon: A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
Sansa Stark: He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!
Arya Stark: Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
Sansa Stark:  Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
Eddard Stark: s this your command... your Grace?
Cersei Baratheon:  Where is the beast?
Soldier: Chained up outside, your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon: Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.
Eddard Stark: No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.
Cersei Baratheon: Is this some trick?
Eddard Stark:  The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
Once outside, before Eddard lays to rest the direwolf.
Eddard Stark: The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
Sandor Clegane: He ran... Not very fast.
Eddard kills the direwolf on the King’s orders.
The King, Eddard and the rest of the posse have arrived at King’s Landing.
King’s Landing Guard: Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested.
Eddard Stark: Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.
Jory Cassel: Yes, my Lord.
King’s Landing Guard: If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
Ned Stark gives the guard a blank stare before taking off his gloves, the guard realizes Ned’s disinterest and the two begin walking to the council chamber. First they walk through the Great Hall, where the throne sits. Jaime Lannister is lingering in front of the throne.
Jaime Lannister: Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.
Eddard Stark: Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
Jaime Lannister: Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.
Eddard Stark:  Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
Jaime Lannister: I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.
Eddard Stark: You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
Jaime Lannister: I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.
Eddard Stark:  But you just stood there and watched.
Jaime Lannister: 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.
Eddard Stark: Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
Jaime Lannister: Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
Eddard Stark:  You served him well, when serving was safe.
Ned enters the small council’s chamber where the others are already awaiting him.
Varys: Lord Stark.
Eddard Stark: Lord Varys.
Varys: I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
Eddard Stark:  A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
Renly Baratheon: And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...
Petyr Baelish: But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
Eddard Stark:  She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
Petyr Baelish: All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
Eddard Stark: Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
Petyr Baelish: It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.
Grand Maester Pycelle: I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.
Eddard Stark:  Grand Maester.
Grand Maester Pycelle: How many years has it been? You were a young man.
Eddard Stark: And you served another King.
Grand Maester Pycelle: How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?
Eddard Stark:  Without the King?
Renly Baratheon: Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.
Varys: His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
Petyr Baelish:  We are the lords of small matters here.
Renly Baratheon: My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
Petyr Baelish:  Mmm, how much?
Eddard Stark: 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Can the treasury bear such expense?
Petyr Baelish:  I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?
Eddard Stark:  Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
Petyr Baelish: I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
Eddard Stark:  How could you let this happen?
Petyr Baelish:  The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
Eddard Stark:  I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.
Renly Baratheon: "Counting coppers," he calls it.
Eddard Stark:  I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
Petyr Baelish:  As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.
Eddard Stark:  There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.
Varys: You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.
Cersei tending to Joffrey’s “wound”.
Cersei Baratheon: Please, it's nearly healed.
Joffrey Baratheon:  It's ugly.
Cersei Baratheon: A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.
Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.
Cersei Baratheon: That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.
Joffrey Baratheon: Do I have to marry her?
Cersei Baratheon: Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.
Joffrey Baratheon:  I don't want to.
Cersei Baratheon: No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.
Joffrey Baratheon: We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
Cersei Baratheon: How would you handle them?
Joffrey Baratheon:  I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.
Cersei Baratheon:  A royal army?
Joffrey Baratheon:  Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.
Cersei Baratheon: And if the northerners rebel?
Joffrey Baratheon: I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.
Cersei Baratheon: And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
Joffrey Baratheon:  For me. I'm their King.
Cersei Baratheon:  But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.
Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm not asking.
Cersei Baratheon: The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.
Joffrey Baratheon:  So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
Cersei Baratheon:  Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
Arya, Sansa and their Septa are all around a table eating. Arya is stabbing a knife into the table between her fingers.
Septa Mordane: Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.
Arya Stark:  I'm practicing.
Sansa Stark:  Practicing for what?
Arya Stark: The Prince.
Septa Mordane: Arya, stop!
Arya Stark: He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
Sansa Stark: The Hound killed your friend.
Arya Stark: The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
Sansa Stark: You're an idiot.
Arya Stark: You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.
Septa Mordane: Enough!
Septa Mordane begins escorting Arya away from the table as Ned walks in.
Eddard Stark:  What's happening here?
Septa Mordane: Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
Eddard Stark:  Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…
Ned places a wrapped package in front of Sansa on the table.
Eddard Stark:  The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
Sansa Stark: I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
Septa Mordane: You've barely eaten a thing.
Eddard Stark:  It's all right. Go on.
Sansa gets up from the table, leaving only Ned and Septa Mordane.
Eddard Stark: War was easier than daughters.
Arya is unsheathing Needle privately in her room as Ned knocks on the door.
Arya Stark: Go away!
Eddard Stark: Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?
Arya Stark:  Mine.
Eddard Stark:  Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
Arya Stark: I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
Eddard Stark:  Come here. Now what do you want with this?
Arya Stark:  It's called Needle.
Eddard Stark:  A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
Arya Stark: Stick 'em with the pointy end.
Eddard Stark: [laughs] That's the essence of it.
Arya Stark: I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
Eddard Stark:  No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.
Arya Stark: I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.
Eddard Stark:  Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
Arya Stark: So was I! He is a liar.
Eddard Stark: Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.
Arya Stark: But how you can let her marry someone like that?
Eddard Stark: Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
Arya Stark: Winter is coming.
Eddard Stark: You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.
Arya Stark: I don't hate her. Not really.
Eddard Stark: I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.
Arya Stark: I can keep it?
Eddard Stark:  Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.
Bran’s bedside in Winterfell. A crow lands on his windowsill.
Old Nan:  Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
Bran Stark:  I hate your stories.
Old Nan:  I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
Bran Stark: Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
Old Nan: Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…
Robb walks into the room, interrupting Old Nan’s story.
Robb Stark:  What are you telling him now?
Old Nan: Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
Robb Stark:  Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
Bran Stark:  Maybe we do.
Robb Stark:  How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.
Bran Stark:  I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.
Robb Stark: Don't ever say that.
Bran Stark: I'd rather be dead.
Catelyn and Rodrick arrive at King’s Landing, entering through a back entrance.
Rodrick Cassel: Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.
Catelyn Stark:  It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
Rodrick Cassel: My Lady.
Two guards pull up to her on horseback and hand her a scroll, informing her that she is to follow them.
Guard: Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?
Catelyn Stark:  I would. We've done nothing wrong.
Guard: We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
Catelyn Stark: Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...
Guard: Follow me, Lady Stark.
At Baelish’s brothel.
Petyr Baelish:  Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. (to his whores)
Catelyn Stark:  You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
Two naked whores interrupt, Baelish snaps at them to leave.
Petyr Baelish: I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
Catelyn Stark:  How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
Petyr Baelish:  No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
Catelyn Stark:  How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
Petyr Baelish: A dear friend told me.
Varys:  Lady Stark.
Catelyn Stark:  Lord Varys.
Varys:  To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
Catelyn Stark: How did you know I was coming?
Varys:  Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.
Catelyn Stark:  Do you know whose dagger this is?
Varys:  I must admit I do not.
Petyr Baelish:  Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.
Catelyn Stark:  Yours?
Petyr Baelish: At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.
Catelyn Stark: To whom?
Petyr Baelish:  Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
At Castle Black, in a courtyard. Grenn and Jon are swordfighting, Jon getting the best of him and breaking his nose.
Alliser Thorne: If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?
Pyp steps forward and with one move Jon has him on his back.
Alliser Thorne: Next!
Jon quickly dispatches of another newcomer, we see Lord Commander Jeor and Tyrion looking on from a balcony.
Alliser Thorne: Next!
Another man starts againt Jon Snow, as another joins, Jon defeats the two of them almost instantly.
Alliser Thorne: Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.
Tyrion and Lord Commander talking, overlooking the courtyard.
Tyrion Lannister: A charming man.
Jeor Mormont: I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
Tyrion Lannister: And how's that going, Commander Mormont?
Jeor Mormont: Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
Tyrion Lannister: Good news or bad?
Jeor Mormont: Both.
Back in the throne room, just outside of the small council chambers.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
Petyr Baelish:  Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
Eddard Stark:  My wife is in Winterfell.
Petyr Baelish:  Is she?
Baelish leads Ned to the entrance of his brothel. Ned is not so keen on the idea and begins choking Baelish.
Petyr Baelish:  I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
Eddard Stark: You're a funny man. A very funny man.
Catelyn Stark:  Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
Petyr Baelish: The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.
Jon is in the armory of Castle Black, putting away equipment when a gang of the guys jump him.
Grenn: You broke my nose, bastard!
Jon Snow:  It's an improvement.
Grenn: If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.
Pyp: I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
Grenn: What're you looking at, halfman?
Tyrion Lannister:  I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
Rast: What do you care about our faces?
Tyrion Lannister: It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.
Grenn: We'll talk later, Lord Snow.
Jon Snow: Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
Tyrion Lannister:  Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.
Jon Snow: They hate me because I'm better than they are.
Tyrion Lannister: It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
At Baelish’s brothel.
Petyr Baelish: The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
Catelyn Stark: We have proof. We have the blade.
Petyr Baelish:  Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.
Catelyn Stark:  Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
Petyr Baelish:  I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.
Catelyn Stark: I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
Petyr Baelish:  Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
In the Queen’s chambers.
Cersei Baratheon: How could you be so stupid?
Jaime Lannister: Calm down.
Cersei Baratheon: He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
Jaime Lannister: I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
Cersei Baratheon: Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
Jaime Lannister: Then what are you raving about?
Cersei Baratheon: What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
Jaime Lannister: We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
Cersei Baratheon: And my husband?
Jaime Lannister: I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us : "The War for Cersei's Cunt."
Cersei hits Jaime, he spins her around and hugs her from behind, whispering into her ear.
Cersei Baratheon: Let me go.
Jaime Lannister: Never.
Cersei Baratheon: Let me go.
Jaime Lannister: The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.
In a back alley before Catelyn leaves King’s Landing.
Catelyn Stark:  I wish I could see the girls.
Eddard Stark:  It's too dangerous.
Catelyn Stark: Just for a moment.
Eddard Stark:  Until we know who our enemies are...
Catelyn Stark: I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.
Eddard Stark:  Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
Cersei Baratheon: And if you find the proof?
Eddard Stark: Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.
Catelyn Stark: My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.
Eddard Stark: He still loves you.
Catelyn Stark: Does he?
Eddard Stark: Off with you.
In the King’s chambers, he’s drinking and eating at a table.
Robert Baratheon:  It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
Barristan Selmy: Of course, your Grace.
Robert Baratheon:  Who was it?
Barristan Selmy: A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
Robert Baratheon: How'd you do it?
Barristan Selmy: Lance through the heart.
Robert Baratheon: Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, "Wait! Wait!"... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?
Lancel Lannister: It's empty, your Grace.
Robert Baratheon: What do you mean it's empty?
Lancel Lannister: There's no more wine.
Robert Baratheon:  Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
Jaime Lannister: One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
Barristan Selmy: I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.
Jaime Lannister: You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
Barristan Selmy: A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.
Robert Baratheon: Your outlaw... Any last words?
Jaime Lannister: I cut his head off, so no.
Robert Baratheon: What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
Jaime Lannister: He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... "Burn them all." If that's all, your Grace...
Riding horseback and walking through fields.
Daenerys Targaryen: : Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?
Jorah Mormont:  The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
Daenerys Targaryen: From whom?
Jorah Mormont:  If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices : pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.
Daenerys sees one of the Dothraki men strike a slave with a whip for not moving fast enough.
Daenerys Targaryen: Tell them all to stop.
Jorah Mormont: You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
Daenerys Targaryen:  Until I command them otherwise.
Jorah Mormont:  You're learning to talk like a Queen.
Daenerys Targaryen: Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
Daenerys dismounts her horse and walks through the field off of the path. She hears noises coming towards her and grass snapping. Her brother Viserys storms into the clearing on horseback wielding a sword.
Viserys Targaryen: You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
Viserys has his sword to Daenerys’ throat. Rakharo whips Viserys, wrapping it around his neck and yanking him to his back.
Irri: Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  No!
Irri: Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.
Viserys Targaryen: Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
Jorah Mormont:  Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?
Rakharo: You walk. [to Viserys]
Jon and Benjen looking out over the wall. Benjen saying goodbye.
Benjen Stark:  I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
Jon Snow: You're leaving?
Benjen Stark: I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
Jon Snow:  What kind of reports?
Benjen Stark:  The kind I don't want to believe.
Jon Snow: 'm ready. I won't let you down.
Benjen Stark: You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.
Jon Snow: But I'm better than every...
Benjen Stark: Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.
Yoren and Tyrion getting drunk on wine in a the mess hall of Castle Black.
Yoren: A bear's balls.
Tyrion Lannister: You're joking?
Yoren: And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.
Tyrion Lannister: And how do a bear's balls taste?
Yoren: A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?
Tyrion Lannister:  Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?
Yoren: But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
Tyrion Lannister: They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
Benjen enters.
Benjen Stark: The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?
Tyrion Lannister:  You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.
Benjen Stark:  I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.
Tyrion Lannister: Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
Benjen Stark: Call me what you like.
Tyrion Lannister:  I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
Benjen Stark: You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts.
Tyrion Lannister: But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.
Benjen Stark:  You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.
Yoren: Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.
Benjen Stark:  Enjoy the capital, brother.
Yoren: I always do.
Tyrion Lannister: I think he's starting to like me. "Going below"?
Yoren: Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
Tyrion Lannister: So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
Yoren: Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
Tyrion Lannister: Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
Yoren: I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.
Tyrion Lannister:  Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
Irri is braiding Daenerys hair and teaching her Dothraki. She feels Daenerys’ breast.
Irri: Yes, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  What are you doing?
Irri: When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion.
Jorah and Rakharo around a fire in a tent.
Jorah Mormont:  For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.
Rakharo: Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses.
Jorah Mormont: Armor.
Rakharo: Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
Jorah Mormont:  Slow.
Rakharo: Slow.
Jorah Mormont: It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.
Rakharo: My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
Jorah Mormont:  I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.
Rakharo: He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?
Jorah Mormont: He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
Irri: The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
Rakharo: There are no rabbits.
Irri: Find some ducks, she likes ducks.
Rakharo: Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?
Irri: Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
Jorah Mormont: I don't think she wants to eat dog.
Irri: The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
Rakharo: A blessing from the Great Stallion.
Irri: She does not want to eat horse.
Jorah Mormont: I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
Rhakaro: We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
Jorah Mormont: Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
Back again in the courtyard of Castle Black. Jon is battling his brothers in black as Tyrion overlooks from the balcony. Jon continuing to defeat them, he begins teaching them.
Jon Snow: Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
Tyrion reenters the hall to speak and drink with Aemon and Lord Commander.
Maester Aemon: How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
Tyrion Lannister:  Eight... no, nine.
Maester Aemon: All of them brief?
Tyrion Lannister:  They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.
Maester Aemon: This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually : winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.
Jeor Mormont: We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.
Tyrion Lannister:  Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.
Jeor Mormont: One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
Maester Aemon: The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
Jeor Mormont: Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
Maester Aemon: When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.
The Khal and Daenerys are intertwined in their tent via candlelight. Daenerys surprises Drogo and speaks Dothraki to him.
Daenerys Targaryen:  It’s a boy.
Khal Drogo: How do you know?
Daenerys Targaryen: I know.
Tyrion is pissing off of the wall, when he’s done, Jon and him converse near a fire.
Jon Snow:  I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.
Tyrion Lannister: It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
Jon Snow:  Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
Tyrion Lannister:  I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
Jon Snow:  If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.
Tyrion Lannister: Of course.
Jon Snow: He'll never walk again.
Tyrion Lannister: If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.
Jon Snow: Farewell, My Lord.
Arya arrives to her “dance lesson” in King’s Landing.
Syrio Forel:  You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.
Arya Stark:  Who are you?
Syrio Forel: Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.
Syrio throws a wooden sword to Arya, she does not catch it, but drops it.
Syrio Forel: Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.
Arya Stark:  It's too heavy.
Syrio Forel:  It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
Arya Stark: What if I drop it?
Syrio Forel: The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.
Arya Stark: I'm a girl.
Syrio Forel:  Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...
Arya Stark:  A needle.
Syrio Forel: Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me.
Arya takes several attempts as Syrio turns his back, defending her and disarming her constantly. She begins picking up on a few things, but still needs much work. Ned enters in the doorway and his smile turns to a grimace watching his daughter swordfight.
Syrio Forel: Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.
Open to Bran Stark dreaming. He is in the courtyard of Winterfell shooting a bow as a raven flies in. As he approaches it, it flies into the crypt, continuously cawing. As Bran enters the crypt he makes direct eye contact with the raven and sees that it has three eyes. He wakes up. Theon enters just as he wakes up.
Old Nan: The little Lord's been dreaming again.
Theon Greyjoy: We have visitors.
Bran Stark: I don't want to see anyone.
Theon Greyjoy: Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.
Bran Stark: I don't want to go.
Theon Greyjoy: Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! (Hodor enters, hoisting up Bran and carrying him away) Help Bran down the hall.
Tyrion standing in front of Robb and Maester Luwin inside the Winterfell castle.
Tyrion Lannister:  I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
Robb Stark: Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
Tyrion Lannister: Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?
Robb Stark: I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.
Tyrion Lannister: Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
Hodor enters carrying Bran.
Tyrion Lannister: So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
Maester Luwin: He has no memory of that day.
Tyrion Lannister: Curious.
Robb Stark:  Why are you here?
Tyrion Lannister: Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
Bran Stark: Kneel, Hodor.
Tyrion Lannister: Do you like to ride, Bran?
Bran Stark: Yes. Well, I mean I did like to.
Maester Luwin: The boy has lost the use of his legs.
Tyrion Lannister: What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.
Bran Stark: I'm not a cripple.
Tyrion Lannister: Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
Bran Stark: Will I really be able to ride?
Tyrion Lannister:You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
Robb Stark: Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
Tyrion Lannister: I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.
Robb Stark: You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
Tyrion Lannister: Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.
Before Tyrion exits Winterfell for the brothel, Theon sees him off in the courtyard.
Theon Greyjoy: Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.
Tyrion Lannister: Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.
Theon Greyjoy: He's not my master.
Tyrion Lannister: No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?
Theon Greyjoy: She wasn't feeling well.
Tyrion Lannister: She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?
Theon Greyjoy: My lady's whereabouts...
Tyrion Lannister: My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?
Theon Greyjoy: Must have been a pretty sight.
Tyrion Lannister: Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.
Theon Greyjoy: We were outnumbered 10 to one.
Tyrion Lannister: A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.
Theon Greyjoy: Careful, Imp.
Tyrion Lannister: I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.
In the courtyard of Castle Black, Jon Snow is giving the group lessons in fighting. As Alliser marches in with a new recruit, Samwell Tarly.
Jon Snow: Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.
Grenn: What in seven hells is that?
Pyp: They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
Alliser Thorne: Tell them your name.
Samwell Tarly: Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black.
Rast: Come to take the black pudding.
Alliser Thorne: Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do.
Samwell Tarly: I yield. Please, no more.
Alliser Thorne: On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder.
Jon Snow: Enough! He yielded.
Alliser Thorne: Looks like the bastard's in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard.
Jon Snow: Are you sure you want to do this?
Alliser has the three guys attack Jon, trying to get to Sam, Jon successfully defends them all off.
Grenn: No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
Alliser Thorne: We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
Pyp: Well fought!
Grenn: Piss off.
Samwell Tarly: Did he hurt you?
Jon Snow:  I've had worse.
Samwell Tarly: You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
Jon Snow: It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.
Grenn: Why didn't you get up and fight?
Samwell Tarly: I wanted to. I just couldn't.
Grenn: Why not?
Samwell Tarly: I'm a coward. My father always says so.
Jon Snow:  The Wall's no place for cowards.
Samwell Tarly: You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
Grenn: A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
Pyp: You're too stupid to be a coward.
Grenn: You're too stupid to be a...
Pyp: Quick now, before summer's over.
Grenn: Come on here!
Daenerys and the horde have arrived to the Dothraki homeland.
Jorah Mormont: Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
Daenerys Targaryen: These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
Viserys Targaryen: I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.
Daenerys Targaryen: If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
Jorah Mormont: The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
Daenerys Targaryen: But if they did?
Jorah Mormont: King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.
Daenerys Targaryen: And you know these men?
Jorah Mormont: I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land.
Daenerys Targaryen: You sold slaves.
Jorah Mormont: Aye.
Daenerys Targaryen: Why?
Jorah Mormont: I had no money and an expensive wife.
Daenerys Targaryen: And where is she now?
Jorah Mormont: In another place, with another man.
Viserys is in a tub inside of a tent, being bathed by Doreah.
Doreah: Your Grace?
Viserys Targaryen: Yes, my dear?
Doreah: They call you the last dragon...
Viserys Targaryen: They do.
Doreah: You have dragon's blood in your veins?
Viserys Targaryen: It's entirely possible.
Doreah: What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
Viserys Targaryen: The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles.
Doreah: I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
Viserys Targaryen:Really? Why dragons?
Doreah: They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.
Viserys Targaryen: Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.
Doreah: I was not locked in. I have seen things.
Viserys Targaryen: What have you seen?
Doreah: I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
Viserys Targaryen: A pirate ship?
Doreah: A dragon.
Viserys Targaryen: No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen : their skulls. They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep. When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him. When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet. The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong. Skulls no bigger than dog skulls. But as you got closer to the Iron Throne... They got bigger and bigger and bigger. There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar... And Balerion the Dread... whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one.
Doreah: What happened to the skulls?
Viserys Targaryen: I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind.
Doreah: That's very sad.
Viserys Targaryen: Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?
Doreah: No, your Grace. To teach your sister.
Viserys Targaryen: To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
Inside of the throne room at King’s Landing.
Septa Mordane: Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince...
Sansa Stark: What if I have a girl?
Septa Mordane: Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.
Sansa Stark: What if I only have girls?
Septa Mordane: I wouldn't worry about that.
Sansa Stark: Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls.
Septa Mordane: Yes, but it's highly unlikely.
Sansa Stark: But what if?
Septa Mordane: If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.
Sansa Stark: And everyone would hate me.
Septa Mordane: Nobody could ever hate you.
Sansa Stark: Joffrey does.
Septa Mordane: Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
Sansa Stark: Please shut up about it.
Septa Mordane: Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
Sansa Stark: Aegon the Conqueror.
Septa Mordane: And who built the Red Keep?
Sansa Stark: Maegor the Cruel.
Septa Mordane: And how many years did it take to build...
Sansa Stark: My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?
Septa Mordane: They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.
Sansa Stark: The Mad King.
Septa Mordane: Commonly known as the Mad King.
Sansa Stark: Why were they killed?
Septa Mordane: You should speak to your father about these matters.
Sansa Stark: I don't want to speak to my father, ever.
Septa Mordane: You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
Sansa Stark: No, I won't.
Small council meeting in King’s Landing.
Janos Slynt: It's the Hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords.
Eddard Stark: The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
Janos Slynt: Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.
Varys: Dreadful.
Renly Baratheon: If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.
Janos Slynt: I need more men.
Eddard Stark:  You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
Petyr Baelish: I will?
Eddard Stark:  You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left.
Janos Slynt: Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use.
Eddard Stark: The sooner this is over, the better.
Varys: The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.
Petyr Baelish: And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
Eddard Stark: I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?
Eddard dismisses the council, as they are all leaving, Ned stops Pycelle.
Grand Maester Pycelle: This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord.
Eddard Stark:  I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
Eddard Stark:  Why?
Grand Maester Pycelle: I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
Eddard Stark:  What did Jon want the night before he died?
Grand Maester Pycelle: He came inquiring after a book.
Eddard Stark:  A book? What book?
Grand Maester Pycelle: I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome.
Eddard Stark: I'd like to read it.
Now in Pycelle’s room, he hands a book to Ned.
Grand Maester Pycelle: "The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."
Eddard Stark:  "Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained
in a bear hunt."
Grand Maester Pycelle: As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read.
Eddard Stark:  Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
Grand Maester Pycelle: He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask.
Eddard Stark:  Jon's death...
Grand Maester Pycelle: Such a tragedy.
Eddard Stark:  Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
Grand Maester Pycelle:Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating: "The seed is strong," I think it was.
Eddard Stark:  "The seed is strong"? What does that mean?
Grand Maester Pycelle: The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.
Eddard Stark: And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
Grand Maester Pycelle: What else could it be?
Eddard Stark:  Poison.
Grand Maester Pycelle: A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
Eddard Stark:  I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?
Eddard Stark:  Everybody knows that.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know.
Eddard Stark: I've taken enough of your time.
Grand Maester Pycelle: No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor...
Eddard Stark:  Thank you. I'll find my own way out.
Ned is walking back to his chambers as he sees Arya balancing on one foot in front of a staircase.
Arya Stark: Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
Eddard Stark:  It's a hard fall down these steps.
Arya Stark: Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
Eddard Stark:  Cats? Syrio says…
Arya Stark: He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
Eddard Stark:  He's right about that.
Arya Stark: Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
Eddard Stark: He needs to get his strength back first.
Arya Stark:He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?
Eddard Stark: No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
Arya Stark: Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
Eddard Stark: You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
Arya Stark: No. That's not me.
Keeping watch on the wall, Sam joins Jon as his watch partner.
Samwell Tarly: Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well.
Jon Snow: Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
Samwell Tarly: No, that's all right. I'm fine.
Jon Snow: You're not. You're freezing.
Samwell Tarly: I don't like high places.
Jon Snow:  You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?
Samwell Tarly: On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. "You're almost a man now," he said, "but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not," he said, "then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more." Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?
Jon Snow:  Yes, he is.
Samwell Tarly: I'm not going to get any better, you know?
Jon Snow:  Well… You can't get any worse.
Walking through the gardens of King’s Landing.
Petyr Baelish: I hear you're reading a boring book.
Eddard Stark: Pycelle talks too much.
Petyr Baelish: He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.
Eddard Stark:  Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
Petyr Baelish: I promised Cat that I'd help you.
Eddard Stark:  Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.
Petyr Baelish: A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
Eddard Stark: Varys or the Queen?
Petyr Baelish: No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
Eddard Stark:  Yes.
Petyr Baelish: The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel.
Eddard Stark:  Why?
Petyr Baelish: I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.
Eddard Stark: Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.
Petyr Baelish: Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
Preparing for the Hand of the King’s tournament, Ser Hugh is pacing out steps on the joust.
Jory Cassel: Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
Hugh of the Vale: As you can see, I'm busy.
Jory Cassel: I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard.
Hugh of the Vale: I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...
Jory Cassel: No "ser." I'm not a knight.
Hugh of the Vale: I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.
Riding on horseback through King’s Landing, Ned and Jory arrive at the armorer.
Jory Cassel: He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see.
Eddard Stark:  A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
Jory Cassel: You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where.
Eddard Stark: Let them look.
Tobho Mott: The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.
Eddard Stark:  What did Lord Arryn want?
Tobho Mott: He always came to see the boy.
Eddard Stark:  I'd like to see him as well.
Tobho Mott: As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.
Eddard Stark: This is fine work.
Gendry: It's not for sale.
Tobho Mott: Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet...
Gendry: I made it for me.
Tobho Mott: Forgive him, my Lord.
Eddard Stark: There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?
Gendry: He just asked me questions is all, my Lord.
Eddard Stark: What kind of questions?
Gendry: About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother.
Eddard Stark: Your mother?
Gendry: Who she was, what she looked like.
Eddard Stark: What did you tell him?
Gendry: She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
Eddard Stark: Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.
Jory Cassel: Find anything?
Eddard Stark: King Robert's bastard son.
Jaime is standing guard outside of the king’s chambers. You can hear King Robert with numerous girls inside his room.
Jory Cassel: This is for the King from Lord Stark.
Jaime Lannister: Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
Jory Cassel: Three? Four?
Jaime Lannister:  He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
Jory Cassel: Forgive me, my Lord...
Jaime Lannister: Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
Jory Cassel: We've met before, you know.
Jaime Lannister:  Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.
Jory Cassel: The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
Jaime Lannister: That's where you got your scar?
Jory Cassel: Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
Jaime Lannister:  Vicious sons of whores.
Jory Cassel: They like their bloodshed.
Jaime Lannister: They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
Jory Cassel: With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
Jaime Lannister:  I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
Jory Cassel: Theon? He's a good lad.
Jaime Lannister:  I doubt it.
Robert Baratheon: I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
Jory Cassel: Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
Jaime Lannister: I don't serve Lord Stark.
In the mess hall at Castle Black.
Grenn: Where have you been?
Jon Snow: Watch duty. With Sam.
Pyp: Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
Jon Snow: He wasn't hungry.
Pyp: Impossible!
Jon Snow: That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.
Rast: You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.
All of the new recruits are sleeping. Jon, Ghost (his direwolf), Pyp and Grenn ambush and gag Rast as he sleeps. Jon threatens him.
Jon Snow:  No one touches Sam.
Back in the training yard the next morning. Rast is defying Alliser and not attacking Sam.
Alliser Thorne: What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there.
Grenn: Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield.
Alliser Thorne: You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?
After their bath, Viserys drags Doreah by her hair through the camp and into Daenerys’ tent.
Viserys Targaryen: You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
Doreah: Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.
Daenerys Targaryen: Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us.
Irri: Yes, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen: Why did you hit her?!
Viserys Targaryen: How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
Daenerys Targaryen: I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
Viserys Targaryen: What's this?
Daenerys Targaryen: It's a gift. I had it made for you.
Viserys Targaryen: Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
Daenerys Targaryen: Please.
Viserys Targaryen: This stinks of manure. All of it.
Viserys Targaryen: You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.
Daenerys Targaryen: You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
Viserys Targaryen: You do not talk back to me!
Viserys hit Daenerys, as he mounts her to keep hitting her, she fends him off with a chain.
Viserys Targaryen: You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
Daenerys Targaryen: I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
Inside the Castle Black mess hall, cleaning up.
Samwell Tarly: I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
Jon Snow: I wouldn't doubt it.
Samwell Tarly: Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
Jon Snow:  Sally on the side?
Samwell Tarly:It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.
Jon Snow: I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
Samwell Tarly:Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
Jon Snow:  As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.
Samwell Tarly: I find that hard to believe.
Jon Snow:  I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...
Samwell Tarly:You didn't know where to put it?
Jon Snow:  I know where to put it.
Samwell Tarly:Was she... Old and ugly?
Jon Snow:  Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
Samwell Tarly: What color hair?
Jon Snow: Red.
Samwell Tarly: I like red hair. And her... Her...
Jon Snow:  You don't want to know.
Samwell Tarly: That good?
Jon Snow: Better.
Samwell Tarly: Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
Jon Snow:  What's my name?
Samwell Tarly: Jon Snow?
Jon Snow:  And why is my surname Snow?
Samwell Tarly: Because... You're a bastard from the north.
Jon Snow: I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.
Samwell Tarly: So... You didn't know where to put it?
Alliser Thorne: Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys.
Samwell Tarly: It is a bit nippy.
Alliser Thorne: A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?
Jon Snow: I build my own fires.
Alliser Thorne: That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies.
Inside Daenerys’ tent, speaking privately to Jorah.
Daenerys Targaryen: I hit him. I hit the dragon.
Jorah Mormont: Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
Daenerys Targaryen: He is still the true King.
Jorah Mormont: The truth now: do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?
Daenerys Targaryen: No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
Jorah Mormont: The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.
Daenerys Targaryen:What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?
Jorah Mormont: Home.
Daenerys Targaryen: I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
At the Hand of the King’s tournament. Baelish sees Sansa looking at Joffrey who hides his face from her.
Petyr Baelish: Lover's quarrel?
Sansa Stark: I'm sorry. Do I...?
Septa Mordane: Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known...
Petyr Baelish: An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
Arya Stark: Why do they call you Littlefinger?
Sansa Stark: Arya!
Septa Mordane: Don't be rude!
Petyr Baelish: No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.
Robert Baratheon: I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
The competitors step forward on their horses, Baelish introduces them to Sansa.
Sansa Stark: Gods, who is that?
Petyr Baelish: Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother.
Sansa Stark: And his opponent?
Petyr Baelish: Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
Robert Baratheon: Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!
The joust begins. The first pass takes its course with no contact. On the second pass, the Mountain’s joust strikes Ser Hugh in the neck, causing a massive splinter, and his blood gushing out. This occurs directly in front of where Sansa is sitting.
Petyr Baelish: Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.
Sansa Stark: I won't tell anyone. I promise.
Petyr Baelish: No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.
In Eddard’s quarters, Cersei enters.
Jory Cassel: My Lord, Her Grace the Queen.
Eddard Stark: Your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon: You're missing your tournament.
Eddard Stark: Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
Cersei Baratheon: I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
Eddard Stark:  She likes it here.
Cersei Baratheon: The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her.
Eddard Stark: What are you doing here?
Cersei Baratheon:  I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
Eddard Stark:  The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.
Cersei Baratheon: You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.
Eddard Stark:  If that's my job, then so be it.
Cersei Baratheon: You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.
Eddard Stark:  I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon: As was I.
At an inn along the King’s Road. Catelyn is heading back towards Winterfell.
Marillion: Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!
Catelyn Stark: And to you.
Rodrick Cassel: Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly.
Marillion: Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?
Rodrick Cassel: I'd rather throw myself down a well.
Marillion: Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!
Tyrion and Yoren of the Night’s Watch enter the inn. Catelyn attempts to hide herself.
Masha Heddle: I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room.
Tyrion Lannister: My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.
Masha Heddle: Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
Tyrion Lannister: Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
Bronn: You can have my room.
Tyrion Lannister: There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.
Yoren: Aye, my Lord.
Marillion: My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
Tyrion Lannister: Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
Masha Heddle: Lady Stark.
Catelyn Stark: I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?
Knight of House Whent: It is, my Lady.
Catelyn Stark: And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
Knight of House Whent: She is.
Catelyn Stark: The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
Knight of House Bracken: Our lord is honored by his trust.
Tyrion Lannister: I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.
Catelyn Stark:Knight of House Frey: Lord Walder is well, my Lady. He has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday. He plans to take another wife.
Catelyn Stark: This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice.
All of the knights draw their swords towards Tyrion.
King's Landing, Ned Stark arrives at the grounds where the Tourney of the Hand will take place. He enters a tent where Ser Hugh (deceased) is being tended to, he enters to speak with Barristan.
Eddard Stark: Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
Barristan Selmy: No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
Eddard Stark: He'd never worn this armor before.
Barristan Selmy: Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
Eddard Stark: Who determines the draw?
Barristan Selmy: All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.
Eddard Stark: Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.
Ned and Barristan both exit the tent and begin walking.
Barristan Selmy: Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
Eddard Stark: I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.
Barristan Selmy: You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
Eddard Stark: My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
Barristan Selmy: He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.
Eddard Stark: And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
Barristan Selmy: Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
Eddard Stark: Yes. That will never happen.
Barristan Selmy: Robert tends to do what he wants.
Eddard Stark: If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.
Ned separates from Barristan and enters King Robert’s tent. Lancel, Robert’s squire, is attempting to dress him in his armor.
Lancel Lannister: It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.
Robert Baratheon: Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
Eddard Stark: You're too fat for your armor.
Robert Baratheon: Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?
Both Robert and Ned begin laughing. Lancel also starts to laugh.
Robert Baratheon: Oh, it’s funny, is it?
Lancel Lannister: No, Your Grace.
Robert Baratheon: No? You don't like the Hand's joke?
Eddard Stark: You're torturing the poor boy.
Robert Baratheon: You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!
Lancel runs out of the tent.
Eddard Stark: The breastplate stretcher?
Robert Baratheon: How long before he figures it out?
Eddard Stark: Maybe you should have one invented.
Robert Baratheon: All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.
Eddard Stark: You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
Robert Baratheon: Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
Eddard Stark: And who's going to hit you back?
Robert Baratheon: Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
Eddard Stark:There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
Robert Baratheon: Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
Eddard Stark: Aye.
Robert Baratheon: … Drink.
Eddard Stark: I'm not thirsty.
Robert Baratheon: Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
Eddard Stark: Your squire... A Lannister boy?
Robert Baratheon: Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. "Cersei Lannister will make a good match", he told me. "You'll need her father on your side." I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood.
Eddard Stark: Robert?
Robert Baratheon: What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!
Now at the jousting track where there are lots of onlookers, cheering. Ser Gregor bows before the King before he and his horse take off down one lane of the track.
Eddard Stark: Where's Arya
Sansa Stark: At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
Sansa Stark: Thank you, Ser Loras.
After bowing to Sansa, Loras exchanges looks with Renly Baratheon. Loras then rides and bows before the King, also taking off down the opposite track.
Sansa Stark: Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
Eddard Stark: Hey.
Sansa Stark: I can't watch.
Behind Ned and Sansa.
Petyr Baelish: 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
Renly Baratheon: I'll take that bet.
Petyr Baelish: Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
Renly Baratheon: Or you could even buy a friend.
Sansa Stark: He's going to die.
Eddard Stark: Ser Loras rides well.
A trumpet is heard and both competitors race down their lanes. Loras knocks Ser Gregor off of his mount.
Renly Baratheon: Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.
Petyr Baelish: And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?
Petyr Baelish: Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.
Sansa Stark: Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
Petyr Baelish: No honor but quite a bit of gold.
Gregor gets up off of the ground, shouts for his sword. His squire brings it to him and then Gregor severs his horse’s head completely off. The crowd is stunned, Gregor then attacks Loras. Knocking him off of his horse and striking him with his sword. Sandor, the Hound, runs down from the stands and fends off his brother.
Robert Baratheon: Stop this madness in the name of your King!
Sandor takes a bow and Gregor storms off. Loras walks up to Sandor, raising his hand in victory.
Loras Tyrell: I owe you my life, Ser.
Sandor Clegane: I'm no Ser.
Stopping for rest, presumed on the Kingsroad on their way to Winterfell.
Catelyn Stark: Remove his hood.
Marillion: On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold. (singing)
Tyrion Lannister: This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
Catelyn Stark: I did... often and loudly.
Tyrion Lannister: Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?
Catelyn Stark: And why would I do that?
Tyrion Lannister: Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
Catelyn Stark: Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
Tyrion Lannister: Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?
Catelyn Stark: Five years ago.
Tyrion Lannister: She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.
Catelyn Stark: I am not a murderer, Lannister.
Tyrion Lannister: Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
Catelyn Stark: The dagger found
Tyrion Lannister: What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
Rodrik Cassel: Should I gag him?
Tyrion Lannister: Why? Am I starting to make sense?
Rodrik Cassel: My Lady, this way.
A rock slams into one of Catelyn’s men, a hill tribe begins to attack. Rodrik moves Catelyn behind a rock, out of harms way. The men, mainly Bronn begin successfully defending against the tribe. Tyrion sees Catelyn pull out a small dagger, he runs over to her and convinces her to cut him loose.
Tyrion Lannister: Untie me. If I die, what's the point?
Tyrion, now loose, runs over and picks up a shield. He fends off an attack as another of Lady Stark’s men kills him. Another tribesman is nearing Catelyn, Tyrion rushes over with his shield, knocks him to the ground and begins slamming it into his throat, directly in front of, and in defense of Catelyn. The battle comes to an end with many of their men defeated.
Catelyn Stark: Rodrik?
Rodrik Cassel: I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself.
Bronn:  Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
Tyrion Lannister: Well, I'm willing if she is.
Back at Winterfell, Maester Luwin and Bran are at a small table, Luwin trying to teach Bran. Bran is fixed on watching Theon as he is practicing his archery.
Maester Luwin: Bran...
Maester Luwin: Lords?
Bran Stark: The Greyjoys.
Theon Greyjoy: Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.
Maester Luwin: And failed rebellions.
Maester Luwin: Good.
Maester Luwin:: Mhmm.
Maester Luwin: Hmm...
Maester Luwin: No. A common saying, but not their official motto.
Maester Luwin: We're still on their words.
Bran Stark: I don't know them.
Maester Luwin: You do know them. Think.
Bran Stark: "Unbowed, unbent, unbroken".
Maester Luwin:That's House Martell.
Bran Stark: "Righteous in wrath".
Maester Luwin: House Hornwood.
Bran Stark: "Family, duty, honor".
Maester Luwin:Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
Bran Stark: "Family, duty, honor"... Is that the right order?
Maester Luwin:You know it is.
Bran Stark: Family comes first?
Maester Luwin: Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
Bran Stark: How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?
Maester Luwin: Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
Bran Stark: And then she left!
Maester Luwin: When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely.
Bran Stark: Why did she leave?
Maester Luwin: I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon.
Bran Stark: Do you know where she is now? Today?
Maester Luwin:No, I don't.
Bran Stark: Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
Maester Luwin: Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
Bran Stark: I'll never shoot another arrow.
Maester Luwin: And where is that written?
Bran Stark: You need legs to work a bow.
Maester Luwin: Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.
Bran Stark: Really?
Maester Luwin: Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
Now in Theon’s quarters inside Winterfell, he’s making love to Ros.
Theon Greyjoy: Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
They break.
Ros: I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
Theon Greyjoy: Important enough for the likes of you.
Ros: You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.
Theon Greyjoy: Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
Ros: Jealous?
Theon Greyjoy: Why should I be jealous?
Theon Greyjoy: Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
Ros: Might surprise you.
Theon Greyjoy: Hmm?
Ros: He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
Theon Greyjoy: Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
Ros: You are jealous.
Theon Greyjoy: I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.
Ros: And what about the Starks?
Theon Greyjoy: I’ve been Lord Stark’s ward since I was eight years old.
Ros: A “ward”, that’s a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…
Theon grabs Ros’ neck from behind.
Theon Greyjoy: My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
Ros: You’re a very serious boy.
Theon Greyjoy: I’m not a boy.
Ros: Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock.
Theon Greyjoy: I don’t want to pay for it.
Ros: Then get yourself a wife.
Arya, at King’s Landing is running through the halls chasing a cat. She’s seen running down a hallway.
Arya Stark: Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Ned is in his chambers at his desk, Varys is speaking to him, walking around securing all of the windows before sitting down to talk more seriously.
Varys: How is your son, my Lord?
Eddard Stark: He'll never walk again.
Varys: But his mind is sound?
Eddard Stark: So they say.
Varys:A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
Varys: If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.
Eddard Stark: I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
Varys: I didn't trust you.
Eddard Stark: So why do you trust me now?
Varys: The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.
Eddard Stark: What sort of doom does the King face?
Varys: The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.
Eddard Stark: Who gave it to him?
Varys: Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.
Eddard Stark: The squire, Ser Hugh?
Varys: Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.
Eddard Stark: If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?
Varys: Someone who could afford it.
Varys: He started asking questions.
We shift to a dark dungeon of King’s Landing. Arya is still chasing the cat. She stops to admire a large dragon’s skull. She hears two men talking, and hides from them, just in earshot. The two men are Lord Varys and Magister Illyrio Mopatis.
Varys: He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
Illyrio Mopatis: And when he knows the truth, what will he do?
Varys: The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.
Illyrio Mopatis: What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?
Varys: This Hand is not the other.
Illyrio Mopatis: We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
Varys: "Delay," you say. "Move fast, " I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.
Illyrio Mopatis: It never was.
The two men leave, Varys locks a gate behind them. Arya runs to the gate and can’t get out. She takes off in the other direction, deeper into the dungeon, to find an exit.
Varys enters the Throne Room, where Baelish is standing, looking at the throne.
Varys: The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
Petyr Baelish: You do move quietly.
Varys: We all have our qualities.
Petyr Baelish: You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
Varys: I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
Petyr Baelish: Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.
Varys: Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.
Petyr Baelish: I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important.
Varys: Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?
Petyr Baelish: All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
Varys: And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
Petyr Baelish: Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.
Varys: Strictly speaking.
Petyr Baelish: Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.
Varys: Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?
Petyr Baelish: Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
Varys: Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.
Petyr Baelish: Saw me with your own eyes?
Varys: Eyes I own.
Petyr Baelish: Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
Varys: Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
Petyr Baelish: One shudders at the thought.
Varys: Oh.
Petyr Baelish: But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
Varys: Have you?
Petyr Baelish: Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.
Varys: Was that you under the bed?
Petyr Baelish: And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm.
Varys: Oh, please.
Petyr Baelish: To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
Renly enters from a different doorway and cuts both men off.
Renly Baratheon: What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming.
Petyr Baelish: To a small council meeting?
Varys: Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
Arya exits a tunnel outside of King’s Landing, at the beach of Blackwater Bay. She heads to the city’s gate but is stopped by two guards.
Guard 1: Off with you. No begging.
Arya Stark: I'm not a beggar. I live here.
Guard 1: D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
Arya Stark: I want to see my father.
Guard 2: I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.
Guard 1: You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.
Arya Stark: My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?
Quick cut to Arya standing in front of Ned at his desk.
Eddard Stark: You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
Arya Stark: They said they were going to kill you.
Eddard Stark: Who did?
Arya Stark: I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.
Eddard Stark: Oh, Arya.
Arya Stark: I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
Eddard Stark: Where did you hear this?
Arya Stark: In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.
Eddard Stark: What were you doing in the dungeons?
Arya Stark: Chasing a cat.
A knock at the door, Jory pokes his head in.
Jory Cassel: Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent.
Eddard Stark: Your name, friend?
Yoren: Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.
Arya Stark: I'm a girl!
Eddard Stark: Did Benjen send you?
Yoren: No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.
Eddard Stark: Ah, we'll find recruits for you.
Yoren: Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow.
Eddard Stark: Know what?
Yoren: Best said in private, my Lord.
Eddard Stark: Go on. We'll talk more later.
Eddard Stark: Jory, take her safely to her room.
Jory Cassel: Come along, my Lady. You heard your father.
Jory escorts Arya to her room.
Arya Stark: How many guards does my father have?
Jory Cassel: Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
Arya Stark: You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?
Jory Cassel: No fear on that count, little Lady.
Ned and Yoren are now alone in Ned’s chambers.
Eddard Stark: Well?
Yoren: It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp.
As Catelyn, Tyrion and her men are arriving to the Vale, they’re met by a group of guards.
Vardis Egen: You're far from home, Lady Stark.
Catelyn Stark: To whom do I speak?
Vardis Egen: Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
Catelyn Stark: There was no time to send word.
Vardis Egen: May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?
Catelyn Stark: That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
Vardis Egen: He doesn't look like a prisoner.
Catelyn Stark: My sister will decide what he looks like.
Vardis Egen: Yes, my Lady. She will at that.
The guards all turn their horses and escort Catelyn and her men towards the Eyrie.
Tyrion Lannister: The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
Bronn: Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
Tyrion Lannister: I like you.
Ned is walking through a courtyard at King’s Landing, heading for the King Robert’s chambers. He is stopped by a royal steward.
Steward: Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.
Steward: The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you.
Eddard Stark: Is it about my wife?
Steward: No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.
Now at the small council meeting with everyone on the council, as well as King Robert.
Robert Baratheon: The whore is pregnant.
Eddard Stark: You're speaking of murdering a child.
Robert Baratheon: I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.
Eddard Stark: You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
Robert Baratheon: Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!
Eddard Stark: Then we're no better than the Mad King.
Robert Baratheon: Careful, Ned. Careful now.
Eddard Stark: You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
Varys: No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child.
Eddard Stark: Based on whose information?
Varys: Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
Eddard Stark: Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
Petyr Baelish: Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.
Eddard Stark: He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?
Robert Baratheon: And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
Eddard Stark: The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
Robert Baratheon: Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
Varys: I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.
Grand Maester Pycelle: I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?
Renly Baratheon: We should have had them both killed years ago.
Petyr Baelish: When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.
Robert Baratheon: She dies.
Eddard Stark: I will have no part in it.
Robert Baratheon: You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.
Ned removes his badge and places it on the table in front of Robert.
Eddard Stark: And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
Robert Baratheon: Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!
Ned is in his chambers quickly packing his things.
Eddard Stark: I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
Jory Cassel: Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you.
Petyr Baelish: His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word "treason" was mentioned.
Eddard Stark: What can I do for you?
Petyr Baelish: When do you return to Winterfell?
Eddard Stark: Why? What do you care?
Petyr Baelish: If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.
Eddard Stark: I don't have the time.
Petyr Baelish: It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
Baelish exits Ned’s chambers, Ned speaks to Jory briefly and then takes off for Baelish.
Eddard Stark: Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
Jory Cassel: Heward and Wyl.
Eddard Stark: Find them and meet me at the stables.
At the Eyrie, Catelyn, her men, and Tyrion are all standing in front of Lady Arryn. Her son is sitting on her lap, breastfeeding. He is clearly too old to be doing so.
Lysa Arryn: You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, "the seed is strong." He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.
Catelyn Stark: Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-
Lysa Arryn: To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
Robin Arryn: Mommy? Is that the bad man?
Lysa Arryn: It is.
Robin Arryn: He's little.
Lysa Arryn: He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
Tyrion Lannister: Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
Lysa Arryn: You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
Tyrion Lannister: If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.
Robin Arryn: You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!
Lysa Arryn: Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby.
Robin Arryn: Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
Lysa Arryn: Perhaps you will, my little love.
Catelyn Stark: This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
Lysa Arryn: Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord.
Mord throws Tyrion into a “skycell.”
Mord: You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!
Back at King’s Landing, inside Renly Baratheon’s chambers. He is sitting, shirtless, with Loras Tyrell kneeling beside him shaving his chest. Loras is also shirtless.
Loras Tyrell: Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
Renly Baratheon: Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man.
Loras Tyrell: You're jealous.
Renly Baratheon: Are you sure this won't hurt?
Loras Tyrell: Only if I slip.
Renly Baratheon: And you prefer me like this?
Loras Tyrell: Mhmm.
Renly Baratheon: If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.
Loras Tyrell: I want you.
Renly Baratheon: My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?
Loras Tyrell: Hold still.
Renly Baratheon: All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.
Loras Tyrell: You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
Renly Baratheon:His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
Loras Tyrell: He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
Renly Baratheon: Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
Renly Baratheon: I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.
Loras Tyrell: Yes well, I guess we'll never know.
Finished with Renly’s chest, Loras raises his arm so he can shave his armpit.
Renly Baratheon: Everywhere?
Loras Tyrell: Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
Renly Baratheon: It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.
Loras Tyrell: It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
Renly Baratheon: He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.
Loras Tyrell: I have an outrageous amount of money.
Renly Baratheon: Not as much as the Lannisters.
Loras Tyrell: But a lot more than you.
Renly Baratheon: Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King.
Loras Tyrell: Hmm... How did that ever happen?
Renly Baratheon: Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
Loras Tyrell: Do you know who should be King?
Renly Baratheon: Be serious.
Loras Tyrell: I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.
Renly Baratheon: I'm fourth in line.
Loras Tyrell: And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
Renly Baratheon: Stannis?
Loras Tyrell: Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
Renly Baratheon: He's still my older brother.
Loras cuts Renly under his arm.
Renly Baratheon: What are you doing?!
Loras Tyrell: Look at it.
Renly Baratheon: You cut me!
Loras Tyrell: It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you.
Loras Tyrell: You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.
Cersei enters King Robert’s chambers.
Cersei Baratheon: I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
Robert Baratheon: I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
Cersei Baratheon: Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.
Robert Baratheon: I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
Robert Baratheon: I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them.
Cersei Baratheon: The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
Robert Baratheon: It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.
Cersei Baratheon: Is my father wrong?
Robert Baratheon: Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.
Cersei Baratheon: We still outnumber them.
Cersei Baratheon: Five.
Robert Baratheon: Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.
Cersei Baratheon: What do you want?
Robert Baratheon: We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.
Cersei Baratheon: Our marriage.
The two begin laughing.
Robert Baratheon: Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?
Cersei Baratheon: Every day.
Robert Baratheon: How long can hate hold a thing together?
Cersei Baratheon: Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.
Robert Baratheon: Yes, it is.
Cersei Baratheon: Yes, it tis. What was she like?
Robert Baratheon: You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?
Cersei Baratheon: At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.
Robert Baratheon: So why now?
Cersei Baratheon: What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
Robert Baratheon: You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.
Cersei Baratheon: I felt something for you once, you know?
Robert Baratheon: I know.
Robert Baratheon: No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
Cersei Baratheon: It doesn't make me feel anything.
Inside one of Baelish’s brothels, Ned is speaking to one of the prostitutes. Jory and Baelish are in the next room.
Mhaegen: She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.
Eddard Stark: Aye.
Mhaegen: Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is.
Eddard Stark: I will.
Mhaegen: And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me.
Eddard Stark: When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?
Mhaegen: He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.
Eddard Stark: She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
Ned breaks off from Mhaegen and enters the same room as Baelish and Jory.
Petyr Baelish: Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink.
Eddard Stark: What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
Petyr Baelish: Well, he has more than you, for a start.
Eddard Stark: How many?
Petyr Baelish: Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.
Eddard Stark: And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
Petyr Baelish: He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
Eddard Stark: Come.
Jory is staring at one of the whores, who flashes him her breast.
Eddard Stark: Jory!
Jory Cassel: My Lord.
Ned and Jory leave the brothel with a few of Ned’s men. They are suddenly surround by Jaime Lannister and his men.
Jaime Lannister: Such a small pack of wolves.
Jory Cassel: Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!
Jaime Lannister: Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
Petyr Baelish: What's the meaning of this, Lannister?
Jaime Lannister: Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.
Eddard Stark: I remember him well.
Jaime Lannister: It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?
Eddard Stark:He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
Jaime draws his sword, causing all of them men on both sides to draw their swords, except for Eddard.
Petyr Baelish: My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
Jaime Lannister: Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.
Jory Cassel: If you threaten my Lord again...
Jaime Lannister: Threaten? As in, "I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?
Eddard Stark: You kill me, your brother's a dead man.
Jaime Lannister: You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
A fight erupts, first Jaime’s men throw spears straight into the chests of two of Ned’s men. Ned draws his sword and moves towards Jaime, fending off several guards in the process. Jory gets to Jaime first. Jaime stabs Jory with a dagger straight through his eye. The fighting ceases and Ned moves forward to Jaime, Jaime’s men all stop to watch the fight. The two fend each other off, as they break, one of Jaime’s guards stabs Ned in the back of the leg with a spear, causing him to fall to the ground. Jaime is openly frustrated and knocks the guard out. He mounts his horse.
Jaime Lannister: My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back.
Jaime rides off on horseback and his guards follow suit.
Opens at King’s Landing, assumed to be Ned’s quarters. He opens his eyes to find Cersei and King Robert at his bedside.
Eddard Stark: Your pardon, your Grace.
Cersei Baratheon: Do you know what your wife has done?
Eddard Stark:  She did nothing I did not command.
Robert Baratheon: Who’d have thought she had it in her?
Cersei Baratheon: By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
Eddard Stark:  I am the King’s Hand -
Cersei Baratheon: You were the King’s Hand!
Cersei Baratheon: You shall now be held accountable.
Robert Baratheon: Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you’ll make your peace with Jaime.
Eddard Stark: He butchered my men.
Cersei Baratheon: Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
Robert Baratheon: Quiet, woman.
Eddard Stark:  Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
Cersei Baratheon: I took you for a king.
Robert Baratheon: Hold your tongue.
Cersei Baratheon: He’s attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
Robert smacks Cersei.
Cersei Baratheon: I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
Robert Baratheon: Wear it in silence or I’ll honor you again.
Cersei exits the room, slamming the door shut behind her.
Robert Baratheon: See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.
Eddard Stark:  If we don’t act… there will be a war.
Robert Baratheon: So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King’s Landing. She’s had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.
Eddard Stark:  And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
Eddard Stark:  As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.
Robert Baratheon: Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I’m the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it’s true. You were the brother I chose. We’ll talk when I return from the hunt.
Robert throws the Hand of the King’s badge onto the bed where Ned is laying.
Eddard Stark: The hunt?
Robert Baratheon: Killing things clears my head. You’ll have to sit on the throne while I’m away. You’ll hate it more than I do.
Eddard Stark: The Targaryen girl -
Robert Baratheon: Seven hells! Don’t start with her again! The girl will die and I’ll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I’ll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister.
Robert exits the room, slamming the door shut behind him. Ned picks up the badge and looks at it.
Back at Vaes Dothrak across the sea, Daenerys is holding one of her prized dragon eggs. She looks up at a pot of coals inside of her tent. She walks over and places the egg into the coals. Irri walks into the tent.
Irri: Khaleesi?
Daenerys picks up the egg from the coals.
Irri: Oh, Khaleesi!
Irri takes the egg from her hands, dropping it instantly because of the heat. She looks at Daenerys’ hands and there are no burn marks. The two compare hands, Irri’s have burn marks.
Daenerys Targaryen: You’re hurt.
A raven caws. Bran is shooting his bow in the courtyard. The raven flies to the crypts of Winterfell, Bran follows. As he enters, again making eye contact with the bird. The raven flies deeper into the crypts. We then see Bran sleeping in his bed, showing that this was another vision, we hear footsteps running towards his door. His door swings opens and Bran sits up in bed breathing heavily. Hodor is carrying the contraption that Tyrion brought the blueprints for. Bran smiles. We then cut to the woods of Winterfell where Bran is shouting as he’s riding on the back of a horse.
Robb Stark: Not too fast.
Bran Stark: Come on, Dancer. (to his horse)
Theon Greyjoy: When are you gonna tell him?
Robb Stark: Not now.
Theon Greyjoy: Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
Robb Stark: You’re talking about war.
Theon Greyjoy: I’m talking about justice.
Robb Stark: Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
Theon Greyjoy: A Lannister put his spear through your father’s leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
Robb Stark:You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
Theon Greyjoy: You’re not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They’ve already started the war. It’s your duty to represent your House when your father can’t.
Robb Stark: And it’s not your duty, because it’s not your House.
It goes silent, Bran can no longer be heard jeering at his horse. Robb looks at Theon and stands up looking through the woods.
Robb Stark: Where’s Bran?
Theon Greyjoy: I don’t know. It’s not my House.
Theon stands up and walks away from Robb, who begins to look around. We cut to Bran riding slowly through the woods. We see someone creeping up behind him as his horse is nickering. As Bran enters a clearing, several Wildlings surround him.
Bran Stark: Robb?
Osha: All alone in the deep dark woods.
Bran Stark: I’m not alone, my brother is with me.
Wildling: I don’t see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
Osha: Oh, that’s a pretty pin. Silver.
Wildling: We’ll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.
Bran Stark: I can’t. The saddle, the straps.
Wildling: What’s wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
Bran Stark: I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don’t let me be, I’ll have you all killed!
Wildling 2: Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
Osha: the boy’s worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark’s own blood. Think what Mance would give us.
A Wildling is cutting Bran’s straps to his saddle, accidentally slicing into Bran’s leg but he feels no pain.
Wildling: Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We’re going as far south as south goes. There ain’t no white walkers down in Dorne.
Robb comes into view, behind the four Wildlings.
Robb Stark: Drop the knife. Let him go and I’ll let you live.
One of the Wildlings storms at Robb who evades an axe attack. Robb counters, slicing the Wildling’s throat. Osha charges Robb who tosses her spins her around by her hair. He fights off and kills the other Wildling. The Wilding in charge has Bran off of his horse with a knife at his throat, meanwhile Robb has Osha (female Wildling) and a knife to her throat.
Bran Stark: Robb!
Wildling: Shut up! Drop the blade!
Bran Stark: No, don’t.
Wildling: Do it.
Robb looks at Bran and then back up at the Wildling. He then slowly sets his sword on the ground, still gripping Osha by her hair. He looks back up at the Wildling who suddenly gets an arrow through his chest from his back. As he drops to the ground bleeding, we see Theona few yards behind him with a bow. The Wildling falls dead, Theon approaches. Robb releases Osha from his grasp as Theon walks over drawing his bow on her. Robb moves over to Bran.
Robb Stark: Are you all right?
Bran Stark: Yes, it doesn’t hurt.
Theon Greyjoy: Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you’re not a man until you’ve killed your first enemy. Well done.
Robb Stark: Have you lost your mind? What if you’d missed?
Theon Greyjoy: He would have killed you and cut Bran’s throat.
Robb Stark: You don’t have the right -
Theon Greyjoy: To what, to save your brother’s life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.
Robb Stark: What about her?
Osha: Give me my life, my lord, and I’m yours.
Robb Stark: We’ll keep her alive.
Osha gives a sigh of release, Theon releases his bow and Robb, holding Bran, assures that he’s okay.
Now at the Eyrie, Tyrion is sleeping and rolls to his side at the very edge of his skycell. He awakes, quickly moving back to the wall. He steps over to the door to his cell and begins pounding on it.
Tyrion Lannister: Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!
The door swings open and Mord rushes in, batting Tyrion to the opposite side of the cell.
Mord: Dwarf man making noise!
Tyrion Lannister: How would you like to be rich?
Mord: Dwarf man still making noise.
Tyrion Lannister: My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I’m prepared to give you lots of gold.
Mord quickly searches Tyrion’s pockets for gold.
Mord: No gold!
Tyrion Lannister: Well, I don’t have it here.
Mord: No gold! Fuck off.
Mord hits Tyrion once more with his club then storms out of the cell, shutting the door behind him.
Now in a hall at King’s Landing. We see Syrio shutting a door and holding two wooden swords. He slowly steps down towards Arya and tosses her one of the swords, she seamlessly catches it as he takes his fighting stance.
Arya Stark:  I don’t want to practice today.
Syrio Forel: No?
Arya Stark: They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don’t care about stupid wooden swords.
Syrio Forel: You are troubled.
Arya Stark:  Yes -
Syrio Forel: Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.
Arya Stark: I don’t like dolls and k -
Syrio Forel: You’re not here. You’re with your trouble. If you’re with your trouble when fighting happens…
Arya makes a move for Syrio, who quickly counters and puts her on her back.
Syrio Forel: … More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?
Syrio Forel: The old and the new.
Syrio steps back and tosses Arya her sword back, she catches it and assumes the counter position.
Back across the sea in Vaes Dothrak, we’re inside a large communal tent. Daenerys is centered around everyone and eating the heart of a horse a the Dothraki and a priest chant around her. Her husband Khal Drogo looks on in anticipation as she continues eating.
Viserys Targaryen: She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn’t my horse.
Jorah Mormont: She’s doing well.
Viserys Targaryen: She’ll never keep it down.
She keeps eating the heart, nearing the end. The Dothraki onlookers all chant in unison, getting louder and louder. The priestess is also chanting, louder and louder. Khal Drogo stares more intently at his wife, she stares back. The chanting grows louder, as does the priestess.
Viserys Targaryen: Tell me what she is saying.
Jorah Mormont: “The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”
The eating and chantines intensifies as Viserys looks on in shock.
Jorah Mormont: She’s going to have a boy.
Viserys Targaryen: He won’t be a real Targaryen. He won’t be a true dragon.
As the chanting is at it’s loudest, Daenerys has finished with the heart. Everyone looks on in anticipations, she wretches forward, on the verge of puking. The chanting suddenly halts. Khal Drogo leans in and looks intensly. Daenerys holds everything in and sobs. Her hands bloody, she slowly sits up, keeping everything in as she gulps the final bite. The priestess begins to speak, Jorah translates directly for Viserys.
Jora: “The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd.
Daenerys rises to her feet, speaking in Dothraki to the room.
Daenerys Targaryen: A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!
The room begins chanting, “Rhaego! Rhaego!” As the chanting grows louder and louder, Drogo stands up and walks up to Daenerys.
Viserys Targaryen: They love her.
The room’s chanting gets even louder. Drogo hugs his wife at her thighs and hoists her up, carrying her around the room.
Jorah Mormont: She truly is a queen today.
Jorah looks to his right towards Viserys, who has now slipped out. We cut to Daenerys’ tent. Inside, Viserys opens the container that holds her dragon eggs. He sighs and then puts them into a sack. Jorah walks into the tent behind him, blocking the door.
Jorah Mormont: Don’t let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
Viserys Targaryen: It’s not my law.
Jorah Mormont: They don’t belong to you.
Viserys Targaryen: Whatever is hers is also mine.
Jorah Mormont: Once, perhaps.
Jorah Mormont: And you have all three.
Viserys Targaryen: I need a large army… I’m the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don’t think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don’t think I know what you want? I don’t care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.
Jorah Mormont: You can go, but you can’t have the eggs.
Viserys Targaryen: You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
Jorah Mormont: It means everything to me.
Viserys Targaryen: And yet here you stand?
Jorah Mormont: And here I stand.
Viserys and Jorah stare at each other for a moment, before Viserys drops the sack containing the dragon eggs to the floor. Jorah steps aside, unblocking the exit. Viserys leaves.
Back at the skycell below the Eyrie. Tyrion is again shouting for Mord.
Tyrion Lannister: Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
Mord: Noise again!
Tyrion Lannister: About the gold -
Mord: No gold!
Tyrion Lannister: Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.
Mord: Where?
Tyrion Lannister: Where? I don’t know where, but when they free me -
Mord: You want free? Go be free. (points out of the skycell)
Tyrion Lannister: Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You’re a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.
Mord: What message?
Tyrion Lannister: Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
We cut to the throne room, where Lady Arryn and her son Robin are sitting on the throne, at the helm of the room. Catelyn is standing next to them, as Robin is tapping a knife against the throne itself very annoyingly.
Lysa Arryn: You wish to confess your crimes?
Tyrion Lannister: Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.
Lysa Arryn: Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man.
Tyrion Lannister: Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I’m a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I’m not particularly good at violence, but I’m good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle’s boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -
Lysa Arryn: Silence!
Robin Arryn:What happened next?!
Lysa Arryn: What do you think you’re doing?
Tyrion Lannister: Confessing my crimes.
Catelyn Stark: Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister’s husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.
Tyrion Lannister: Oh, I’m very sorry. I don’t know anything about all that.
Lysa Arryn: You’ve had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor.
Tyrion Lannister: Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King’s Justice? I’m accused and demand a trial.
Lysa Arryn: If you’re tried and found guilty, then by the king’s own laws you will pay with your life.
Tyrion Lannister: I understand the law.
Lysa Arryn: We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.
Several men begin unwinding a giant crank on one side of the room. In between Tyrion and the raised throne is what looks like a well. The well’s floor begins to open and wind comes howling through. Robin begins giggling and rapidly clapping his hands. Tyrion looks down and sees that it’s a great distance through this Moon Door to the ground, he would inevitably die if he had to go out this “door”.
Lysa Arryn: You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other.
Tyrion Lannister: No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
Subdued laughter fills the room, Catelyn and Lysa exchange looks.
Lysa Arryn: You have that right.
Knight 1: My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.
Knight 2: The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
Knight 3: I’ll fight for you, my Lady.
Knight 4: It’ll be my honor.
Knight 5: The honor should be mine.
Robin Arryn: Make the bad man fly!
Lysa Arryn: Ser Vardis… You’re quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?
Ser Vardis: With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
Tyrion Lannister: Agreed.
Lysa Arryn: You demanded a trial by combat.
Tyrion Lannister: Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.
Ser Vardis: My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp’s champion for you.
Tyrion Lannister: I wouldn’t be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.
The room shudders.
Lysa Arryn: The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
Tyrion Lannister: Send a raven for him, I’m happy to wait.
Lysa Arryn: The trial will be today.
Tyrion Lannister: Do I have a volunteer?
Again, the majority of the room laughs quietly.
Tyrion Lannister: Anyone?... Anyone?
Lysa Arryn: I think that we can assume that no one is willing -
Bronn: I’ll stand for the dwarf.
In the woods, outside of King’s Landing.
Lancel Lannister: More wine, your Grace?
Robert Baratheon: Oh, what was I saying?
Renly Baratheon: A simpler time.
Robert Baratheon: It was! It was. You’re too young to remember. Wasn’t it, Selmy?
Barriston: It was, your Grace.
Robert Baratheon: The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today.
Renly Baratheon: Sounds exhilarating.
Robert Baratheon: Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. (laughs) You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?
Renly Baratheon: Once, I think.
Robert Baratheon: You think? I think you’d remember. Back in our day, you weren’t a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”
Renly Baratheon: Those were some lucky girls.
Robert Baratheon: You ever make the eight, Barristan?
Barristan Selmy: I don’t believe so, your Grace.
Robert Baratheon: (laughs) Those were the days!
Renly Baratheon: What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?
Robert Baratheon: Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you’re speaking to the King.
Renly Baratheon: I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
Lancel Lannister: More wine, your Grace?
Renly walks off in the opposite direction of the group. Robert takes a large swig off of the wine and quickly continue walking.
In the throne room of King’s Landing. Ned sits upon the throne as a fill in for Robert, as he is Hand of the King. Baelish is at his right and Grand Maester Pycelle to his left. The room is filled with people.
Man: They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Brigands, most likely.
Man: They weren’t thieves, they didn’t steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace.
Grand Maester Pycelle: It’s the King’s Hand you’re addressing, not the king. The king is hunting.
A second man walks forward and empties a sack out onto the floor. It’s a pile of fish.
Eddard Stark:  These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner.
Man: None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I’ve ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.
Petyr Baelish: (whisper) That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
Eddard Stark:  You’re describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
Petyr Baelish: I’ve heard him called “Tywin Lannister’s mad dog.” I’m sure you have as well. (whispering to Ned) Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
Grand Maester Pycelle: If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king’s protection, it would be -
Petyr Baelish: It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
Grand Maester Pycelle: Wel…
Eddard Stark:  I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion.
Beric Dondarrion steps from the back of the room forward.
Eddard Stark:  You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor’s keep.
Beric Dondarrion: As you command.
Ned stands up with the assistance of a cane. He steps forward.
Eddard Stark:  In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.
Grand Maester Pycelle: My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert’s return.
Eddard Stark:  Grand Maester Pycelle.
Grand Maester Pycelle: My Lord.
Eddard Stark:  Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.
The men all bow their heads in acknowledgement. Ned steps down from the throne, Baelish follows him, speaking only to Ned.
Petyr Baelish: A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion’s tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers.
Eddard Stark: Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
Robin Arryn: Is it over?
Lysa Arryn: You don’t fight with honor!
Bronn: No. He did.
Tyrion turns to Mord who uncuffs him.
Robin Arryn: Can I make the little man fly now?
Tyrion Lannister: Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
Rodrik Cassel tosses Tyrion his purse. Tyrion bows before Catelyn, begins walking out, Bronn following. He tosses Mord the purse full of coins.
Tyrion Lannister: A Lannister always pays his debts.
At King’s Landing, Sansa Stark and Septa Mordane, both sowing.
Mordane: You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
Sansa Stark: Well, why shouldn’t I? We’re in the south.
Mordane: It’s important to remember where you come from. I’m not sure your mother would like these new styles.
Sansa Stark: My mother isn’t from the North.
Mordane: I’m aware of that.
Sansa Stark: Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
Mordane: Yes. I have hair.
Sansa Stark: I’ve never seen it.
Mordane: Would you like to?
Sansa Stark: No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?
Mordane: I come from a very small village in -
Sansa Stark: Oh, wait. I just realized… I don’t care.
Mordane: Sansa -
Sansa Stark: Septa.
Mordane: Now you are being rude.
A door can be heard closing. Prince Joffrey walks in. Sansa’s eyes light up as both women stand up.
Mordane: My prince.
Sansa Stark: My prince.
Joffrey Baratheon:  My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
Joffrey offers Sansa a necklace. She turns around, for him to put it on her, as acceptance.
Sansa Stark: It’s beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
Joffrey Baratheon:  You’ll be queen one day, it’s only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?
Sansa Stark: There’s nothing to forgive.
Joffrey Baratheon: You’re my lady. One day we’ll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them.  I’ll never disrespect you again. I’ll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You’re my lady now, from this day, until my last day.
The two share their first kiss.
In the woods outside of Winterfell, Theon is riding his horse, alone. He comes to a road and sees a carriage leaving, Ros on the back of it riding south.
Theon Greyjoy: Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
Ros: Going to King’s Landing.
Theon Greyjoy: In a turnip cart?
Ros: I’ll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
Theon Greyjoy: And you can afford that?
Ros: Some of my friends are more generous than others.
Theon Greyjoy: There’s a thousand girls like you in King’s Landing.
Ros: I’ll have lots of company…
Theon Greyjoy: Yes, you’ll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can’t get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.
Ros: (laughs) And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?
Theon Greyjoy: Don’t be a fool.
Ros: I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King’s Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there’s nothing more for me here. Let’s go, Steffon.
Theon Greyjoy: Let me see it one more time?
Ros: See what?
The carriage is driving away from Theon, he scrambles and flips Ros a coin. She catches it and lifts up her dress one final time for Theon, while laughing.
Theon Greyjoy: I’m going to miss you!
Ros: I know.
At King’s Landing in Ned’s quarters. Arya and Sansa await as their father limps forward, using his cane for assistance.
Eddard Stark:  I’m sending you both back to Winterfell.
Sansa Stark: What?!
Eddard Stark:  Listen -
Sansa Stark: What about Joffrey?
Arya Stark:  Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you’re sending us home?
Eddard Stark:  What? No.
Sansa Stark: Please, Father. Please don’t.
Arya Stark:  You can’t. I’ve got my lessons with Syrio. I’m finally getting good.
Eddard Stark:  This isn’t a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
Arya Stark:  Can’t we take Syrio back with us?
Sansa Stark: Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can’t go. I’m supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I’m meant to be his queen and have his babies.
Arya Stark: Seven hells.
Eddard Stark:  When you’re old enough, I’ll make you a match with someone who’s worthy of you, someone who’s brave and gentle and strong -
Sansa Stark: I don’t want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He’ll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I’ll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
Arya Stark: The lion’s not his sigil, idiot. He’s a stag, like his father.
Sansa Stark: He is not. He’s nothing like that old drunk king.
Eddard Stark:  Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things.
Sansa Stark: Wait!
Arya Stark:  Come on! (dragging Sansa)
Sansa Stark: It’s not fair!
The two exit Ned’s room and close the door behind them. Ned slowly makes his way over to his desk, opening the book that Grand Maester Pycelle had given him earlier. The book covers the lineages of all the great Houses of Westeros. Ned turns and reviews the Baratheon page, reading out loud.
Eddard Stark:  “Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.” “Axel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.” “Robert Baratheon, black of hair.” “Joffrey Baratheon… golden-haired.”
Ned has a revelation and closes the book.
Back at Vaes Dothrak, in a very large hut. It is a celebration. A pig roasts over a center fire as there are drums being played and people dancing everywhere. Viserys stumbles in, clearly drunk.
Viserys Targaryen: Daenerys! Where’s my sister?
Daenerys and Jorah both look up, noticing her brother on the opposite side of the hut. Drogo, on another side of the hut also sees Viserys. Jorah stands up and begins walking towards Viserys.
Daenerys Targaryen: Stop him.
Viserys Targaryen: Where is she? I’m here for the feast. The whore’s feast.
Jorah Mormont: Come.
Viserys Targaryen: Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!
A man sitting next to Drogo says something in Dothraki that makes the Khal laugh. Viserys hears this and spins around.
Viserys Targaryen: Khal Drogo! I’m here for the feast.
Khal Drogo: (speaks Dothraki, motions to the other side of the hut)
Jorah Mormont: Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
Viserys Targaryen: That is no place for a king.
Khal Drogo:  You are no king.
Viserys draws his sword, Jorah moves forward, Viserys holds his sword at Jorah.
Viserys Targaryen: Keep away from me!
The drums stop and now everyone in the hut is paying attention.
Daenerys Targaryen: Viserys, please.
Viserys Targaryen: There she is.
Jorah Mormont: Put the sword down. They’ll kill us all.
Viserys Targaryen: They can’t kill us. They can’t shed blood in their sacred city. (moving his sword over everyone in the room, stopping on Daenerys’ stomach) But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.
The Khal is fiercely looking at the situation as Viserys has his blade to Daenerys’ stomach. A woman is translating for Drogo as Viserys speaks.
Viserys Targaryen: Tell him I want what was bargained for or I’m taking you back. He can keep the baby. I’ll cut it out and leave it for him.
Khal Drogo:  (speaks Dothraki)
Viserys Targaryen: What’s he saying?
Daenerys Targaryen: He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold.
Viserys Targaryen: That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.
Viserys takes his blade away from Daenerys’ stomach and steps back, smiling. Drogo stands up and walks to his wife, placing his hand on her belly as they exchange looks. The Khal says something in Dothraki, two men instantly come up behind Viserys, each holding one of his arms. One man breaks Viserys’ right arm as he screams.
Viserys Targaryen: No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!
The two men force Viserys to the ground, still holding him by his arms. The Khal moves towards them and mutters something in Dothraki. A woman tips over a kettle that was over the fire, pouring out it’s contents. Drogo throws some golden jewelry into the kettle.
Jorah Mormont: Look away Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen: No.
Viserys Targaryen: No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can’t!
The golden jewelry is now melted down into liquid. Khal Drogo lifts the kettle up and walks over towards the screaming Viserys.
Viserys Targaryen: Dany please!
Khal Drogo: A crown for a king.
Khal Drogo raises the kettle over Viserys’ head and pours out the melted gold onto his skull. He screams as the hot liquid solidifies on his skull, the two men release Viserys, he instantly falls to the ground dead.
Jorah Mormont: Khaleesi…
Daenerys Targaryen: He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.
Trumpets sounds from the Lannister camp. Going inside a tent, we see Tywin Lannister sharpening his knifes, preparing to skin a deer, while Jaime Lannister starts reading the received letter from Ned Stark.
Jaime Lannister:  "Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"
Uh, "arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown."
Poor Ned Stark. Brave man, terrible judgment.
Tywin Lannister:  Attacking him was stupid.
Tywin Lannister:  Lannisters don't act like fools.
Are you gonna say something clever? Go on, say something clever.
Jaime Lannister:  Catelyn Stark took my brother.
Tywin Lannister:  Why is he still alive?
Jaime Lannister:  Tyrion?
Tywin Lannister:  Ned Stark.
Jaime Lannister:  One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
Tywin Lannister:  Why is he still alive?
Jaime Lannister:  It wouldn't have been clean.
Tywin Lannister:  Clean...
Tywin Lannister:  You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
Jaime Lannister:  I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
Tywin Lannister:  Now that's what you want people to think of you.
Jaime Lannister:  It's the truth.
Tywin Lannister: When you hear them whispering "Kingslayer" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?
Jaime Lannister:  Of course it bothers me.
Tywin Lannister:  The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness.
I'm giving you half of our forces. 30,000 men.
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.
Jaime Lannister:  I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
Tywin Lannister:  He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.
And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.
Jaime Lannister:  So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..
Tywin Lannister:  No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!
If another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a House to be feared.
Your mother's dead. Before long I'll be dead.
And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children.
All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground. It's the family name that lives on. It's all that lives on.
Not your personal glory, not your honor, but family.
Do you understand?
Jaime nods gently.
Tywin Lannister:  Hmm.
You're blessed with abilities that few men possess.
You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms.
And you are still blessed with youth.
And what have you done with these blessings, huh? You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings.
One a madman, the other a drunk.
The future of our family will be determined in these next few months.
We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.
Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did.
I need you to become a man you were always meant to be.
Not next year. Not tomorrow. Now.
Submissive as he looks, Jaime walks out of the tent.
Back at a garden in Kings Landing, we see Queen Cersei approaching the sitting Ned Stark.
Cersei Lannister:  You're in pain.
Ned Stark:  I've had worse, my lady.
Cersei Lannister:  Perhaps it's time to go home.
Ned Stark:  The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
Ned Stark:  I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
Cersei Lannister:  Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?
Ned Stark:  Has he done this before?
Cersei Lannister:  Jaime would have killed him.
Cersei Lannister:  My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
Ned Stark:  Your brother Or your lover?
Cersei Lannister:  The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
Cersei Lannister:  Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.  We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
Ned Stark:  My son saw you with him.
Cersei Lannister:  Do you love your children?
Ned Stark:  With all my heart.
Cersei Lannister:  No more than I love mine.
Ned Stark:  And they are all Jaime's.
Cersei Lannister:  Thank the Gods.
In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways.
In the morning, he doesn't remember.
Ned Stark:  You've always hated him.
Cersei Lannister:  Hated him? I worshiped him.
Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath.
And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life.
Then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, "Lyanna".
Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me.
Ned Stark:  When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.
You must be gone by then. You and your children.
I will not have their blood on my hands.
Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can.
Because wherever you go, Robert's wrath will follow you.
Cersei Lannister:  And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself.
Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell.
He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up.
All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself.
Such a sad mistake.
Ned Stark:  I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.
Cersei Lannister:  Oh, but it was.
When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.
Cersei walks off.
Littlefinger is looking outside his brothel window. Seeing mothers bathing their crying children.Seemingly in thought, he decides to close it. Meanwhile, Ros and Ameca are playing with each other, while Ros is loudly moaning.
Ros:  Come here.
Oh yes, oh. Oh yes yes yes.
Ros:  Yes, My Lord.
Petyr Baelish:  Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman.
Well, go ahead. Slowly.
You're not fooling them. They just paid you. They know what you are.
They know it's all just an act.
Your job is to make them forget what they know.
That takes time. You need to Ease into it.
Go ahead. Ease into it.
He's winning you over in spite of yourself.
You're starting to like this.
He wants to believe you.
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?
He knows he's better than other men.
He's always known it deep down inside. Now he has proof.
He's so good, he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there.
Overcoming your very nature.
Ros:  Why don't you join us, My Lord?
Petyr Baelish:  I'm saving myself for another.
Ros:  What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Petyr Baelish:  A stupid saying.
What we don't know is usually what gets us killed.
Ros:  She must be very beautiful.
Petyr Baelish:  No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though.
Ros:  I do believe my lord's in love.
Petyr Baelish:  For many years. Most of my life really.
Play with her ass.
And she loved me too. I was her little confidant, her plaything.
She could tell me anything, anything at all.
She told me about all the horses that she liked.
The castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry.
A northerner with a jaw like an anvil.
So I challenged him to a duel. I mean, why not? I'd read all the stories.
The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.
In the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me.
"He's just a boy", she said. "Please don't hurt him".
So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went.
Ros:  Is she still married to him?
Petyr Baelish:  Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.
And she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen.
She loves him, I'm afraid.
And why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him? He's just so...good.
Do you know what I learned, losing that duel? I learned that I'll never win. Not that way.
That's their game, their rules. I'm not going to fight them.
I'm going to fuck them. That's what I know. That's what I am.
And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.
Ros:  And what do you want?
Petyr Baelish:  Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is.
Now wash yourselves. Both of you are working tonight.
Hmm.
While Ros and Ameca are both walking out, Littlefinger watches them leave.
Back at Winterfell, Osha is walking into a stable, carrying a bale of straw. While bending over and laying down the bale of sraw, Theon Grayjoy arrives.
Theon Greyjoy:  You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
Where I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals.
Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord, at low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes. The sea would come in closer and closer.
You'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time.
Osha:  Where is it you come from?
Theon Greyjoy:  The Iron Islands.
Osha:  They far away?
Theon Greyjoy:  You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
Osha:  Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.
Theon Greyjoy:  Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore.
In civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles.
Osha:  And what's that?
Theon Greyjoy:  Lord.
Osha:  Why?
Theon Greyjoy:  Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.
Osha:  What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?
Theon Greyjoy:  I will be lord after my father.
Osha:  So you're not lord now?
Theon Greyjoy:  No, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?
Osha:  I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.
Theon Greyjoy:  I'm not a Southerner.
Osha:  You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
Theon Greyjoy:  You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?
Osha:  Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what "impunent" means.
Theon Greyjoy:  Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
Do you want to lose that chain?
Maester Luwin:  Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
Theon Greyjoy:  I thought she was our prisoner.
Maester Luwin:  Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
Agitated as he is, Theon runs off.
Maester Luwin:  Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
Osha:  I'm used to worse than him.
Osha:  I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
Maester Luwin:  Why did you come here?
Osha:  Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.
As far South as South goes, before the long night comes.
Maester Luwin:   Why? What are you afraid of?
Osha:  There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
Maester Luwin:   Owls and Shadowcats and...
Osha:  I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.
Osha:  They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping.
And they ain't sleeping no more.
Seeing the wall from above, we see Jon and Sam walking towards the edge.
Samwell Tarly:  I miss girls.
Not even talking to them. I never talked to them.
Just looking at them, hearing them giggle.
Don't you miss girls?
Both Jon and Sam are looking down and see a galloping horse.
Riders. The horn. We have to blow the horn.
Jon Snow:  Why is he alone?
Samwell Tarly:  One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for...
Jon Snow:  There's no rider.
While the Wall's gate is being opened, the horse gallops inside the tunnel. Jon and Sam are rushing down, while the stable boy has caught the horse, bringing him towards Jon, Sam and Jeor Mormont.
Night Watch stable boy:  Whoa, boy, whoa.
Jon Snow:  That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
Where's my Uncle?
Returning to Kings Landing, we see Ned and Tomard walking down a hallway. Renly running towards them calling...
Renly Baratheon:  Ned! It's Robert.
We were hunting...a boar...
Surprised yet being shocked as he is, Ned walks towards Robert's chambers. Inside Robert's room, we see Cersei, Joffrey, Barristan Selmy and Maester Pycelle are all present. Robert speaks to joffrey, whom is sitting beside him.
Robert Baratheon:  I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.
I was never meant to be a father.
Go on. You don't want to see this.
Joffrey walks out of the room.
Robert Baratheon:  My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust.
It stinks. It stinks like death. Don't think I can't smell it.
I paid the bastard back, Ned. I drove my knife right through his brain.
You ask them if I didn't. Ask them!
I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.
And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me.
Now leave us, the lot of you. I need to talk to Ned.
Cersei Lannister:  Robert, my sweet...
Robert Baratheon:  Out, all of you!
On Robert's demand, everyone left except for Ned. As soon as the door shuts, Ned talks to Robert.
Ned Stark:  You damned fool.
Robert Baratheon:  Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say.
"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of..." you know how it goes. Fill in the damn titles.
"I hereby command Eddard of House Stark" titles, titles.
"To serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my death.
To rule in my stead, until my son Joffrey comes of age".
Give it over.
Ned hands over the letter and quill. It is seen that Robert's signs the letter with his autograph.
Robert Baratheon:  Give it to the council after I'm dead.
At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.
You'll rule now. You'll hate it worse than I did, but you'll do it well.
The girl, Daenerys. You were right. Varys, Littlefinger, my brother. Worthless.
No one to tell me "no" but you. Only you.
Let her live. Stop it, if it's not too late.
Ned Stark:  I will.
Robert Baratheon:  And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me.
Ned Stark:  I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.
Robert Baratheon:  My memory.
King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig.
Give me something for the pain and let me die.
Ned walks out of Robert's chamber. Maester Pycelle, Renly, Varys and Barristan Selmy are waiting outside.
Ned Stark:  Give him milk of the poppy.
Both Maester Pycelle as Renly re-enter Robert's chamber. Still outside a conversation occurs.
Barristan Selmy:  He was reeling from the wine.
He commanded us to step aside, but I failed him.
Ned Stark:  No man could have protected him from himself.
Lord Varys:  I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?
Barristan Selmy:  His squire, from the king's own skin.
Ned Stark:  His squire? The Lannister boy?
Lord Varys:  Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.
I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.
Ned Stark:  His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
Whatever arrangements you made, unmake them. At once.
Lord Varys:  I'm afraid those birds have flown.
The girl is likely dead already.
Ned walks off.
Entering Khal Drogo's tent, Daenerys is braiding Khal Drogo's hair. The conversation is spoken in the Dothraki language.
Khal Drogo:  The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs.
Daenerys Stormborn:  According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world.
Khal Drogo:  The earth ends at the black salt sea. No horse can cross the poison water.
Daenerys Stormborn:  The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea.
The dirt where I was born.
Khal Drogo:  Not dirt. Lands.
Daenerys Stormborn:  Lands, yes...
There are thousands of ships in the free cities. Wooden horses that fly across the sea.
Khal Drogo:  Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
Daenerys Stormborn:  It's not a chair. It's a... Throne
Khal Drogo:  Throne?
Daenerys Stormborn:  A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen.
Khal Drogo:  A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.
Khal Drogo kisses Daenerys and walks out of the tent.
A while later, at one of Vaes Dothrak's markets, Daenerys walks with Jorah Mormont.
Daenerys Stormborn:  Can't you help me make him understand?
Jorah Mormont:  The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.
Have patience, Khaleesi. We will go home, I promise you.
Daenerys Stormborn:  My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.
Have I said something funny, Ser?
Jorah Mormont:  Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.
He had no right to them. He seized them because he could.
Daenerys Stormborn:  And because he had dragons.
Jorah Mormont:  Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.
Daenerys Stormborn:  You don't believe it.
Jorah Mormont:  Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report.
As for the rest It was 300 years ago. Who knows what really happened?
Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant Captain, see if he has any letters for me.
Deanerys Targarian: Well, I'll come with you.
Jorah Mormont:  No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough.
Jorah walks by a few merchants, while a little child is calling him.
Little Bird:  Psst, Jorah the Andal.
The spider sends his greetings and his congratulations.
A royal pardon. You can go home now.
Jorah seems to have a change of heart. Meanwhile a merchant is heard from afar.
Wine Merchant:  Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!
Sweet reds! I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor!
Tyrosh pear brandy! Andalish sours! I have them! I have them!
Danaerys approaches the merchant
Wine Merchant:  A taste for the Khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.
One taste and you'll name your first child after me.
Daenerys Stormborn:  My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.
Just a taste.
Wine Merchant:  My Lady, you are from Westeros.
Doreah:  You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen.
Khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.
Wine Merchant:  Princess.
Daenerys Stormborn:  Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
Wine Merchant:  That? Dornish swill.
Not worthy of a princess. I have a dry red from the Arbor. Nectar of the Gods.
Let me give you a cask. Uh... a gift.
Daenerys Stormborn:  You honor me, Ser.
Wine Merchant:  The honor...the honor is all mine.
Rakharo:  Huh-uh, huh-uh.
Rakharo pulls the cask out of the merchants hands.
Wine Merchant:  You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.
Daenerys Stormborn:  I hope to repay your kindness someday.
Jorah Mormont:  Rakharo.
Rakharo:  Huh.
Jorah Mormont:  Put down that cask.
Daenerys Stormborn:  Is something wrong?
Jorah Mormont:  I have a thirst. Open it.
Wine Merchant:  The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
Jorah Mormont:  Open it.
The wine merchant obeys and opens the cask.
Jorah Mormont:  Pour.
Wine Merchant:  It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
Daenerys Stormborn:  Do as he says.
Wine Merchant:  As the princess commands.
The wine merchant poors the wine into a cup.
Wine Merchant:  Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord.
Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue.
Jorah Mormont:  You first.
Wine Merchant:  Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares.
Daenerys Stormborn:  You will drink.
The wine merchant takes Jorah's cup. Looks both Jorah and Daenerys innocently in their eyes, while making a toasting gesture.
As soon as his lips touches his cup, he drops it and tries to flee.
Doreah:  Khaleesi! Stop him!
After a very short chase, Rakharo was able to capture the wine merchant, grabbing the merchants leg with his whip.
Jorah grabs Daenerys's arm.
Jorah Mormont:  Come.
At the Wall we see Jeor Mormont speaking towards his brothers of the Night's Watch.
Jeor Mormont:  You came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, killers, thieves.
You came alone, in chains, without friends nor honor.
You came to us rich and you came to us poor.
Some of you bear the names of proud houses, others only bastard names or no names at all.
It does not matter. All that, is in the past.
Here, on the wall, are all one house.
Tonight...
Samwel Tarly:  You're allowed to look happy.
You're going to be a Ranger.
Isn't that what you always wanted?
Jon Snow:  I want to find my Uncle.
I know he's alive out there. I know he is.
Samwell Tarly:  I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger.
It's the steward's life for me.
Samwell Tarly:  There's honor in being a steward.
Not much, really. But there's food.
Jeor Mormont:  Here you begin anew.
A man of The Night's Watch lives his life for the realm.
Not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house or that house.
Not for gold nor glory nor a woman's love. But for the realm! And all the people in it.
You've all learned the words of the vow.
Think carefully before you say them.
The penalty for desertion, is death.
You can take your vows here tonight, at sunset.
Do any of you still keep the old Gods?
Jon Snow stands.
Jon Snow:  I do, my lord.
Jeor Mormont:  You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.
Jon Snow:  Yes, my lord.
Jeor Mormont:  You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe.
Samwell Tarly:  my lord, might I go as well?
Jeor Mormont:  Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
Samwell Tarly:  No, my lord.
I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him.
Alliser ThorneL  Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house?
Samwell Tarly:  The Night's Watch is my house now.
The Seven have never answered my prayers. Perhaps the old Gods will.
Jeor Mormont:  As you wish, lad.
You've all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths.
Halder to the builders. Pyp to the stewards. Toad to the builders.
Grenn to the Rangers. Samwell to the stewards. Matthar to the Rangers.
Dareon to the stewards. Balian to the Rangers. Rast to the Rangers.
Jon to the stewards. Rancer to the builders. Echiel to the builders.
Gordo to the stewards. Niko to the Rangers. Escan to the Rangers.
Vorkoy to the builders. Joby to the stables. Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders. Nelugo to the Rangers.
May all the Gods preserve you.
Jaremy Rykker:  Rangers with me.
Othell Yarwyck:  Builders!
Everyone walks to their designated leader. Sam, Jon and Pyp walk towards Maester Aemon and await their tasks.
Maester Aemon:  Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.
Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.
Luke, report to one-eyed Joe in the stables.
Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch.
Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive. Make no comment about his nose.
Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward.
Jon Snow:  Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
Maester Aemon:  Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.
Change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.
Jon Snow:  Do you take me for a servant?
Maester Aemon:  We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.
But perhaps we were wrong in that.
Jon Snow:  May I go?
Maester Aemon:  As you wish.
Jon walks away, while Sam and Pyp follow him.
Samwell Tarly:  Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?
Jon Snow:  I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.
He wanted it and he got it.
Stewards are nothing but maids! I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you! It's not fair.
Pypar:  Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver.
So now I'm here. At the end of the world with no one to sing for, but old men and little shits like you.
I'll never see my family again. I'll never be inside a woman again.
So don't tell me about fair.
Samwell Tarly:  I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
Pypar:  You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
Samwell Tarly:  Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.
Angrily Pyp walks off. Sam talks to Jon.
Samwell Tarly:  Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.
You'll be with him day and night.
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle.
You'll know everything, be part of everything. And he asked for you himself.
He wants to groom you for command.
Jon Snow:  I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger.
Samwell Tarly:  I always wanted to be a Wizard.
Jon laughs out loud.
What? No, I'm serious.
So you'll stay and say your words with me?
In Kings Landing we see Ned Stark walking with his guards, while Renly approaches.
Renly Baratheon:  Lord Stark, a moment.
Alone if you will.
Renly Baratheon:  He named you Protector of the Realm.He did.
Renly Baratheon:  She won't care.
Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.
Ned Stark:  And what should I do with a hundred swords?
Renly Baratheon:  Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.
We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody.
Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom.
Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.
By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.
Ned Stark:  What about Stannis?
Renly Baratheon:  Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
You have odd notions about protecting the realm.
Ned Stark:  Stannis is your older brother.
Renly Baratheon:  This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.
What's best for the Kingdoms? What's best for the people we rule? We all know what Stannis is.
He inspires no love or loyalty. He's not a King. I am.
Ned Stark:  Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
Renly Baratheon:  Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert.
Tell me something: Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
Ned Stark:  I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
Ned walks off to his chamber, while Renly is left behind agitated.
Entering Ned Starks chamber, we see him writing a letter to Stannis. Giving orders to Tomard.
Ned Stark:  You will sail to dragonstone tonight.
You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.
Not his steward, not his Captain of the guard, and not his wife.
Only Stannis himself.
Tomard:  Yes, My Lord.
Littlefinger enters the room
Ned Stark:  Now leave us.
Tomard follows Ned's command and leaves his chamber. Littlefingers starts off the conversation.
Petyr Baelish:  My Lord protector.
Ned Stark:  The King has no true born sons.
Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards.
Petyr Baelish:  So when the King dies...
Ned Stark:  The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
Petyr Baelish:  So it would seem. Unless...
Ned Stark:  There is no "unless".
He is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that.
Petyr Baelish:  And he cannot take the throne without your help.
You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.
Ned Stark:  Do you have a shred of honor?
Petyr Baelish:  You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
All of the power is yours. You need only reach out and take it.
Make peace with the Lannisters. Release the Imp. Wed your daughter to Joffrey.
We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis.
And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead.
Ned Stark:  We?
Petyr Baelish:  You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest.
Ned Stark:  What you suggest is treason.
Petyr Baelish:  Only if we lose.
Ned Stark:  Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy.
Petyr Baelish:  We only make peace with our enemies, my Lord.
That's why it's called "making peace".
Ned Stark:  No. I won't do it.
Petyr Baelish:  So it will be Stannis and war?
Ned Stark:  There is no other choice. He is the heir.
Petyr Baelish:  So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly.
Ned Stark:  You promised Catelyn you would help me.
The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms.
Enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard. I need the gold cloaks.
The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the King's peace.
Petyr Baelish:  Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
You know it has to be done, but it's not honorable so the words stick in your throat.
When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect?
Who do they follow?
The man who pays them.
Back at the Wall, we see Jon, Sam and Ghost, walking with a few Night's Watch brothers, on their way to the Weirwood tree.
Upon arrival, they're taking their vows.
Both Jon and Sam:  Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.
Night gathers and now my watch begins.
It shall not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post.
I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
I pledge my life and honor to The Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
Othell Yarwyck:  You knelt as boys.
Rise now as men of The Night's Watch.
Fellow Night's Watch brothers:  Well done. Well done.
Ghost suddenly appears and is holding onto something.
Samwell Tarly:  What's he got there?
Jon SnowL  To me, Ghost. Bring it here.
It appeared that Ghost was holding a frozen hand.
Samwell Tarly:  Gods be good!
Returning to a tent in Vaes Dothrak, both Daenarys and Jorah are having a conversation, while walking past the captured wine merchant.
Daenerys Stormborn:  What will they do to him?
When the Khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle, forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.
Daenerys Stormborn:  And when he falls?
I saw a man last nine miles once.
Daenerys Stormborn:  King Robert still wants me dead.This poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.
Daenerys Stormborn:  I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone.
He will never leave you alone.
If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you.
If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him.
He will never abandon the hunt.
You're a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
Your son will have Targaryen blood with 40,000 riders behind him.
Daenerys Stormborn:  He will not have my son.
He will not have you either, Khaleesi.
Khal Drogo enters the tent with a couple of his men. After staring at the scared merchant, he walks towards Daenarys
Khal Drogo:  Moon of my life. Are you hurt?
Daenarys gently shakes her head in disapproval. Khal Drogo kisses Daenarys's forehead and talks to Jorah.
Khal Drogo:  Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did.
Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.I make this gift to you.
And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world. I will also pledge a gift.I will give him the iron chair, that his mother's father sat upon.
I will give him Seven Kingdoms. I Drogo, will do this.
I will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends and ride wooden horses across the black salt water as no Khal has done before.
I will kill the men in iron suits and tear down their stone houses.
I will rape their women, take their children as slaves and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak.
This, I vow. I, Drogo, son of Bharbo. I swear before the Mother of Mountains as the stars look down in witness!
As the stars look down in witness!
The Khalasar is moving out of Vaes Dothrak, riding underneath the Horse Gate.
Just as Jorah predicted, the wine merchant is leashed to one of the horses saddles, covered with dirt, struggling to move on.
In Kings Landing Ned stark walks with his men, while being called by a messenger.
Messenger:  Lord Stark!
Varly:  Stop!
Ned Stark:  No, all right.
It's all right. Let him through.
Messenger:  Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room.
Ned Stark:  King Joffrey?
Messenger:  King Robert is gone.
The Gods give him rest.
Ned seems petrified by the news. Shortly after, Ned arrives close-by the Throne room, where Littlefinger, Varys and a few Stark men await him.
Petyr Baelish:  All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.
Ned Stark:  Good. Is Lord Renly joining us?
Lord Varys:  I fear Lord Renly has left the city.
He rode through the old gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50 retainers.
Last seen galloping South in some haste.
When moving on, affront of the Throne room, Janos Slynt and the Gold Cloaks await Ned.
Janos Slynt:  We stand behind you, Lord Stark.
Messenger:  All hail his Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
King Joffrey:  I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.
I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.
Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councilors.
Ned Stark:  Ser Barristan, I believe no man here could ever question your honor.
Barristan Selmy:  King Robert's seal. Unbroken.
"Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm, to rule as Regent until the heir come of age".
Cersei Lannister:  May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?
Protector of the realm. Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark? A piece of paper?
Cersei shreds Robert's letter to pieces
Barristan Selmy:  Those were the King's words.
Cersei Lannister:  We have a new King now.
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel.
Allow me to return the courtesy. Bend the knee, My Lord.
Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son and we shall allow you to live out your days in the gray waste you call home.Your son has no claim to the throne.
King Joffrey:  Liar!
Cersei Lannister:  You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.
Ned Stark:  Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.
Cersei Lannister:  You think he stands alone?
Cregor Clegane draws his sword.
King Joffrey:  Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!
Ned Stark:  Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.
Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.
Janos Slynt:  Men of the Watch!
The Gold Cloaks draw their swords.
Ned Stark:  I want no bloodshed.
Tell your men to lay down their swords. No one needs to die.
Petyr Baelish:  Now!
Suddenly, the Gold Cloaks switch sides and attack the Stark men. Littlefinger sneaks up to Ned Stark.
He grabs him from behind, then holds a dagger to his throat, saying...
Petyr Baelish:  I did warn you not to trust me.
Entering King's Landing, we see Syrio Forel dancing with Arya.
Syrio Forel:  Yah! Left high, left low.
How ironic it seems, how peacefully Arya and Syrio are dancing, near the Throne room, the Kings Guard fights a few Stark men.
Going back again at Arya's dancing training.
Syrio Forel:  Right low, lunge right.
Outside in a courtyard, a few Stark stewards are packing and bringing out the Stark family's belongings.
Steward of House Stark:  If you break anything, the Septa will have my head. What is...
The stewards are being slaughtered by the Kingsguard.
Going back inside the Red Keep, Sansa is walking down a hallway with her Septa.
Septa Mordane:  Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
How she could forget...
Sansa Stark:  She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning. She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She's so clumsy.
Septa Mordane:  Hush! Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
Sansa Stark:  What is it? What's happening?
Septa Mordane:  Do as I told you. Run!
Back at Arya's training.
Syrio Forel:  This way! Left, right.
Rah! Now you are dead.
Arya Stark:  You said right, but you went left.
Syrio Forel:  And now you are a dead girl.
Arya Stark:  Only 'cause you lied.
Syrio Forel:  My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.
Arya Stark:  I was so. I watched, but you...
Syrio Forel:  Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
The Kingsguard approaches.
Meryn Trant:  Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
Syrio Forel:  And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.
Meryn Trant:  Mind your place, dancing master.
This is no concern of yours.
Arya Stark:  My father wouldn't send you.
As she picks up her wooden stick from the ground, she says.
Arya Stark:  And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Maryn Trant:  Take her.
Syrio Forel:  Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Kings guard:  Get out of my way, little man.
Syrio Forel:  I am Syrio Forel.
Kings guard:  Foreign bastard.
The Kings guard draws his sword. Before he can strike, Syrio hits him with his wooden stick. Knocking him out.
Syrio Forel:  And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Meryn Trant:  Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.
Syrio Forel:  Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Syrio Forel fights three Kings guards at once, eventually knocking them all out.
Meryn Trant:  Bloody oafs.
Syrio Forel:  Be gone now, Arya.
Arya Stark:  Come with me. Run.
Syrio Forel:  The first sword of Braavos does not run.
Meryn Trant strikes Syrio, a short duel takes place. Eventually Meryn Trant cuts Syrio Forel's wooden sword into pieces.
Syrio Forel:  What do we say to the God of death?
Arya Stark:  Not today.
Syrio Forel:  Go.
Arya Stark runs off and hears a bunch of screams from down the hallway. She looks concerned.
Arya Stark:  Not today. Not today.
Back on the other side of the Red Keep, Sansa runs on, but is stopped by a familiar face.
Sansa Stark:  Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father. I'll...I'll tell the Queen.
Sandor Clegane:  Who do you think sent me?
Back to Arya, we see that she has arrived at the slaughtered stewards. She sees her belongings lying on the ground.
Arya Stark:  Needle.
A stable boy appears.
Stable Boy:  There she is.
Arya Stark:  What do you want?
Stable Boy:  I want you, wolf girl. Come here.
Arya Stark:  Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
Stable Boy:  She'll reward me, the Queen!
Arya Stark:  Stay away!
Accidentally, she turns around sliding Needle through the stable boys belly. Her first kill is a fact.
Shook as she is, she runs off.
In the dark dungeon cells of Kings Landing we see Ned Stark. He sees a little light approaches him. After a short while it is clear that it's Varys, whom is holding a torch.
Lord Varys:  Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Ned Stark:  Varys.
Lord Varys:  I promise you it isn't poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch? Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
Ned Stark:  What about my daughters?
Lord Varys:  The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
Ned Stark:  And Sansa?
Lord Varys:  Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close. The rest of your household though, all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
Ned Stark:  You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
Lord Varys:  And would again, My Lord.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?
Ned Stark:  The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.
Lord Varys:  Ah, the children. It is always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the King.
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?
Ned Stark:  The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.
Lord Varys:  The wrong brother sadly.
And lost to her. Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
Ned Stark:  If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Lord Varys:  Not today, My Lord.
Varys is about to walk away, while being stopped by Ned one last time.
Ned Stark:  Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
Lord Varys:  The Realm, My Lord.
Someone must.
Varys leaves the dungeons.
At Castle Black a corpses are being carried inside. Some of the Night's brothers are inspecting the two bodies.
Jeor Mormont:  It's Othor, without a doubt.
Othell Yarwyck:  The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Jeor Mormont:  Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Jon Snow:  Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say.
Jeor Mormont:  Mmm.
Samwell Tarly:  The smell.
Othell Yarwyck:  What smell?
Samwell Tarly:  There is none.
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?
Jon Snow:  We should burn them.
Othell Yarwyck:  Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them. The Wildling way.
Jeor Mormont:  I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you're not stupid.
Get them inside.
Othell Yarwyck:  You heard him.
Ser Alliser: Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers. A raven from King's Landing.
Nights Watch brother:  Come on, move 'em out.
Jon Snow is summoned to Jeor Mormont's chambers. While entering the room, a conversation starts.
Jeor Mormont:  Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The King is dead.
Jon Snow:  Is there any word of my father?
Jeor Mormont:  Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
Jon points to the letter, as he wants to read it. Jeor Mormont hands it over. When reading the letter, Jon stands up and wants to walk away.
Jeor Mormont:  I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
Jon Snow:  My sisters were in King's Landing too.
Jeor Mormont:  I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Jon walks out.
Deep inside the Red Keep, Sansa is having a conversation with Cersei.
Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys and Littlefinger being in their presence.
Lord Varys:  Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
Sansa Stark:  He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't. Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.
Send for my father. He'll tell you, the King was his friend.
Cersei Lannister:  Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
Grand Maester Pycelle:  A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
Sansa Stark:  No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.
Petyr Baelish:  The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
Cersei Lannister:  Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest.
What's his name?
Sansa Stark:  Robb.
Cersei Lannister:  Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the King's peace.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
Sansa Stark:  If...if I could see my father, talk to him about...
Cersei Lannister:  You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father's treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
Sansa Stark:  I only meant that...what will happen to him?
Cersei Lannister:  That depends.
Sansa Stark:  On...on what?
Cersei Lannister:  On your brother. And on you.
Back at Winterfell, Robb reads the letter Sansa sent.
Robb Stark:  Treason? Sansa wrote this?
Maester Luwin:  It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.
Robb Stark:  Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
Maester Luwin: This is a royal command, My Lord.
If you should refuse to obey...
Robb Stark:  I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone. Call the banners.
Maester Luwin: All of them, My Lord?
Robb Stark:  They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
Maester Luwin: They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Maester Luwin: Yeah.
Maester Luwin walks off.
Theon Greyjoy:  Are you afraid?
Robb Stark:  I must be.
Theon Greyjoy:  Good.
Robb Stark:  Why is that good?
Theon Greyjoy:  It means you're not stupid.
At the Eyrie, Catelyn rushes to Lysa's chambers. Upon arrival she angrily speaks.
Catelyn Stark:  You've had this since dawn?
Lysa Arryn:  He sent it to me, not you.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
Catelyn Stark:  A courtesy?! My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
Lysa Arryn:  A war? Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him. Teach him patience.
Catelyn Stark:  Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience? He is your brother by law!Does family mean nothing to you?
Lysa Arryn:  Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.
Robin Arryn:  I'm hungry.
Lysa Arryn:  Hush now, darling. You just ate.
Catelyn Stark:  You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?
Robin Arryn:  But I'm hungry!
Lysa Arryn:  Soon, love, soon.
You're always welcome here, sister.
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight...
Catelyn Stark:  That is what I ask.
Lysa Arryn:  Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after.
Robin walks out of the room.
Catelyn Stark:  If you fear for the safety of your son...
Lysa Arryn:  Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot? They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
Catelyn Stark:  And that is why we have to stop them.
Lysa Arryn:  The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
Both Tyrion and Bronn are seen walking through the hills of the Vale.
Bronn:  Will you shut up? There's hill tribes all around here.
Tyrion Lannister:  If I'm going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
Bronn:  I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh? What would you do then?
Tyrion Lannister:  Starve, most likely.
Bronn:  You don't think I'd do it, do you?
Tyrion Lannister:  What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women? Golden women?
Stick with me and you'll have them all, for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.
Bronn:  Fair enough.
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.
Tyrion Lannister:  Though I would treasure your friendship.
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out.
Remember this: Whatever their price, I'll beat it.
I like living.
A while later, Tyrion and Bronn are seen near a campfire.
Bronn hears noises of approaching men and tries to warn Tyrion.
Bronn:  Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion.
Tyrion Lannister:  Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
Shagga:  When you meet your Gods, you tell them Shagga Son of Dolf of the Stone Crows sent you.
Tyrion Lannister:  I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?
Tyrion Lannister:  In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.
Take the half man.
He can dance for the children. Kill the other one.
Tyrion Lannister:  No no no no no! My, my House is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
Shagga:  We have no use for a half man's promises.
Tyrion Lannister:  Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do? Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal? Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don't fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
Shagga:  You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
Tyrion Lannister:  That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
Tyrion makes a gesture.
Shagga:  What is "this"?
Tyrion Lannister:  The Vale of Arryn.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.
In Castle Black's kitchen, Jon and Sam are preparing a meal, while Ser Alliser approaches.
Ser Alliser:  Now there's a rare sight. Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.
Jon looks Alliser in his eyes. Silence occur for a few seconds. Then, suddenly Jon tries to strike Alliser, but is stopped by Pypar and Grenn.
Samwell Tarly:  Jon, no! Jon, stop, put it down!
Ser Alliser:  Blood will always tell. You'll hang for this, bastard.
Ser Alliser had his fun and walks away, while Jeor Mormont saw the incident and walk towards Jon.
Jeor Mormont:  I told you not to do anything stupid. You're confined to quarters. Go.
Jon obeys and walks off.
Later that night, Ghost alerts Jon. He seems to be uneasy. Jon wakes up and talks to Ghost.
Jon Snow:  Ghost, what's wrong? Is something out there?
Jon decides to get out of bed, gear up and opens the door. Ghost runs off towards Jeor Mormants room.
Mounting his door.
Jon Snow:  Commander?
Jon Snow:  Stay.
Ghost waits at the front door, while Jon walks in.
Jon Snow:  Hello?
Who's there?
Lord Commander?
As soon as he walks through the door, the door shuts and the corpse of Othor attacks Jon. Jon tries to stab him with his dagger, but nothing seems to phase him. Jon pulls himself loose, draws his sword and cuts off Othor's other hand. Then Jon stabs Othor through the heart. Othor falls down. Suddenly Jeor Mormont arrives.
Jeor Mormont:  Snow!?
Jon Snow:  Commander!Othor gets back on his feet, pulling out Jon's sword out of his chest. Outside of the room, Ghost goes beserk, trying to get in.
Jon grabs Jeor's lantern and throws it at Othor. Othor catches fire.
Jon Snow:  Move move!
Jon grabs Jeor by his arm and flees inside a room, shutting the door.
The Khalasar have arrived the lands of Lhazar. Dany and her company walk through the burned area.
Daenarys Stormborn:  What did they do?
Rakharo:  Lamb men make good slaves. Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers.
And the slavers will give us gold...and silk and steel.
Daenarys Stormborn:  I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.
Jorah Mormont:  Gold to hire ships, Princess. Ships to sail to Westeros.
While walking a little further, Dany sees Dothraki men looting and holding Lhazareen captive.
Daenarys Stormborn:  Jorah, make them stop.
Jorah Mormont:  Khaleesi?
Daenarys Stormborn:  You heard me.
Jorah Mormont:  These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.
Rakharo:  She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue.
Jorah Mormont:  Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it's always been.
Daenarys Stormborn:  I do not have a gentle heart, Ser. Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
Jorah and Rhakharo both obey and run off, trying to stop the Khalasar, while freeing some Lhazareen.
Rhakharo:  Kash qoy qoyi thira disse. Me qorasokh anni!
While Rhakharo argues with a Dothraki man, Jorah brings over a Lhazareen woman.
Jorah Mormont:  Come.
Dothraki Man:  Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!
Jorah Mormont:  What do you want done with them?
Daenarys Stormborn:  Bring her to me. And those women there.
Jorah Mormont:  You cannot claim them all, Princess.
Daenarys Stormborn:  I can, and I will.
Leaving with a couple of Lhazareen women, Dany arrives at a covered courtyard, where Khal Drogo is having a discussion with Mago.
Mago:  Me Fati! Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni, ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!
Khal Drogo:  Me vastoe hatif anni; ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.
Khal Drogo:  Moon of my life. Mago says you have taken his spoils.
A daughter of a lamb men, who was his to mount. Tell me the truth of this.
Daenarys Stormborn:  Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars. I have claimed many daughters this day, so they cannot be mounted.
Khal Drogo:  This is the way of war. These women are slaves now to do with as we please.
Daenarys Stormborn:  It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wifes.
Qotho:  Does the horse mate with the lamb?
Daenarys Stormborn:  The dragons feeds on horse and lamb alike.
Mago:  You are a foreigner. You do not command me.
Daenarys Stormborn:  I am Khaleesi. I do command you.
Khal Drogo:  See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world. Filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
Mago spits on the ground and draws his sword.
Mago:  A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
When Qotho is trying to interfere, Khal Drogo calls him back.
Khal Drogo:  Ohosa. Os.
I will not have your body burned. I will not give you that honor.
Mago points out his sword and pushes it to Khal Drogo's chest.
Khal Drogo grins, it doesn't seem to phase him. He continues talking.
Khal Drogo:  The beetles will feed on your eyes. The worms will crawl through your lungs.
Mago starts swinging his sword, while Khal Drogo dodges his attack.
When turning his back on Mago, he grabs his daggers and speaks.
Khal Drogo:  The rain will fall on your rotting skin...
Khal Drogo turns around facing Mago and drops his daggers to the ground.
Khal Drogo:  Until nothing is left of you but bones!
Khal Drogo runs towards Mago, while dodging his attacks. While attacking, Mago screams.
mago:  First you have to kill me!
Khal drogo grabs Mago's sword, disarms him and cuts his throat open. He grabs Mago's throat, crushes it and pulls out his tongue.
He shows Mago's tongue to the crowd, walks back to his chair and throws Mago's tongue on a pile of rotting flesh.
While sitting down, Dany runs towards him.
Daenarys Stormborn:  My sun and stars is wounded.
Khal Drogo:  A scratch, moon of my life.
Daenarys Stormborn:  Where are the healers?
Khal Drogo:  This is the bite of a fly.
Mirri Maz Duur:  I can help the great rider with his cut.
Qotho:  The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
Daenarys Stormborn:  She is mine let her speak.
Mirri Maz Duur:  Thank you, silver lady.
Daenarys Stormborn:  Who are you?
When "the witch" is trying to approach Dany, Qotho stops her.
Mirri Maz Duur:  I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.
Qotho:  A witch.
And spits on the ground.
Mirri Maz Duur:  My mother was Godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his...
Qotho slaps "the witch" and says.
Qotho:  Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.
Mirri Maz Duur:  lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
Daenarys Stormborn:  Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars.
It makes me hurt to see you bleed.
Khal Drogo lays eyes upon "the witch". While he's seemingly in thought, "the witch" approaches him.
As Dany steps aside, she looks at Khal Drogo's wound.
Entering Winterfell, gathered Stark banner men are having a feast.
We see Greatjon Umber whom is having a conversation with Robb Stark.
Greatjon Umber:  For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men, boy.
I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard.
Robb Stark:  Galbart Glover will lead the Van.
Greatjon Umber:  The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home.
Robb Stark:  You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters, I will march back North, root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Greatjon Umber:  Oathbreaker, is it?!
Greatjon stands up as he is offended
Greatjon Umber:  I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
While Greatjon Umber raises his voice to Robb, Grey Wind rushes towards him and attacks, biting off 2 of his fingers.
Robb Stark:  My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Greatjon Umber:  Your meat...is bloody tough.
Greatjon Umber starts laughing breaking the tension, making everyone laughing along with him.
Later that night, Robb is having a short visit with Brann Stark. Upon entering his room, Brann is stil asleep.
Robb wakes him and a conversation follows.
Brann Stark:  What is it? What's happened?
Robb Stark:  Shh, it's all right.
Brann Stark:  Where are you going?
Robb Stark:  South. For father.
Brann Stark:  But it's the middle of the night.
Robb Stark:  The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don't want them to know we're coming.
Brann Stark:  They have more men than we do.
Robb Stark:  Aye, they do.
Brann Stark:  Can't I come with you? I can ride now. You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...
Robb Stark:  There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother.
Brann Stark:  I will.
Robb Stark:  I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.
Until I return.
Robb leaves the room, but as soon as Robb left, Rickon appears.
Brann Stark:  How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you, to say goodbye.
Rickon Stark:  They've all gone away.
Brann Stark:  They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.
Rickon Stark:  No, they won't.
Rickon turns arond and leaves the room.
The next morning, Brann is sitting affront of the Weirwood tree.
While saying his prayers, Osha approaches him.
Brann Stark:  Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
Osha:  You hear them, boy? The Old Gods are answering you.
Brann Stark:  What are you doing here?
Osha:  They're my Gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.
Brann Stark:  You're not a slave.
Osha points out to her chains and wiggles her foot.
Brann Stark:  Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I'm not complaining, Little Lord, just telling truths.
Brann Stark:  What did you mean about hearing the Gods?
Osha:  You asked them, they're answering you.
Shh. Open your ears.
Brann is trying to listen and looks up the Weirwood tree. He hears the wind blowing through the leaves.
Brann Stark:  It's only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods?
They see you, boy. They hear you.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.
The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Suddenly Hodor appears.
It appears he was bathing nearby, since he is bare naked holding a towel around his neck.
Osha:  Well, there's a big man.
He has giants blood in him or I'm the Queen.
Brann Stark:  Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
Go dress.
Hodor:  Hodor.
Hodor obeys and runs off.
Brann Stark:  Are there really giants beyond the Wall?
Osha:  Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he's marching the wrong way.All these swords, they should be going North, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
Looking back up to the Weirwood tree, Brann hears the wind again.
At castle Black, the Night's Watch decided to burn the corpse of Othor, whom attacked Jeor Mormant.
Sam decided to share some knowledge.
Samwell Tarly:  They were touched by White Walkers.
That's why they came back.
That's why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
Jon Snow:  How do you know that?
Samwell Tarly:  I read about it in a book. A very old book in Maester Aemon's library.
Jon Snow:  What else did the book say?
Samwell Tarly:  The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up...
Pypar:  And when they wake up, what?
Sam looks to the top of the Wall.
Samwell Tarly:  I hope The Wall is high enough.
Seemingly worried, the rest of the lot also look towards the top of the Wall.
Catelyn Stark and Ser Rodrik both arrive at Robb Starks camp.
Rodrik Cassel:  Summer snows, My Lady.
Catelyn Stark:  Robb's brought the North with him.
Entering Robbs tent, we see Robb and his banner men discussing tactics.
Robb Stark:  The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.
Greatjon Umber:  One army or two, the Kings in the North threw back hosts ten times this large.
Robb Stark:  Mother!
Catelyn Stark:  You look well.
Greatjon Umber:  Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.
Theon Greyjoy:  We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.
Catelyn Stark:  I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone. I know you will forgive me, My Lords.
Greatjon Umber:  You heard her! Move your asses! Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf? Have no fear, My Lady.
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
You old devil, Rodrik.
Rodrik Cassel:  Jon.
Greatjon Umber:  You're not wasting away, are you?
As soon as the men left, Catelyn hugs Robb.
Catelyn Stark:  I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
Robb Stark:  There was no one else.
Catelyn Stark:  No one? Who were those men I saw here?
Robb Stark:  None of them are Starks.
Catelyn Stark:  All of them are seasoned in battle.
Robb Stark:  If you think you can send me back to Winterfell...
Catelyn Stark:  Oh, would that I could.
Robb Stark:  There was a letter. From Sansa.
Catelyn Stark:  From the Queen, you mean.
There's no mention of Arya.
Robb Stark:  No.
Catelyn Stark:  How many men do you have?
Robb Stark:  18,000. If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey...
Catelyn Stark:  you would never be allowed to leave. No.
Our best hope, our only hope, is that you can defeat them in the field.
Robb Stark:  And if I lose?
Catelyn Stark:  Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children, when the Mad King fell?
Robb Stark:  They were butchered in their sleep.
Catelyn Stark:  On the orders of Tywin Lannister. And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Robb Stark:  Well, that makes it simple then.
Catelyn Stark:  I suppose it does.
----------------------------------------------------
Arriving at the foot of the Lannister camp, Tyrion, Bronn, Shagga and the hill tribe, decide to stop for a short while.
A conversation follows.
Tyrion Lannister:  From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Shagga:  Best for Tyrion son of Tywin. Not best for me.
If the half man betrays us, Shagga son of Dolf will cut off his manhood...
Tyrion Lannister:  And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right then. Time to meet my father.
Moving into the Lannister camp, Shagga and the hill tribe follow.
Upon entering the Tywin Lannister's tent, we see Kevan Lannister and Tywin sitting at a table, scheming.
Kevan Lannister  Tyrion.
Tyrion Lannister:  Uncle. Father.
Tywin Lannister:  The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Tyrion Lannister:  Sorry to disappoint you.
Tywin Lannister:  And who are these Companions of yours?
Tywin Lannister:  This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn son of...
Bronn:  You wouldn't know him.
Tyrion Lannister:  May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister.
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West. Kind of you to go to war for me.
Tywin Lannister:  You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
Tyrion Lannister:  We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's braver. I'm better looking.
Jamie Lannister:  He's been covering himself in glory.
Kevan Lannister:  Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
Tyrion Lannister:  And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
Tywin Lannister:  Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
Tyrion Lannister:  How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Tywin Lannister:  Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.
Tyrion Lannister:  My sister rules, you mean.
Kevan Lannister:  Stark's son has called his banners.
He moves south with a strong host.
Tywin Lannister:  A green boy.
One taste of battle and he'll run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.
Tyrion Lannister:  Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You'd like him.
While we're on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces...
Suddenly a messenger appears, interrupting Tyrion's request.
Messenger:  If it please My Lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.
Tywin Lannister:  The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it. Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
Kevan Lannister:  At once, My Lord.
Tywin Lannister:  It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Shagga:  Only if the half man fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion's life is ours.
Tywin looks over to Tyrion. Tyrion looks shooked.
Back at Robbs camp, inside his tent we see Robb and his men plotting.
Rodrik Cassal:  The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his Knights at a disadvantage.
Greatjon Umber:  No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the River Lords will join us.
Robb Stark:  To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
Theon Greyjoy:  Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.
Catelyn Stark:  "The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.
Meanwhile, outside a few Stark men captured a scout, leading him to Robbs tent.
Theon Greyjoy:  Robb's right.
We need that bridge.
Greatjon Umber:  So what's it gonna be? Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Stark guard:  Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.
Theon covers the map with pawns
Greatjon Umber:  Don't worry, lad.
He won't be leaving this tent with his head.
Robb Stark:  Where did you find him?
Stark guard:  In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
Robb walks towards the Lannister scout.
Robb Stark:  How high did you get?
Lannister scout:  20,000. Maybe more.
Rodrik Cassel  You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand.
Robb Stark:  My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honor and courage.
Let him go.
Catelyn Stark:  Robb.
Robb looks over his shoulder with a stare. Catelyn understands and looks down in regret.
Robb Stark:  Tell Lord Tywin, Winter is coming for him.
To find out if he really does shit gold.
Lannister scout:  Yes, My Lord. Thank you, My Lord.
Greatjon Umber:  Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?
Robb Stark:  You call me boy again.
Greatjon Umber wants to taunt Robb.
Robb Stark:  Go on.
Greatjon Umber:  Oi.
Frustrated, Greatjon Umber walks out of the tent.
In Kings Landing, we see Ned Stark asleep in the dungeons, a guard on patrol kicks his feet waking him up. Then walks on.
Meanwhile, in the Throne room, new roles are being announced by Grand Maester Pycelle.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  It is also the wish of His Grace, that his loyal servant Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch...
While Grand Maester Pycelle is speaking, Sansa walks by a few familiar faces.
Sansa Stark:  Ser Aron.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  Be at once raised to the rank of Lord.
Sansa Stark:  Lord Gyles.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him, until the end of time.
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Cersei Lannister:  Ser Barristan Selmy.
Barristan Selmy approaches.
Barristan Selmy:  Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Cersei Lannister:  Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
Barristan Selmy:  Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life. Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Cersei Lannister:  Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?
King Joffrey:  You let my father die.
You're too old to protect anybody.
Barristan Selmy:  Your Grace...
Cersei Lannister:  The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
Barristan Selmy:  The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
Cersei Lannister:  Careful, Ser.
Lord Varys:  We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
Barristan Selmy:  A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a Knight. I shall die a Knight.
Petyr Baelish:  A naked Knight, apparently.
Barristan Selmy:  Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy! Melt it down and add it to the others.
King's Landing Page:  If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Sansa Stark:  Your Grace.
King Joffrey:  Come forward, My Lady.
Sansa walk forth.
King's Landing Page:  The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Cersei Lannister:  Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
Sansa Stark:  I do.
Sansa kneels down.
Sansa Stark:  As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  Treason is a noxious weed.
It should be torn out, root...
King Joffrey:  Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Sansa Stark:  Thank you, Your Grace.
Petyr Baelish:  Do you deny your father's crime?
Sansa Stark:  No, My Lords. I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy. I know My Lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.
They must have lied to him. Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
King Joffrey:  He said I wasn't the King. Why did he say that?
Sansa Stark:  He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn't himself. Otherwise h never would have said it.
Lord Varys:  A child's faith Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  Treason is treason!
King Joffrey:  Anything else?
Sansa Stark:  If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
King Joffrey:  Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I'm the King or there'll be no mercy for him.
Sansa Stark:  He will.
At the King’s Landing catacombs, Varys goes out to see Ned Stark.
Varys:  You've seen better days, my lord.
Eddard Stark:  Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.
Varys:  No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.
Eddard Stark:  On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
Varys:  You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want.
Eddard Stark:  l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.
Eddard Stark:  Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
Varys:  l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero.
Eddard Stark:  What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?
Varys:  Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
Eddard Stark:  Robb? He's just a boy.
Varys:  Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
Eddard Stark:  Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
Varys:  Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
Eddard Stark:  You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?
Varys:  l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.
Eddard Stark:  You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
Varys:  Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?
Theon shoots a raven coming from The Twins. Robb picks it up and reads the message.
Robb Stark:  lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
Theon Greyjoy:  Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
Catelyn Stark:  Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
Robb Stark:  He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
Greatjon Umber:  Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
Robb Stark:  Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
Theon Greyjoy:  Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
Greatjon Umber:  Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
Catelyn Stark:  The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.
Robb Stark:  Have my horse saddled and ready.
Greatjon Umber:  Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
Theon Greyjoy:  Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
Robb Stark:  My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.
Catelyn Stark:  l agree. l'll go.
Everyone:  You can't!
Catelyn Stark:  l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
Greatjon Umber:  Unless there was a profit in it.
Catelyn finds herself inside the Twins, which the Freys gathered to watch her audience with Lord Walder.
Walder Frey:  What do you want?
Catelyn Stark:  lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord.
Walder Frey:  Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?
Stevron Frey:  Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –
Walder Frey:  Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?
Ryger Rivers:  Father, please –
Walder Frey:  l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.
(gestures to Catelyn) All right, you come forward.
(kisses her hand) There. Now that l've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.
Catelyn Stark:  ls there somewhere we can talk?
Walder Frey:  We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
(taps his new wife on the bottom) Oh! You too.
(To Catelyn) You see that? Fifteen, she is. A little flower. And her honey's all mine.
Catelyn Stark:  l'm sure she will give you many sons.
Walder Frey:  Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
Catelyn Stark:  He is quite ill, my lord.
Walder Frey:  Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me.
Catelyn Stark:  My lord, l –
Walder Frey:  Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
Catelyn Stark:  l'm sure there were reasons –
Walder Frey:  l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
Catelyn Stark:  To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.
Walder Frey:  Why should l let him?
Catelyn Stark:  lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.
Walder Frey:  There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.
Catelyn Stark:  You swore an oath to my father.
Walder Frey:  Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.
Catelyn Stark:  Why don't you?
Walder Frey:  Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?
--------------------------------
At Castle Black, Jon Snow and Commander Mormont are having a chat.
Voices outside:  And engage!
Jeor Mormont:  When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
Jon Snow:  Soon, he says.
Jeor Mormont:  Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.
Jon Snow:  This is Valyrian steel.
Jeor Mormont:  lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.
Jon Snow:  My lord, you honor me, but l can't –
Jeor Mormont:  Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?
Jon Snow:  Yes, my lord.
Jeor Mormont:  Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it.
Jon Snow:  l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
Jeor Mormont:  No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.
Jon Snow:  Yes, my lord.
Jon Snow leaves the room and emerges outside, heading towards the mess hall.
Unidentified Night’s Watchers:  Well done. Well done.
Night’s Watcher #1:  You earned that, Snow.
Night’s Watcher #2:  Well done.
Jon arrives at the mess hall. The other men gather around him to see his new sword, but Sam remains seated at a distance, looking distraught.
Pyp:  Go on, let's have a look.
Jon Snow:  At what?
Grenn:  The sword! Show us the sword.
All:  Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
Pyp:  Let's have a look.
Grenn:  Piss off.
Pyp:  Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!
Grenn:  Look at its eyes.
While the others are playing with the sword, Jon gets seated beside Sam.
Jon Snow:  What is it?
Jon Snow:  You can't what?
Samwell Tarly:  l'm really not supposed to say.
Jon Snow:  And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
Samwell Tarly:  There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
Jon Snow:  What? What about him?
Samwell Tarly:  He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe.
Jon Snow:  l should be there. l should be with him.
--------------------------
Back at the Crossing, Catelyn returns from her conversation with Walder Frey at the Twins, and finds Robb and the others having a meeting in his tent.
Greatjon Umber:  lf we do that, they'll never get back across.
Robb Stark:  Well? What did he say?
Catelyn Stark:  Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well.
Robb Stark:  Huh.
Catelyn Stark:  Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
Robb Stark:  What does he want in return?
Catelyn Stark:  You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
Robb Stark:   Fine, fine. And?
Catelyn Stark:  And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
Robb Stark:  She won't be happy about that. And?
Catelyn Stark:  And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
Robb Stark:  l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
Catelyn Stark:  l did.
Robb Stark:  And?
Catelyn Stark:  One was – Do you consent?
Robb Stark:  Can l refuse?
Catelyn Stark:  Not if you want to cross.
Robb Stark:  Then l consent.
Robb leaves the meeting right away. Theon laughs while Catelyn watches.
We cut to a shot of Robb’s men on the other side of the river, having already crossed the Green Fork of the Trident and heading south.
--------------
Back at Castle Black. Jon goes to see Maester Aemon, finding him cutting meat to serve to the ravens.
Jon Snow:  Sam said you wanted to see me?
Maester Aemon:  l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?
Jon Snow:  No.
Maester Aemon:  So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
Jon Snow:  He would do whatever was right, no matter what.
Maester Aemon:  Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?
Jon Snow:  Sam told you.
Maester Aemon:  We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose.
Jon Snow:  And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
Maester Aemon:  Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know.
Jon Snow:  You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.
Maester Aemon:  The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South: the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless, blind, frail. But when l heard they had killed my brother's son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children.
Jon Snow:  Who are you?
Maester Aemon:  My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King.
Jon Snow:  You're Aemon Targaryen.
Maester Aemon:  l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have.
------------------------------
Across the Narrow Sea, the Dothraki are on the move. Drogo leads them, but seems to have fainted. Daenerys rides right behind him.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.
Drogo falls off his horse.
Khal Drogo:  (in Dothraki) My horse…
Cohollo:  (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood…
Khal Drogo:  (in Dothraki) No, l must ride.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) You do not command me, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Hyah! Hyah!
---------------------
At the Lannister camp, Tywin is presiding over lunch/war meeting. Tyrion gets there while everyone’s already seated and eating.
Kevan Lannister:  Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
Tywin Lannister:  The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.
Tyrion Lannister:  Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.
Tywin Lannister:  l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.
Kevan Lannister:  The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided.
Tyrion Lannister:  Shagga likes axes.
Tywin Lannister:  When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.
Tyrion Lannister:  The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
Kevan Lannister:  They do seem rather ferocious.
Tyrion Lannister:  Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.
Tywin Lannister:  When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.
Tyrion Lannister:  Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
Tywin Lannister:  There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
Tyrion Lannister:  lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords.
Back at his tent, Tyrion finds Bronn there with a woman (a prostitute) waiting there too.
Tyrion Lannister:  Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
Bronn:  l took her.
Tyrion Lannister:  Took her? From whom?
Bronn:  From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
Tyrion Lannister:  And he didn't have anything to say about it?
Bronn:  He said something.
Tyrion Lannister:  Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.
Bronn:  Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one.
Bronn leaves. Tyrion addresses the prostitute.
Tyrion Lannister:  Who are you?
Prostitute:  Who would you like me to be?
Tyrion Lannister:  What did your mother call you?
Prostitute:  Shae. What did your mother call you?
Tyrion Lannister:  My mother died giving birth to me.
Shae:  ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
Tyrion Lannister:  What sort of accent is that?
Shae:  Foreign.
Tyrion Lannister:  For-
Shae:  What do you want from me?
Tyrion Lannister:  What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.
Shae:  And what do l get?
Shae:  Who told you this? Women you paid?
Shae gets undressed and kisses Tyrion.
Shae:  Let's start with your last night in this world.
------------------------------
Back across the Narrow Sea. Drogo is mumbling incoherently in Dothraki (no subtitles provided) inside a tent, Daenerys by his side.
Jorah Mormont: Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
Jorah removes an herbal treatment from Drogo’s wound, revealing it has become infected.
Jorah Mormont:  He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
Jorah Mormont:  Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l won't leave him.
Jorah Mormont:  He's already gone, Khaleesi.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo.
Jorah Mormont:  This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l won't leave him.
Mirri Maz Duur enters the tent, and bows to Daenerys. Qotho comes to check on Drogo too, with a few other bloodriders at the entrance.
Mirri Maz Duur:  The wound has festered.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) You did this, witch. (pulls a dagger out of its sheath)
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.
Jorah Mormont:  (in Dothraki) Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.
Qotho and the other Dothraki leave.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.
Jorah Mormont:  l think you're right.
Jorah leaves the tent.
Mirri Maz Duur:  You've saved me once more.
Daenerys Targaryen:  And now you must save him.
Mirri Maz Duur:  He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
Mirri Maz Duur:  There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Do it. Save him.
Mirri Maz Duur:  There is a price.
Daenerys Targaryen:   You'll have gold, whatever you want.
Mirri Maz Duur:  lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
Daenerys Targaryen:  My death?
Mirri Maz Duur:  No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse.
Daenerys signals to Irri, who leaves to find the horse. We cut to the horse being taken by a rope into to the tent.
Rakharo:  Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch.
Daenerys Targaryen:   Kill her and you kill your khal.
Rakharo:  This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
Mirri Maz Duur starts an incantation
Mirri Maz Duur:  Go. Now.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Take her and leave. Take her!
Mirri Maz Duur:  You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight.
Daenerys caresses Drogo’s forehand as she moves to leave.
Daenerys Targaryen:  No one will enter.
Mirri Maz Duur slits the horse’s throat. Blood spills all over Drogo’s chest and Daenerys’ face.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Bring him back to me.
Daenerys leaves the tent as the horse collapses to the ground, dead. Jorah comes to her.
What have you done?
Daenerys Targaryen:  l have to save him.
We could have been 10 miles away from here by now, on the way to Asshai. You would have been safe.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) This must not be.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) This must be.
Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Witch.
Rakharo:  (in Dothraki) Nothing good will come of this.
Rakharo tries to talk to Qotho, but gets sucker punched in the face.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) No, you can't.
Qotho unsheaths his dagger and moves past Daenerys, pushing her towards the ground. Daenerys hits the ground with her belly.
Irri:  Khaleesi!
Jorah Mormont:  (in Dothraki) No further, horselord.
Daenerys starts moaning in pain, while we hear Mirri Maz Duur’s incantations in the background. Qotho turns around and lunges towards Jorah. The two fight, but Jorah gains the upper hand and kills him with a sword blow to the face.
Jorah Mormont:  Are you hurt?
Daenerys Targaryen: The baby –
Jorah Mormont:  Hmm?
Daenerys Targaryen: … is coming.
Jorah Mormont:  Fetch the midwives.
Rakharo:  They will not come. They say she is cursed.
Jorah Mormont:  They'll come or l'll have their heads.
Jorah moves inside the tent with Daenerys in his arms, as screams and incantations from the inside start getting louder and louder in tone.
-----------------------
At the Lannister camp, Tyrion, Bronn and Shae are drinking together inside Tyrion’s tent at night, before the battle.
Shae:  Are you in agony, my lion?
Tyrion Lannister:  No.
Shae:  You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
Tyrion Lannister:  Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?
Shae:  Just used to it.
Bronn:   Drink.
Tyrion Lannister:  Let's play a new game.
Bronn:  There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
Tyrion Lannister:  Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
Bronn:  Not if you win.
Tyrion Lannister:  No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at.
Shae:  What are you good at?
Tyrion Lannister:  l happen to be a great judge of character.
Bronn:  This sounds like a boring game.
Shae:  l don't want to play this game.
Tyrion Lannister:  Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
Bronn drinks.
Bronn:  But my mother hit harder.
Tyrion Lannister:  You killed your first man before you were 12.
Bronn:  lt was a woman. (Tyrion drinks. Shae looks at Bronn, surprised.) She swung an axe at me.
Tyrion Lannister:  You've been north of the Wall.
Shae:  What brought you up there?
Bronn:  Work.
Tyrion Lannister:  And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. (Tyrion drinks) Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.
Shae:  l don't want to play.
Tyrion Lannister:  lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
Shae:  Drink.
Tyrion drinks.
Tyrion Lannister:  All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.
Shae:  Drink.
Tyrion Lannister:  And we've established the rules about lying?
Shae:  Drink!
Tyrion drinks.
Tyrion Lannister:  You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
Bronn:  The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
Tyrion Lannister:  So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?
Shae:  Drink.
Tyrion Lannister:  Are you sure –
Shae:  Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head.
Tyrion Lannister:  My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.
Shae:  My turn.
Tyrion Lannister:  Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.
Shae:  Who were you in love with?
Tyrion Lannister:  That's not how the game works.
Shae:  l don't care the way the game works.
Bronn:  Our lord here used to be married.
Shae:  Married?
Tyrion Lannister:  How did you hear that?
Bronn:  You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
Tyrion Lannister:  Another night, perhaps.
Shae:  Not another night. This night.
Tyrion Lannister:  lt's not a pleasant story.
Shae:  Oh, maybe l will cry.
Bronn:  l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
Tyrion Lannister:  So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.
Bronn:  For three chickens, l should hope so.
Bronn:  Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.
Bronn:  l would have killed the man who did that to me.
Shae:  You should have known she was a whore.
Tyrion Lannister:  Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.
Shae:  A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
Tyrion Lannister:  As l said, l was young and stupid.
Shae:  You are still young and stupid.
Shae starts kissing Tyrion, causing Bronn to leave the tent. The next day, the Lannisters ride to battle; Bronn returns to Tyrion’s tent to wake him and Shae up.
Tyrion Lannister:  What is it? What do you want?
Bronn:  You're sleeping through the war.
Tyrion Lannister:  What?
Bronn:  They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
Tyrion Lannister:  Get my squire!
Bronn:  You don't have a squire.
Tyrion Lannister:  lf l die, weep for me.
Shae:  You'll be dead. How will you know?
Tyrion Lannister:  l'll know.
Tyrion leaves the tent, fully armoured.
Lannister soldier : Watch out! Move!
Lannister soldier : Out of the way! Move aside!
Bronn:  Stay low.
Tyrion Lannister:  Stay low?
Bronn:  lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.
Tyrion Lannister:  l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!
Tribesmen of the Vale (chanting): Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!
Tyrion Lannister:  To battle!
Tyrion rides to battle with the rest, but turns around quickly after and is hit with a mace from one of the Tribesmen. He passes out. Later, we cut to the end of the battle – dead bodies and swords piling on the ground. Tyrion wakes up to find Bronn talking to him as he’s carried on a wheelbarrow.
Bronn:  You're a shit warrior.
Tyrion Lannister:  l'm alive?
Bronn:  You're alive.
Tyrion Lannister:  Did we win?
Bronn:  We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
Tyrion Lannister:  How did our tribesmen do?
Bronn:  Yeah, good.
Tyrion Lannister:  lt's nice to see them getting along.
Tywin shows up next to them, fully armoured and on horseback.
Tywin Lannister:  You're wounded.
Tyrion Lannister:  Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
Tywin Lannister:  Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand].
Tyrion Lannister:  Did we get the Stark boy, at least?
Tywin Lannister:  He wasn't here.
Tyrion Lannister:  Where was he?
Tywin Lannister:  With his other 18,000 men.
Tyrion Lannister:  And where are they?
--------------
We cut to Catelyn and Rodrik Cassel overlooking the Trident from a safe distance at higher ground.
Rodrik Cassel:  We should go, my lady.
Catelyn Stark:  No!
Rodrik Cassel:  My lady!
Stark bannermen:  Hyah! Hyah!
The Stark host arrives at the clearing. Robb is amongst them, and he comes carrying a tied and bound Jaime Lannister.
Robb Stark:  By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.
Jaime Lannister:  Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it.
Catelyn Stark:  lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
Jaime Lannister:  l've lost them too, l'm afraid.
Theon Greyjoy:  Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
Robb Stark:  He's more use to us alive than dead.
Catelyn Stark:  Take him away and put him in irons.
Robb Stark:  lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.
Greatjon Umber:  Come on, pretty man.
Robb Stark:  l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
Theon Greyjoy:  The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
Robb Stark:  Aye. But the dead won't hear them. (making a speech to his bannermen) One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
-----------------------
At King’s Landing, Arya is chasing down pigeons on the street while staying hidden from the Kingsguard. She catches one and snaps its neck. Soon afterwards, she sees a baker’s stall with pastries on display.
Arya Stark:  Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
King’s Landing Baker:  Three coppers.
Arya Stark:  How about a nice fat pigeon?
King’s Landing Baker:  Oh, piss off now. Go on.
Arya Stark:  Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
King’s Landing Baker:  Piss off!
Everyone starts walking up the street, leaving Arya confused. Two street urchins run past her up the stairs.
Arya Stark:  Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?
Street Urchin:  They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
Arya Stark:  Who?
Street Urchin:  The Hand of the King.
Arya follows the crowd to the Sept of Baelor. She climbs up the pedestal of Baelor’s statue to get a better view of her surroundings. We cut to Ned Stark being taken from the sept and into the courtyard, in full view of the gathered populace; Baelor’s statue is seen on the background to his left. Ned catches Arya’s eye at the foot of the statue.
Populace:  Traitor! Coward!
Ned is taken across the populace and runs into Yoren of the Night’s Watch.
Eddark Stark:  Baelor!
Yoren looks towards the statue knowingly.
Populace:  Traitor! Traitor!
Ned is taken to a raised platform where Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey, Littlefinger are standing. Sansa smiles warmly at her father as he addresses the crowd.
Eddark Stark:  I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the grace of all the Gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?
Joffrey Baratheon:  My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!
The townsfolk roar with approval; Arya leaves the pedestal and runs towards the commotion. Sansa gets visibly distraught and starts yelling as a member of the Kingsguard holds her back.
Sansa Stark:  No, stop! Please, someone stop him!
Cersei Baratheon: My son, this is madness.
Populace: Put him down!
Varys runs to the platform to talk to Cersei and Joffrey, Ilyn Payne puts on his executioner’s mask. Arya marches towards the courtyard but is grabbed by the arm by Yoren.
Yoren: Don't look!
Arya Stark:  Let me go.
Yoren:  Shut your mouth. Look at me.
Sansa Stark:  Stop him, stop!
From Ned’s perspective, the roars of the crowd become almost silent; he looks towards Baelor’s statue but finds no one there. He lowers his head in recognition of his fate as the sound of Payne’s longsword cuts through the hushed silence. We see the sword swing until it reaches his head, with a direct cut to Arya as Yoren prevents her from seeing the actual execution. Arya looks at the sky; a flock of pigeons flies away from the courtyard as she holds her head against Yoren’s chest; she sighs heavily, and the screen cuts to black.
We begin where “Baelor” left off; after the execution of Ned Stark, we see Ilyn Payne’s bloodied sword and the Hound picking up Ned’s head to show it to the rapturous townsfolk. We then pan to Arya, her eyes closed and her face pressed against Yoren’s chest.
Yoren:  Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.
Yoren takes Arya with him away from the mob and into a flight of stairs; on the courtyard, Sansa faints.
Yoren:  Keep your mouth shut, boy. (takes out a knife)
Arya Stark:  l'm not a boy!
Yoren:  You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! (starts cutting Arya’s hair as the screams and shouts from the crowd are heard above) North, boy, we're going north.

At Winterfell, Bran has a dream in which he can walk and sees a three-eyed raven. He then talks about this dream with Osha.
Bran Stark:  lt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there.
Osha:  Your father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet.
Bran Stark:  You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
Osha:  l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.
Bran Stark:  You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.
Osha takes Bran to the crypts. She carries him with her arms while he lights the way with a torch.
Bran Stark:  That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father.
Osha:  You see? He's not here.
A loud roar is heard and a shadow moves in front of them. A direwolf runs towards them; Osha falls to the ground with him. We see Shaggydog barking at them viciously.
Rickon Stark:  Here, Shaggydog.
Bran Stark:  Rickon!
Osha:  That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!
Rickon Stark:  He doesn't like chains.
Bran Stark:  What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.
Rickon Stark:  No, l came to see Father.
Bran Stark:  How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.
Rickon Stark:  He was down here. l saw him.
Bran Stark:  Saw him when?
Rickon Stark:  Last night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog.
Rickon leaves with Shaggydog, while Osha looks puzzled at Bran. We cut to a shot of her carrying him outside.
Osha:  You both miss him. lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that –
Maester Luwin:  Bran…
--------------------------------------
Catelyn Stark walks alone through the Stark camp. Several bannermen bow to her respectfully as she passes.
Several Stark Bannermen:  My lady. My lady. My lady.
She reaches a small forest outside camp and collapses in grief by one of the trees, crying and sobbing. She hears some screams and the sound of a sword slashing wood nearby. As she gets closer, she realizes it’s Robb, fully armoured, slashing his sword against a tree while crying.
Catelyn Stark:  Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword.
Robb drops his sword to the ground and goes to Catelyn. She hugs him and caresses his neck, trying to console him.
Catelyn Stark:  Shh! Shh! Shh!
Robb Stark:  l'll kill them all. Every one of them. l will kill them all.
Catelyn Stark:  My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.
-------------------------------------
At the Throne Room on the Red Keep, Marillion the bard is singing a song for Joffrey and his retinue. Cercei stands by his side, while Sansa overlooks the scene from one of the colonnades.
Marillion:  (singing)
The boar's great tusks, they boded ill
For good King Robert's health
And the beast was every bit as fat
As Robert was himself
But our brave king cried,
"Do your worst!
l'll have your ugly head!
You're nowhere near as murd'rous as
the lion in my bed"
King Robert lost his battle and
He failed his final test,
The lion ripped his balls off,
And the boar did all the rest.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Very amusing. lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.
Marillion:  l'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear.
Marillion:  Your Grace?
Sansa looks at Joffrey, despondent.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat.
Marillion:  Every man needs hands, Your Grace.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Good. Tongue it is.
Marillion:  Your Grace, please. l won't sing, Your Grace.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?
Marillion:  l beg you! Please, no. No!
Ilyn Payne marches towards the fire to heat up his dagger.
Marillion:  Your Grace, please. l beg you, l will never sing again! (screaming) No!
Joffrey Baratheon:  l'm done for the day. l'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.
Marillion:  (screaming) Your Grace, please!
As Joffrey leaves with Meryn Trant and the Hound, he passes by Sansa. Marillion is still screaming and begging in the background.
Joffrey Baratheon:  You look quite nice.
Sansa Stark:  Thank you, my lord.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Your Grace. l'm King now.
Marillion:  (screaming) Stop! No!
Joffrey Baratheon:  Walk with me. l want to show you something.
Sandor Clegane:  Do as you're bid, child.
Joffrey and Sansa are outside, walking past across a row of spears in the Red Keep. Trant and Clegane follow behind them.
Joffrey Baratheon:  And as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long.
The pikes have impaled heads on them. Sansa looks away.
Sansa Stark:  No! Please, no!
Joffrey Baratheon:  (pointing at one of the heads) This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
Sansa Stark:  You promised to be merciful.
Joffrey Baratheon:  l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.
Sansa Stark:  Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear –
Joffrey Baratheon:  Mother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here, and obey. Look at him!
Sansa looks up at the head of her father.
Joffrey Baratheon:  Well?
Sansa Stark:  How long do l have to look?
Joffrey Baratheon:  As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?
Sansa Stark:  lf it please Your Grace.
Joffrey Baratheon:  That's your Septa there. (shot of the impaled head of a woman with the traditional Septa headscarf) l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well.
Sansa Stark:  Or maybe he'll give me yours. (looks defiantly at Joffrey, who cowers)
Joffrey Baratheon:  My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady. Ser Meryn.Ser Meryn strikes Sansa repeatedly with the back of his (armoured) hand, leaving her lip bloodied. Sansa notices the stone bridge Joffrey is on leads to a street some feet below. She moves forward to lunge him from the edge, but she’s stopped by the Hound.
Sandor Clegane:  Here, girl. (cleans her bloody lip with a rag)
Joffrey Baratheon:  Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.
Sandor Clegane:  Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants.
Sansa tries to give him is handkerchief back.
Sandor Clegane:  You'll be needing that again.
Sandor leaves, leaving Sansa alone at the bridge. She looks at the heads atop the pikes and cries.
--------------------------------------------------------
War meeting at the Stark camp. They sit at the table at night by torchlight.
Robb Stark:  Renly is not the king.
Jonos Bracken:  You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death.
Robb Stark:  That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis.
Jonos Bracken:  Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
Galbart Glover:  Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…
Rickard Karstark:  l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. (bows to Robb and extends him his sword) The King in the North!
Theon Greyjoy:  Am l your brother, now and always?
Robb Stark:  Now and always.
Theon Greyjoy:  (takes out his sword, bows to Robb) My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.
Greatjon Umber:  The King in the North!
All:  (chanting)  The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
They all take out their swords and swear fealty to Robb as Catelyn looks wearily at the whole scene.
All:  (chanting)  The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
Catelyn goes to the outskirts of their camp, to the dungeons where prisoners are being kept.
Stark Guard:  Lady Stark.
Catelyn Stark:  l want to see him. Now! Leave us.
They walk for a while until they reach a single prisoner (Jaime), kept away far from the rest.
Catelyn Stark:  Leave us. (the guards leave)
Jaime Lannister:  You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. (Catelyn grabs a large rock from the ground)  Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. (She marches towards him and hits the rock against his forehead)   Oh, l do like a violent woman.
Catelyn Stark:  l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.
Jaime Lannister:  Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long.
Catelyn Stark:  That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.
Jaime Lannister:  But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?
Catelyn Stark:  Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.
Jaime Lannister:  What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
Catelyn Stark:  Because of men like you.
Jaime Lannister:  There are no men like me. Only me.
Catelyn Stark:  My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?
Jaime Lannister:  l pushed him out the window.
Catelyn Stark:  Why?
Jaime Lannister:  I hoped the fall would kill him.
Catelyn Stark:  Why?
Jaime Lannister:  You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war. (Catelyn drops the rock and goes away)
-----------------------------------------
Cersei and Lancel are having one of their rendezvous on her bedchamber. Cersei is reading a message while Lancel speaks, naked.
Lancel Lannister:  l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?
Cersei Lannister:  Stop talking. Get back into bed.
-----------------------------------------
Back in the Riverlands, we sit with the Lannister war meeting. Tywin, Tyrion and Kevan are in assistance.
Tywin Lannister:  They have my son.
Tyrion Lannister:  The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
Leo Lefford:  l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
Addam Marbrand:  ls it true about Stannis and Renly?
Kevan Lannister:  Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace.
Tyrion Lannister:  There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
Kevan Lannister:  l'm told we still have his sisters.
Leo Lefford:  The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
Addam Marbrand: Kevan Lannister:  First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise –
Tywin Lannister:  (shouting)  They have my son! Get out, all of you. (to Tyrion) Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong. 
Tyrion Lannister:  Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.
Tywin Lannister:  No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
Tyrion Lannister:  And do what?
Tywin Lannister:  Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…
Tyrion Lannister:  Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?
Tywin Lannister:  You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?
-------------------------------------------
Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is sleeping inside a yurt. Jorah is sitting beside her when she wakes up.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Ser Jorah?
Jorah Mormont:  Gently, gently.
Daenerys Targaryen:  My son – where is he? l want him. Where is he?
Jorah Mormont:  The boy did not live.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Tell me.
Jorah Mormont:  What is there to tell?
Daenerys Targaryen:  How did my son die?
Jorah Mormont:  He never lived, my princess. The women say –
Daenerys Targaryen:  What do the women say?
Jorah Mormont:  They say the child was –
Mirri Maz Duur:  (entering the tent) Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.
Mirri Maz Duur:  As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him.
Jorah Mormont:  Time enough for that later –
Daenerys Targaryen:  l want to see him now.
They leave the tent/yurt, following Mirri Maz Duur to the place where Drogo is lying.
Daenerys Targaryen:  The khalasar is gone.
Jorah Mormont:  A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Drogo! (in Dothraki) My sun and stars. (in the Common Tongue, to the rest) Why is he out here alone?
Jorah Mormont:  He seems to like the warmth, Princess.
Mirri Maz Duur:  He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (looking at Drogo’s catatonic expression) This is not life. When will he be as he was?
Mirri Maz Duur:  When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Leave us.
Jorah Mormont:  l don't want you alone with this sorceress.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
Daenerys and Mirri Maz Duur have a conversation alone.
Daenerys Targaryen:  You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
Mirri Maz Duur:  lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.
Daenerys Targaryen:  This is not God's work. My child was innocent.
Mirri Maz Duur:  lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l spoke for you. l saved you.
Mirri Maz Duur:  Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my god's house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?
Daenerys Targaryen:  Your life.
Mirri Maz Duur:  Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.
------------------------------
At Castle Black, Jon is preparing to leave in the night and desert the Night’s Watch; Sam is there to try to talk him out of it.
Samwell Tarly:  You can't!
Jon Snow:  Get out of my way, Sam.
Samwell Tarly:  They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?
Jon Snow:  Better than you do.
Samwell Tarly:  What are you going to do?
Jon Snow:  l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat. (gets on horseback)
Samwell Tarly:  You can't leave us now. We need you here.
Jon Snow:  Move.
Samwell Tarly:  l won't let you go.
Jon Snow:  Move.
Samwell Tarly:  No.
Jon Snow:  Hyah!
Jon rides his horse away from Castle Black, his horse kicking Sam to the ground as he was standing in the way. Ghost follows him out.
---------------------------------
In the Lannister camp in the Riverlands, Tyrion and Shae are talking inside his tent about his recent appointment.
Shae:  Hand of the King?
Tyrion Lannister:  So it would seem.
Shae:  And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?
Tyrion Lannister:  No, he said l couldn't take  you with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point.
Shae:  He knew my name?
Tyrion Lannister:  What?
Shae:  He said, "Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?
Tyrion Lannister:  l believe he used the word "whore".
Shae:  Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?
Tyrion laughs.
Shae:  I’m funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore.
Tyrion Lannister:  My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand – (Shae kisses Tyrion)
Shae:  l know what a Hand needs.
------------------------------------
Jon and Ghost are being chased by his fellow Night’s Watch brothers through a forest not long after he left.
Jon Snow:  Ghost?
Sam, Pyp, and Grenn:  Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
During the chase, Sam hits his head on a tree branch and falls off his horse. The others and later Jon stop to assist him.
Grenn:  Samwell!
Pyp:  ls he dead?
Grenn:  No, he's not dead.
Samwell Tarly:  Did we get him?
Grenn:  Come on, help me get him up.
Pyp:  Lucky you've got plenty of padding. (to Jon)  We're taking you back to where you belong.
Jon Snow:  l belong with my brother.
Samwell Tarly:   But we're your brothers now.
Grenn:  They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
Jon Snow:  They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
Pyp:  Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.
Grenn:  But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.
Jon Snow:  l have to.
Grenn:  You can't. You said the words.
Jon Snow:  I don't care about –
Samwell Tarly:  "Hear my words and bear witness to my vow"
Jon Snow:  To hell with all of you.
Pyp:  "Night gathers and now my watch begins. lt shall not end until my death. l shall live and die at my post.
Grenn:  "l am the sword in the darkness – "
Sam, Pyp, and Grenn:  (in unison, reciting the vow) "l am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.”
Sam brings Longclaw to Jon, who accepts it.
------------------------------------------
Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is tending to Drogo and his wounds inside a yurt.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars.
We cut to Daenerys standing with her head pressing against Drogo’s chest, now visibly more distressed.
Daenerys Targaryen:  (crying)  When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.
Daenerys kisses Drogo, then uses a pillow to smother him.
------------------------------------------
In King’s Landing, Pycelle is having a conversation with someone (unseen at first) in his bedchambers.
Ros gets dressed while Pycelle keeps talking.
Grand Maester Pycelle:   He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness.
Ros is listening, but seems really bored by the whole thing.
Ros:  So what's the thing?
Grand Maester Pycelle:  What thing?
Ros:  About kings. You said, "The thing you need to understand about kings".
Grand Maester Pycelle:  What? Things? What?
Ros:  When you started, you… Never mind.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  Let me see you out, my dear.
Ros:  lt's all right. No need.
Grand Maester Pycelle:  Yes, yes. Till the next time. (Pycelle gets off the bed and stretches his limbs with ease, belying his old age and general sickly demeanor) Right.
He gets dressed in his robes and looks at himself in the mirror with pride. Before he leaves his chambers, he moves from an upright position to the hunchback he’s always seen with in public. He’s faking it.
In the Throne Room, Littlefinger and Varys have a chat overlooking the Iron Throne.
Varys:  When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?
Petyr Baelish:  lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
Varys:  A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.
Petyr Baelish:  And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?
Varys:  l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
Petyr Baelish:  You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
Varys:  Oh, you can do better than that.
Petyr Baelish:  When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered.
Varys:  Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
Petyr Baelish:  l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
Varys:  l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.
Petyr Baelish:  Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all.
Varys:  Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
Petyr Baelish:  But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
Varys:  And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women.
Petyr Baelish:  A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.
Varys:  So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
Petyr Baelish:  Playing our roles.
Varys:  (Joffrey arrives, Varys bows)  Serving a new King.
Petyr Baelish:  Long may he reign. My king. (bows)
Varys:  My king.
Joffrey Baratheon:  My lords. Shall we begin?
Elsewhere in King’s Landing, Yoren is taking Arya to safety, away from the city.
Yoren:  You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, ‘cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?
Arya Stark:  Arry.
Yoren:  You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time –  men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot – half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.
Arya bumps into a fat recruit, Hot Pie.
Hot Pie:  Watch yourself, midget.
Lommy Greenhands:  He's got a sword, this one.
Hot Pie:  What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
Lommy Greenhands:  Maybe he's a little squire.
Hot Pie:  He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.
Lommy Greenhands:  Let's have a look. (wrestles Arya to the ground)
Hot Pie:  l could use me a sword like that.
Lommy Greenhands:  Take it off him.
Hot Pie:  Give it here, midget.
Lommy Greenhands:  Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.
Hot Pie:  l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!
Arya Stark:  (pointing Needle at Hot Pie) You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.
Hot Pie bumps into Gendry, Robert’s bastard.
Gendry:  Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? (Hot Pie leaves, scared. Gendry talks to Arya alone) This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?
Arya Stark:  lt was a gift.
Gendry:  lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers.
Arya Stark:  Which are you?
Gendry:  Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am.
Yoren:  (shouting) Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall, and winter is coming!
The caravan of the Night’s Watch leaves the walls of King’s Landing.

Back at Castle Black, Jon is serving Commander Mormont his breakfast.
Jeor Mormont:  Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?
(Jon looks at the Lord Commander with surprise) Don't look so terrified. lf we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town. Honor made you leave, honor brought you back.
Jon Snow:  My friends brought me back.
Jeor Mormont:  l didn't say it was your honor.
Jon Snow:  They killed my father.
Jeor Mormont:  And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?
Jon Snow:  No.
Jeor Mormont:  When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?
Jon Snow:  No.
Jeor Mormont:  Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
Jon Snow:  Beyond the Wall?
Jeor Mormont:  l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?
The Men of the Night’s Watch gather their forces at leave to range Beyond the Wall. Lord Commander Mormont leads them, with Jon amongst his brothers.

Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is leading a ceremony for Drogo after his death.
Rakharo:  (picking up the dragon eggs from their chest, speaking in Dothraki) ls this your command, Khaleesi? (Daenerys nods, Rakharo places the eggs next to Drogo’s funeral pyre)
Jorah Mormont:  Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
Daenerys Targaryen:  They were not given to me to sell.
Jorah Mormont:  Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not.
Daenerys Targaryen:  l must. You don't understand.
Jorah Mormont:  Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.
Daenerys Targaryen:  ls that what you fear? (kisses Jorah on the cheek, then speaks to the rest of the Dothraki and Lhazareen who stayed with her)  You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.
Mirri Maz Duur is shown tied and bound by rope.
Daenerys Targaryen:  Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me.
(to the crowd)  l am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen of the blood of old Valyria. I am the Dragon’s daughter. And I swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming.
Mirri Maz Duur:  You will not hear me scream.
Daenerys Targaryen:  I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.
Daenerys walks towards the pyre and lights it on fire with a torch. Mirri Maz Duur starts uttering some incantations which quickly turn into screaming. Daenerys walks into the burning pyre as her dress catches fire. The flames engulf everything, and the screen fades to black.
We then cut to the next day in the morning. Jorah goes to the pyre to see if there’s anything left of it. Amidst the smoke, a naked Daenerys appears, covered in soot and carrying three baby dragons in her arms and back.
Jorah Mormont:  (bowing)  Blood of my blood.
Everyone else bows to her as her dragons start screeching. We cut to black over a final screech from one her dragons.
