INT. KING'S LANDING
The camera pans up to the hold of a sword hewn from Valeryan steel. Tywin draws it and hands it to a blacksmith, who knocks its hilt off with a hammer, and then places the blade into the forge. It melts into molten sludge and is then recast into two swords. Tywin throws the carcass of a wolf into the fire.
INT. Jaime holds up a sword, admiring it.
JAIME: Magnificent.
TYWIN:  Mm-hmm.
JAIME: Looks fresh-forged.
TYWIN: It is.
JAIME: No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
TYWIN: There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
JAIME: Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
TYWIN: From someone who no longer had need of it.
JAIME nods and hefts the blade.
JAIME: You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
TYWIN: And now we have two.
JAIME: Two?
TYWIN: The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
JAIME: Well, thank you. It's glorious.
JAIME attempts to sheath the sword into the cover lying on the table, but fails awkwardly. TYWIN starts as the sheath bobbles.
TYWIN: You'll have to train your left hand.
JAIME: Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
TYWIN: You'll never be as good.
JAIME: No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter.
TYWIN: You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
JAIME: Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
TYWIN:  The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
JAIME: How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
TYWIN:  Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
JAIME: Home?
TYWIN: You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
JAIME:You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
TYWIN:  I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
JAIME: You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
TYWIN:  You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
JAIME: No.
TYWIN:  No?
JAIME: No.
TYWIN: I don't believe I asked you a question.
JAIME: There's my answer.
TYWIN:  If you think your bloody honor comes before...
JAIME: My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children.
TYWIN:  What do you want?
JAIME: Supper would be nice.
TYWIN: For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve.
JAIME: I suppose you want the sword back.
TYWIN:  Keep it.
JAIME grabs the sword.
TYWIN: A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
JAIME picks up the sword and exits
EXT. Outside King's Landing
TYRION, PODRICK and BRONN stand on a road leading to King's Landing. BRONN holds a sigil with both stag and lion. Commoners dot the road in their daily routine. A peasant leads two reluctant, bleating goats past them.
BRONN: How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
TYRION: Please don't.
BRONN: Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside.
TYRION: This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends.
BRONN: If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?
TYRION: There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
BRONN: And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?
TYRION: No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
BRONN: Oh.
Hoofbeats approach.
TYRION: Ah, here we are.
TYRION claps.
TYRION: Can you read the sigils?
BRONN: Yellow balls?
PODRICK: Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.
TYRION: Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
BRONN: I need a sigil.
TYRION:  And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?
PODRICK: I don't see it, my lord.
TYRION nods and steps foward to greet th first Dornish lords that approach on horsebak.
TYRION: Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company.
DORNISH LORD: The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.
TYRION: (Nods.) Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.
DORNISH LORD: Will he?
TYRION: And where is Prince Oberyn?
DORNISH LORD: Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince.
TYRION: Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.
The Dornish lords advance rudely, before TYRION can finish his welcome.
TYRION: You must be weary after such a long journey.
TYRION, BRONN and PODRICK must step aside to make way. PODRICK struggles with his sigil. They begin walking back to the city.
BRONN: Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?
TYRION:  We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
BRONN: How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
TYRION: You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?
BRONN: I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old.
CUT TO: INTERIOR, brothel
OBERYN walks behind a row of prostitutes, taking their measure. He comes around to face them, walking past OLYVAR. ELLARIA lounges behind him, as he decides upon WHORE #1.
OBERYN: Look at this one. How lovely is she?
ELLARIA: Beautiful. But pale.
OBERYN: They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.
OBERYN removes her tunic.  Do I frighten you?
WHORE #1: (Shakes her head no, looking down. )
OBERYN: You like?
ELLARIA: Timid. Timid bores me.
OBERYN moves to WHORE #2, the next in line. She has been meeting the gaze of the Dornish visitors.
OBERYN: You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?
WHORE #1, scuttles shyly to dress herself.
OBERYN: I think she likes you. ELLARIA" She has good taste.
OBERYN: You're not timid, are you?
WHORE #2 saunters forward, smirking, and acrobatically balances on her left foot while pulling her right foot behind her to touch her head.
ELLARIA: (Laughs) Not timid.
OBERYN:  Do you like women?
WHORE #2: When they look like her, my lord.
ELLARIA: This one will do nicely.
OLYVAR: Very good, my lady.
ELLARIA: Oh, I'm not a lady.
OLYVAR: A term of courtesy in this establishment.
ELLARIA: A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.
OLYVAR: Any of the others?
OBERYN:  The two girls can leave.
OLYVAR snaps his fingers and turns to leave.
OBERYN:  You stay.
OLYVAR: I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord.
OBERYN:  Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.
OLYVAR:  My lord.
OBERYN:  I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?
OLYVAR: Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.
OBERYN:  Take off your clothes.
OBERYN, opens OLYVAR"s tunic and caresses him. Meanwhile ELLARIA and WHORE #2 are kissing and fondling one another.
OLYVAR: Which way do you like it?
OBERYN roughly grabs OLYVAR's cock.
OLYVAR: (Gasps)
OBERYN: My way  .
MORGAN: And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere.  And now the rains
OBERYN is perturbed by the singing.
ELLARIA: Oberyn.
MORGAN:  Weep o'er his hall...
OBERYN moves towards the source of the singing.
ELLARIA:  Oberyn, don't.
ELLARIA gets up and hands her wine to WHORE #2 and follows OBERYN, concerned.
CUT TO: A nearby room in the brothel.
MORGAN and MORGAN'S FRIEND sit entangled with their prostitutes. One of them is singing.
MORGAN:   With no one there to hear Yes, not the rains  weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear.
OBERYN enters.
MORGAN'S FRIEND: You lost, friend?
OBERYN: Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.
MORGAN'S FRIEND: I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.
OBERYN: We don't like the smell. (Laughs)
ELLARIA grabs OBERYN to persuade him to leave. OLYVAR enters behind them.
ELLARIA: Come with me, lover.
MORGAN: Gods, look at this one.
OLYVAR: Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room.
MORGAN: Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil. (Laughs)
OBERYN: Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
OBERYN walks towards the men. MORGAN and MORGAN"S FRIEND rise to his challenge, and their whores flee the room.
OBERYN: You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
MORGAN grabs towards his weapon on the table, but OBERYN is faster. He pierces MORGAN's hand with his dagger, and traps it against the table.
MORGAN: (Screams)
MORGAN'S FRIEND grabs the hilt of his blade and begins to draw.
OBERYN: Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist.
OBERYN twists the blade
MORGAN: (Groans)
OBERYN: He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions.
MORGAN'S FRIEND ponders while MORGAN groans and OBERYN smiles devilishly.
TYRION and BRONN enter swiftly.
TYRION: Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be...
MORGAN'S FRIEND pops his sword back and OBERYN flicks his dagger free from the table, and MORGAN's hand. MORGAN lets out a cry of anguish and then he and his friend move away quickly.
TYRION: trouble.
ELLARIA moves to OBERYN, and caresses him.
OBERYN: Apologies, my love.
MORGAN'S FRIEND helps MORGAN though the door to exit. OBERYN and ELLARIA kiss passionately. TYRION and BRONN exchange a puzzled look.
TYRION: I'm here to welcome you to the capital.
Reluctantly, OBERYN and ELLARIA release their embrace.
OBERYN: Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.
TYRION: If there's anything I can do to make your stay...
OBERYN: What are you? His hired killer?
BRONN: It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.
OBERYN: How did that come to pass?
BRONN: Killed the right people, I suppose.
OBERYN laughs. BRONN joins him.
OBERYN: We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?
Comically, BRONN nods while TYRION shakes his head.  OBERYN. You don't partake?
TYRION: Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.
ELLARIA continues to kiss OBERYN.
TYRION: Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?
ELLARIA releases her embrace and OBERYN signals for her to go.
EXT. Outside of the brothel.
The door opens and TYRION and OBERYN emerge.
OBERYN: Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
TYRION: Oh, they take all kinds.
OBERYN: Even Dornishmen.
TYRION: The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
OBERYN: Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.
TYRION: Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult.
OBERYN: (Chuckles)
TYRION: Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?
OBERYN: I was invited to the royal wedding.
TYRION: I thought we were speaking truth.
OBERYN: The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city...
TYRION: I wasn't actually present.
OBERYN: And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?
TYRION's gaze is cast downward, so OBERYN takes his chin and meets his eyes.
OBERYN: I'm asking you a question.
TYRION: I've heard rumors.
OBERYN: (Chuckles) So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
TYRION: I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
OBERYN: If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.
OBERYN exits and TYRION looks concerned.
EXT. ESSOS
DAENERYS sits with DROGON nuzzling her, while VISERION and RHAEGAL fly in the distance. DAENERYS chuckles and strokes DROGON, soothing him. JORAH walks up. VISERION and RHAEGAL tussle in midair over a carcass, which lands before the rock where DAENERYS sits. The two dragons follow, fighting to claim the meat. DROGON rises to his haunches, and roars. The other dragons submit and DROGON moves to take the carcass. JORAH comes closer.
JORAH: They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother.
CUT TO: ESSOS EXTERIOR
The unsullied stand at the ready. DAENERYS and JORAH approach, followed by three Dothraki. They walk up tot join BARRISTAN SELMY and MISSANDEI in front of the troops.
DAENERYS: Ser Barristan.
BARRISTAN: Your Grace.
DAENERYS: Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?
BARRISTAN: Gambling, Your Grace.
DAENERYS: Gambling?
Annoyed, DAENERYS strides forward. MISSANDEI follows briskly. They walk between rows and rows of unsullied.
CUT TO: ESSOS village exterior.
The crowd bows in reverence as DAENERYS and MISSANDEI stride past.
CROWD: Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...
DAENERYS: How long have they been at it?
MISSANDEI: Since midnight, Your Grace.
They come upon DAARIO NAHARIS and GREY WORM, who sit cross legged facing one another. Each of them holds their arms extended straight before them,  their weapons resting atop. Apparently, this is a game of endurance.
DAARIO: Ser Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake.
DAENERYS: What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?
DAARIO: The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.
DENERYS: That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
DAENERYS turns to leave, but neither of the men budge.
DAENERYS: The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.
DAARIO and GREY WORM drop their arms simultaneously. Their weapons fall to the sand. DAARIO groans, while MISSANDEI gives GREY WORM a look. DARIO nods to GREY WORM and they both stand.
DAARIO: (in valerian) You like this girl? Must be frustrating.
GREY WORM: (in valerian) You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis.
DAARIO: (in valerian) I'd rather have no brains and two balls.
DAARIO leaves, and GREY WORM watches, stretching his aching shoulders.
EXT. King's Landing.
MAREI stands in the background while. SHAE fills a plate from a garden banquet table, and places it before SANSA, who sits motionless.
SHAE: You need to eat something.
SANSA does not respond.
SHAE: Pigeon pie.
SANSA: No, thank you.
SHAE looks back to the table for other options, and picks up SANSA's plate.
SHAE: Lemon cakes?
SANSA: No, thank you.
SHAE: You love lemon cakes.
TYRION enters.
SHAE: Tell her she needs to eat.
TYRION: My lady, you do need to eat.
SANSA: I don't need to eat.
TYRION: If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
MAREI leaves, but SHAE stays. TYRION nodes, imploringly.
SHAE: She needs to eat.
SHAE exits and TYRION sits at the table with SANSA. He takes her hand.
TYRION: I can't let you starve.
SHAE looks back in anger.
TYRION: I swore to protect you.
SANSA looks away and removes her hand from Tyrion's.
TYRION: My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you.
SANSA: How can you help me?
TYRION: I don't know, but I can try.
SANSA: I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.
TYRION: I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
SANSA: Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
TYRION: What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true.
SANSA stands, and TYRION does as well, in politeness.
SANSA: Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood.
TYRION: Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.
SANSA: I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.
SANSA exits and TYRION watches her go.
INT. TYRION's chambers.
Tyrion enters, and shuts the door. Shae lies in his bed.
SHAE: My lion.
TYRION: What are you doing?
SHAE: What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.
TYRION: How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
SHAE: I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?
TYRION: Of course I haven't forgotten.
SHAE: I want you. Don't you want me?
TYRION:  Things are a bit tense right now.
SHAE: What things?
TYRION: My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
SHAE: You need to relax.
SHAE takes TYRION's fingers into her mouth to moisten them, then places his hand under her dress.
SHAE: Don't you want to relax?
SHAE tries to kiss him, but TYRION removes his hand in defiance.
SHAE:  What's wrong?
TYRION: I told you. It's not a good time.
SHAE:  It's never a good time. You have your child bride now.
TYRION:  Shae.
SHAE: Do you love her?
TYRION:  Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
SHAE:  That's not an answer.
TYRION: Of course I don't love her.
SHAE: You tried to ship me away.
TYRION: Ship you away?
SHAE: Give me diamonds and make me disappear.
TYRION:  What in the world are you talking about?
SHAE: If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!
TYRION:  Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.
SHAE: You want me to stay?
TYRION does not respond. SHAE picks up her shoe and leaves in anger. MAREI is eavesdropping behind a column.
INT. King's Landing.
QYBURN places a sleeve over the stump of JAIME's wrist. He then grabs a golden hand and pushes it onto Jaime's stump, twisting it into place. JAIME groans and grimaces.
JAIME: (Groans)
QYBURN: A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent.
CERSEI pours wine in the foreground.
JAIME: You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it.
JAIME: Days?
CERSEI: Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?
JAIME moves his metal hand around for effect.
JAIME: Uh... a hook would be more practical.
CERSEI: Elegant, I think.
QYBURN squeeze the hand firmly into place, and JAIME winces. QYBURN starts to depart but CERSEI intercepts him.
CERSIE: Thank you for your help with the other matter.
QYBURN: The symptoms have abated?
CERSEI: Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.
QYBURN: Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can.
QYBURN turns to JAIME, who waves his fake hand meekly. QYBURN gives CERSEI one last look, and exits.
JAIME: Odd little man.
CERSEI:  I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?
JAIME: What symptoms?
CERSEI: Symptoms that are not your concern.
JAIME: You let him touch you?
CERSEI: You jealous?
JAIME: I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
CERSEI: (Laughs) You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
JAIME: I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
CERSEI: Well, they smell like Pycelle.
JAIME: You drink more than you used to.
CERSEI: Yes.
JAIME: Why?
CERSEI: Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.
JAIME: It must have been traumatic for you.
CERSEI: My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
JAIME: A rather short siege.
CERSEI: A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So...
JAIME sits beside her.
JAIME: Father disowned me today.
CERSEI: He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
JAIME: You're forgetting Tyrion.
CERSEI: You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?
JAIME takes her hand.
JAIME: Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
He moves to kiss her.
CERSEI: Not now.
JAIME:  I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
CERSEI does not answer.
JAIME: Something's changed.
CERSEI: Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
JAIME: What do you want me to apologize for?
CERSEI: For leaving me.
JAIME: You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
CERSEI: Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
JAIME: Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you.
CERSEI: You took too long.
JAIME:  I... What are you saying?
CERSEI:  I'm saying you took too long.
There is a knocking at the door.
CERSEI: Come in.
JAIME: Go away.
MAREI enters.
MAREI: Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important.
EXT. North of the wall.
YGRITTE sits fletching arrows. TORMUND approaches.
TORMUND: You plan on killing all the crows yourself?
YGRITTE: Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?
TORMUND: We wait for Mance's orders.
YGRITTE: You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.
TORMUND: And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there.
YGRITTE: Yeah, well, he's a liar.
TORMUND: He is? Shouldn't it be "he was"? You said you put three arrows in him.
YGRITTE:  I did.
TORMUND: I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go.
A wildling whistles from above. TORMUND and YGRITTE turn to look, and rise.
CUT TO: The crevice
YGRITTE and TORMUND lead a group of wildlings with weapons draw. Other wildings stand above the crevice where they advance.  Some Thenns approach, led by the menacing STYR.
TORMUND: Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns.
TORMUND sheathes his sword. The Thenns come closer.
TORMUND: Mance sent you?
STYR:  (Grunts)
The Thenn party continues to walk through
TORMUND: How did you find us?
STYR nods back at a THENN WARG, who releases a bird for reconnaisance.
TORMUND: You came from the south, not the north.
WARG: Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.
A Thenn drops a heavy bag from his shoulder to the floor of the crevice.
STYR: Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
TORMUND: Help yourself.
STYR: (Chuckles) Maybe everything's just better fed down here.
The Thenns pull some bird meat off the spit that was on the fire.
STYR: Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?
STYR pats TORMUND on the shoulder as he walks past. TORMUND follows, with YGRITTE further behind.
STYR: You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?
TORMUND: I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.
STYR: She yours?
YGRITTE: I'm not anybody's.
YGRITTE notches an arrow and places it directly on  STYR's throat. Two of his Thenn companions draw their swords.  STYR stares YGRITTE down.
STYR: Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.
STYR turns his attention to TORMUND. YGRITTE lowers her bow a TORMUND's command. The other Thenns continue to work at the fire.
STYR: Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.
STYR walks towards the fire.
STYR: I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow.
STYR kneels before the fire, where the other Thenns have skewered a human arm on the spit roasting in the fire.
EXT. Winterfell. Some Knight's Watch recruits are practicing their archery.
OFFICER: Draw. Loose.
SAM walks by the recruits as they fire their arrows at a row of straw men, to varying effect. He then walks up the steps to JON's quarters.
CUT TO: Jon's quarters
Jon is dressing in pain. SAM stands behind him.
JON: Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. "He said, " Next time I see you, you'll be all in black." I was jealous of Robb my whole life. (Winces) The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could.
SAM: Sometimes I want to hate you.
JON turns in surprise.
SAM: Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading.
JON: (Chuckles)
SAM: They're... they're ready for you.
JON picks up his leather armor and walks towards the door.
JON: He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
SAM: No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.
JON: I've done plenty wrong.
INT. Winterfell.
ALLISER THORNE questions JON SNOW. He is flanked by JANOS SLYNT and MAESTRE AEMON
ALLISER THORNE: So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?
JON: I didn't murder him.
ALLISER THORNE:  No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?
JON: He wanted me to kill him.
JANOS SLYNT: A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?
JON: The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
ALLISER THORNE: Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.
JON: Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...
JANOS SLYNT: The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.
JON: Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl.
JANOS SLYNT: You admit to breaking your vows, then?
JON: I do.
JANOS SLYNT: The law is the law. The boy must die.
MAESTER AEMON: If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men.
ALLISER THORNE: There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
JON: While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.
ALLISER THORNE:  Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.
JON: 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him.
JANOS SLYNT: (Laughs) Giants?
JON: Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?
JANOS SLUNT: I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.
JON: And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
JANOS SLYNT stands in indignation.
JANOS SLYNT: How dare you?!
JON: There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
JANOS SLYNT sits back down.
JON: Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
MAESTER AEMON: None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on.
JON nods and leaves. MAESTER AEMON stands to leave, frail and helped by his assistant. He moves slowly down the wooden stairs from the dais to the floor.
ALLISER THORNE: I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.
MAESTER AEMON: Yes, you are.
ALLISER THORNE:  And I don't trust the bastard.
MAESTER AEMON: He told the truth.
ALLISER THORNE: And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?
MAESTER AEMON: I grew up in King's Landing.
EXT. King's Landing garden.
OLENNA and MARGAERY consider necklace options for her wedding.
OLENNA: No. No. You're a queen, not an ox.
OLENNA picks up one of the necklaces, sentimentally. MARGAERY smiles.
OLENNA: Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
OLENNA tosses the necklace away, surprising MARGAERY.
MARGAERY: The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything.
OLENNA: Nonsense.
OLENNA turns to the half dozen maids waiting.
OLENNA: My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best.
The maids exit, laughing. OLENNA turns back to MARGAERY. They sit.
OLENNA: The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.
MARGAERY: Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
OLENNA: You watch that. Even here, even with me.
Footsteps approach and BRIENNE enters.
OLENNA: My word.
BRIENNE: My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.
OLENNA: We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.
BRIENNE looks embarrassed.
OLENNA: I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
BRIENNE: My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment.
OLENNA turns to MARGAERY, intrigued.
OLENNA: You dare not refuse.
CUT TO: Another part of the garden.
BRIENNE and MARGAERY stroll next to a pond
MARGAERY: A shadow?
BRIENNE: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king.
MARGAERY: Joffrey is our king now.
BRIENNE: I meant no offense.
MARGAERY: And you've given none.
MARGAERY gently touches BRIENNE on the shoulder.
INT. King's Landing.
JOFFREY, JAIME and MERYN TRANT are strategizing.
JAIME: All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?
JOFFREY: Yes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on.
JAIME: Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
MERYN: I've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence.
JAIME: And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble.
MERYN: The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.
JAIME: Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.
JOFFREY: By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.
JAIME: The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
JOFFREY: I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle.
JAIME: My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy.
JOFFREY: Busy getting captured.
JOFFREY thumbs through a large tome.
JAIME: So this is the famous "Book of Brothers"? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. (Chuckles) Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. (Laughs) Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man.
JAIME: So they say.
JOFFREY: Ser Jaime Lannister. (Chuckles)
There is very little written in the Book of Brothers about JAIME.
JOFFREY: Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
JAIME:  There's still time.
JOFFREY:  Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?
JAIME: I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest.
JOFFREY and MERYN exit. JAIME walks over to the book, and slams it shut.
EXT. ESSOS
The unsullied are marching past DAENERYS and MISSANDEI, who stand on a cliff overlooking the shore.
DAENERYS: Have you ever been to Meereen?
MISSANDEI: Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys.
DAENERYS: And?
MISSANDEI: They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.
DAENERYS: And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?
MISSANDEI:  If they're smart, Your Grace.
Footsteps approach, and DAARIO NAHARIS enters.
DAENERYS: You were told to ride at the back of the train.
DAARIO: Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy.
DAENERYS signals for MISSANDEI to leave them.
MISSANDEI: Your Grace.
MISSANDEI exists.
DAENERYS: All right, what is this matter of strategy?
DAARIO presents DAENERYS with a purple flower.
DAARIO: A dusk rose.
DAENERYS: Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
DAENERYS starts to walk away, but DAARIO follows and presents her with another small flowering plant, this one is white.
DAARIO: And this one's called lady's lace.
DAENERYS: Would you like to walk without shoes?
DAAERIO: You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy.
DAARIO presents her with a red flower.
DAARIO: Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.
DAARIO presents the three flowers to DAENERYS in a small bouquet.
DAENERYS: You are a gambler, aren't you?
She takes the flowers. DAARIO makes a small bow to depart.
DAARIO: Your Grace.
DAENERYS ponders. A man shouts in valerian. She joins, BARRISTAN SELMY, JORAH, GREY WORM and MISSANDEI. They have found a mile marker, festooned by a woman's corpse who points the way to Mereen.s
JORAH: There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
DAENERYS: How many miles are there between here and Meereen?
BARRISTAN: 163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this.
DAENERYS: You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.
EXT.  KING'S LANDING.
SANSA stands on the shore with eyes closed. BRIENNE and JAIME stand on the cliff above.
BRIENNE: There she is.
JAIME: Yes, there she is.
BRIENNE: And? You made a promise.
JAIME: To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
BRIENNE: To keep them safe.
JAIME: Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication.
BRIENNE: A complication does not release you from a vow.
JAIME: What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
BRIENNE: Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
JAIME: Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks.
JAIME exits. BRIENNE follows.
SANSA comes up from the shore. She hears something, and realizes that she is not alone. She quickens her pace through the woods. A man trails her, stealthily. She speeds her walk, and comes to a table. TOMMY taps her on the shoulder. She starts.
SER DONTOS:  It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
SANSA:  You're drunk.
SER DONTOS: Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?
SANSA: Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
SER DONTOS: I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.
SANSA: Anyone would have done the same.
SER DONTOS: But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life.
SER DONTOS gives SANSA a necklace with blue stones. SANSA looks closely at it.
SER DONTOS: It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.
SANSA: I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.
SER DONTOS: I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
SANSA: I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.
SER DONTOS: Yeah.
They both smile
EXT. THE RIVERLANDS
ARYA sits in front of the HOUND on his horse. They ride through a scene of brutal violence, with villagers slaughtered amongst their upended carts. Flies buzz at the corpses.
ARYA: When am I going to get a horse of my own?
HOUND: The little lady wants a pony.
ARYA: The little lady wants away from your stench.
HOUND: Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?
ARYA: Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
HOUND: No.
ARYA: You're not very smart, are you?
HOUND: I'm not a thief.
ARYA: You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?
HOUND: A man's got to have a code.
ARYA: You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
HOUND: You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much.
CUT TO: outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings.
ARYA: I'm hungry. You're hungry.
HOUND: Five horses, five men. More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach.
Two men exit the bulding, and ARYA recognizes POLLIVER.
ARYA: I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
The two men urinate into the bushes by the farm.
ARYA: He killed Lommy.
HOUND: What the fuck's a Lommy?
ARYA: He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.
HOUND: Got what?
ARYA: My sword Needle.
HOUND:  Needle? Of course you named your sword.
ARYA: Lots of people name their swords.
HOUND: Lots of cunts.
The two men finish relieving themselves and return inside. The HOUND notices that ARYA has started towards the Inn.
HOUND: What are you... get back here.
ARYA: My brother gave me that sword.
HOUND:  Get back here.
ARYA:  He killed my friend.
The HOUND grabs ARYA roughly by the should and puts himself between her and the door.
HOUND: I don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there.
The door opens behind him and a soldier meets his eye. The HOUND turns to face him fully. He retreats, allowing the HOUND to enter.
CUT TO: FARMHOUSE INTERIOR
The HOUND enters the door, and a woman can be heard whimpering while the soldiers egg each other on.
MAN: Come on, give it up.
INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER: (Whimpers)
MAN: Come here.
INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER: (Whimpers)
MAN: Let's have a feel there.
MAN #2: Leave it.
The INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER struggles in the grasp of one of the men ARYA enters behind the hound and shuts the door. The soldiers look warily at their the duo. Everyone goes quiet as the HOUND and ARYA enter the inn. The HOUND and ARYA sit at a table in the back. The men return to their assault on the girl.
MAN: Come here.
INNKEEPER: Please, she's a good girl.
POLLIVER: Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.
POLLIVER turns to look at ARYA . He recognizes her.
POLLIVER: I know you.
ARYA graps the hilt of the HOUND's sword. POLLIVER stnads.
POLLIVER: You're the Hound.
ARYA is relieved. She releases her grip on the HOUND's sword. POLLIVER walks over and joins their table.
POLLIVER: Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?
HOUND: I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?
POLLIVER: Just keeping the king's peace.
HOUND: No need. The war's over.
The INNKEEPER pours them some ale. The HOUND drinks.
POLLIVER: So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.
HOUND: None taken.
POLLIVER: He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun? (Chuckles)
POLLIVER turns to look at ARYA.
POLLIVER: But I don't need to tell you that, eh?
HOUND: She's all right. I've had better.
POLLIVER: (Laughs) You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been.
HOUND: I'm not going to King's Landing.
POLLIVER: Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.
HOUND: Fuck the king.
The chatter in the inn stops.The HOUND takes a drink.
POLLIVER: When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But here you are.
HOUND: Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens.
POLLIVER: You got money to pay for it?
HOUND: You paid for it?
POLLIVER: (Laughs) No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?
HOUND: Not a penny.
HOUND: I'll still take that chicken.
POLLIVER: Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
The men chuckle.
HOUND: You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.
The HOUND takes POLLIVER's ale, and finishes it in one long drink.
HOUND: Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.
POLLIVER: You don't seem to understand the situation.
HOUND: I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.
POLLIVER: You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?
HOUND: Someone is.
The men stare one another down. POLLIVER rises to attack, but the HOUND turns over the table, knocking him down. He then sets to the room and dispatches the soldiers one by one, while the INNKEEPER cowers. The fight is brutal, using both sword and fist. POLLIVER and a companion. are able to get the upper hand, and the HOUND falls to the ground, where they kick at him violently. ARYA watches in fright. The HOUND manages to fend them off with his sword, even from the ground. He sweeps the legs out from under one of them, and POLLIVER scambles on all fours towards his sword. The HOUND steps on the blade and slugs POLLIVER violently, who crumples to the ground. The fight continues, and the HOUND gores another soldier before TOMMY pins the HOUND to the ground, a dagger to his throat. With great strength, the HOUND pulls the man's dagger away from his throat while gouging at his face. He positions the man's face over his own dagger, and swiftly slams the soldier's face into the dagger, repeatedly.
ARYA moves from shock into action. She shatters a jug over a soldier's head, then picks up a sword and stabs him through, slowly. She comes up behind POLLIVER, who is stalking the wounded HOUND, and stabs him through. She takes need from him before he falls forward to the ground. The HOUND runs another soldier through. ARYA walks calmly over POLLIVER, who lays on his back.
ARYA: Something wrong with your leg, boy?
POLLIVER: What? What do you mean?
ARYA: Can you walk? I've got to carry you?
POLLIVER: Carry me?
ARYA: Fine little blade.
ARYA puts the point of her blade under POLLIVER's chin. He raises his hands weakly in surrender.
ARYA: Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
A light of recognition fills POLLIVER's eyes, met quickly by ARYA stabbing him through the chin, slowly. He gasps and gurgles. She removes her sword and watches the blood fill his mouth. He chokes, spurts, and dies.
EXT. Outside the inn
The HOUND rides his mount, chewing on some chicken. ARYA comes into view behind him on her own white horse. She looks pleased. They ride through the devastation of the countryside.
EXT: Woods.
Dogs bark and a woman laughs. Another woman breathes in panic, gasping for breath
Ramsay: Tansy! Tansy! Tansy!
RAMSAY and MYRANDA run together, holding hands. They each hold a bow as they run.  They are happy, excited and enjoying themselves. THEON limps behind them, trying to keep up. The hunting dogs continue to bark.
RAMSAY: Tansy! Tansy!
TANSY runs through the woods, the hunting dogs barking in pursuit. Further behind are RAMSAY, MYRANDA and THEON.
RAMSAY: There you are.
TANSAY: (screams)
MYRANDA: (laughing) I can't see her, Ramsay.
RAMSAY: Tansy!
RAMSAY notches an arrow. TANSY pauses at a tree, gasping for breath. RAMSAY's arrow strikes the tree, just inches from her face. She screams, and begins running again.
RAMSAY: If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run!
MYRANDA expertly notches an arrow and lets it fly. It flies past TANSY, who stumbles down into a muddy stream, gasping and screaming. She scrambles on all fours in panic, pauses to hide in the shadowed stream bed. She sobs.
RAMSAY: Tansy.
MYRANDA: Where is she?
RAMSAY: Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!
The hunting dogs come barreling down the stream bed towards TANSY. She shrieks and whimpers, and starts running once again. The dogs chase her through a small tunnel and back into the woods proper. MYRANDA lets another arrow fly, with concentration and precision. It hits TANSY in the leg, and she falls, sobbing. The dogs terrorize her. RAMSAY, MYRANDA and THEON catch up.
RAMSAY: Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too.
MYRANDA:  I only wounded her.
RAMSAY:  You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?
THEON: A fine shot, master. My lady.
TANSY: Please, my lord. It hurts.
RAMSAY: Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon.
MYRANDA notches another arrow at takes aim.
MYRANDA: She thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face.
RAMSAY: We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work.
TANSY: Why? I did whatever you asked.
RAMSAY: But you made Myranda feel jealous.
MYRANDA lowers her bow, a bit taken aback.
MYRANDA:  Me jealous of her?
TANSY: My lord, please.
RAMSAY: You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
RAMSAY turns from jaunty to ferocious.
RAMSAY: Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!
Off camera, the dogs tear into TANSY. She screams. THEON watches, dejected and powerless. Sounds of ripping flesh and TANSY screaming fill the woods.
RAMSAY: Not so pretty now.
TANSY's screams have stopped, but the sounds of ripping flesh continue. THEON struggles to hold back tears.
INT: King's Landing.
PODRICK serves sausages to TYRION. JAIME sits at the table, uncomfortably.
TYRION: Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?
PODRICK: Is it solid gold?
JAIME: Gilded steel.
TYRION: You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
JAIME: I'm not hungry.
TYRION: You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.
TYRION raises his cup.
TYRION: A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.
JAIME moves to raise his own cup, but knocks it over clumsily with is left hand.
JAIME:  Oh!
PODRICK: I'll clean it up.
JAIME: No, I'll do it. Leave us.
PODRICK exits, while JAIME places his cup right-side up.
TYRION: It's only wine.
He holds up his own cup and pours it out onto the table. JAIME sits back in resignation. TYRION stands and pours more wine.
JAIME: I can't fight anymore.
TYRION: What about your left?
JAIME: I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?
TYRION: You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
JAIME: I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
TYRION: Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand.
TYRION sits back down.
JAIME: With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.
TYRION: You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one.
EXT: A rocky King's Landing shoreline.
BRONN appears, carrying some swords. He joins JAIME, who sits by the shore.
JAIME: My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.
BRONN: He tells me you shit gold just like your father.
JAIME: Is this place safe?
JAIME tosses a pouch of gold to BRONN.
BRONN: There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield.
JAIME: Uh-huh.
BRONN: Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.
BRONN pockets the gold. JAIME gets his sword, and spins it in his wrist to warm it. BRONN whistles in admiration.
BRONN: I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to.
BRONN stands, holding two sparring swords.
BRONN: And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me.
He drops one to the ground, clattering, and continues to walk forward.
JAIME: I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
JAIME walks to the sparring sword, indignant. He reaches for it, but BRONN slaps his hand with his sword, just as he grabs it.
JAIME: Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down.
BRONN: Best time to attack a man.
BRONN swings at JAIME, who parries clumsily. BRONN pushes him, and JAIME falters to the wall.
BRONN: Mind yourself. JAIME;  If I still had my right hand...
BRONN:  Plan on growing it back?
They engage in swordplay. JAIME parries defensively, but well. However, BRONN gets him off balance again and causes him to stumble with a forearm nudge. JAIME recovers and faces him. JAIME pants and resets.
JAIME: Come on, then.
JAIME makes an awkward attack, and they continue.
EXT: The Dreadfort at night.
Some riders gallops down the Dreadfort road,
MAN: Open the gates!
EXT: The Dreadfort courtyard
The men swing open the door and the riders enter.
MAN: Riders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to!
RAMSAY stands to greet the riders. ROOSE BOLTON and WALDA dismount and approach.
RAMSAY: Father. Welcome home.
ROOSE: Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.
RAMSEY steps forward to greet her, warmly smiling.
RAMSAY: A pleasure, Mother.
RAMSAY kisses her cheek. WALDA smiles awkwardly.
WALDA: Hello.
ROOSE: See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers.
WOMAN: This way, my lady.
WALDA and the WOMAN exit.
ROOSE: Where is your prize?
RAMSAY: With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
ROOSE exits, and RAMSAY greets LOCKE. They walk together
RAMSAY: I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
LOCKE: Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.
RAMSAY: (laughs)
CUT TO: Dreadfort interior.
ROOSE sits down by the fire, aching and exhausted from the ride. RAMSAY and THEON enter. A MAN stands in the background, sharpening a shaving razor against a strop.
RAMSAY: Father.
ROOSE rises to inspect THEON.
ROOSE: What did you do to him?
RAMSAY: I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned.
ROOSE: You flayed him.
RAMSAY: Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
ROOSE: This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
RAMSAY: We've been flaying our enemies for 1,000 years. The flayed man is on our banners.
ROOSE: My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.
RAMSAY: I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no...
ROOSE: You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
RAMSAY: You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
ROOSE: I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
RAMSAY: Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us.
ROOSE: I placed far too much trust in you.
RAMSAY: Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful.
THEON:  I'm sorry, my lord.
RAMSAY:  Give him the razor.
RAMSAY sits.
RAMSAY: If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?
THEON stakes the razor and the shaving cream.
RAMSAY: Go on, Reek. A nice close shave.
THEON lathers RAMSAY's face and begins to shave it carefully.
RAMSAY: Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?
THEON: I don't know, my lord.
ROOSE: You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
RAMSAY: Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?
THEON: No, my lord. Just two farm boys.
RAMSAY: And crisped them so no one would know.
THEON: Yes, my lord.
RAMSAY: The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone.
THEON continues to shave RAMSAY and holds the razor on RAMSAY's throat. RAMSAY goads him.
RAMSAY: Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?
THEON's hand twitches, and he struggles with himself. Then he continues to shave RAMSAY slowly.
ROOSE: You ready for a hunt?
MERYN TRANT: Always. Find those boys and I'll give you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.
LOCKE: Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
THEON: Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
LOCKE: Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
ROOSE: Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
RAMSEY stands, cleanly shaven.
RAMSAY: Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat.
ROOSE: You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position.
EXT: King's Landing garden.
TYRION and PODRICK meet VARYS.
TYRION: Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
VARYS: I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
TYRION: Oh, to be foreign.
VARYS: Ahem.
PODRICK stands aside as TYRION and VARYS head down a more secluded path.
VARYS: Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
TYRION: So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
VARYS: No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear.
TYRION:  Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
VARYS: No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
TYRION: She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.
VARYS: Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
VARYS bows and leaves. TYRION fumes.
EXT: A garden party.
SANSA, TYRION, JOFFREY, TYWIN, CERSEI, TOMMEN and PYCELLE sit at an outdoor banquet table. MACE TYRELL stands before them.
MACE: From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup.
He places the up before JOFFREY.
MACE: May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
JOFFREY: A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?
MACE: I shall be honored, Your Grace.
MACE bows and exits. SHAE brings a tray to the table and sets it before SANSA.
CERSEI: She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.
SHAE exits.
TYWIN: Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
TYRION looks concerned. PODRICK places a large tome before JOFFREY and TYRION walks to the front of the table
JOFFREY: A book?
TYRION:  "The Lives of Four Kings." Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read.
JOFFREY is at a loss for words. TYWIN entreats him to respond.
JOFFREY: Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle.
TYRION bows. SHAE watches. The MOUNTAIN brings forth a sword and lays it on the table before JOFFREY. TYWIN stands.
TYWIN: One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor.
Excitedly, JOFFREY walks around the table. Exuberantly, he unsheaths the sword.
PYCELLE: Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.
JOFFREY: So they say.
JOFFREY steps away, then spins and cleaves the book that TYRION just gave him, repeatedly. People gasp in response. JOFFREY is very pleased.
JOFFREY: Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?
MAN: Stormbringer.
MAN #2: Terminus.
MAN #3: Widow's Wail.
MAN #4: Wolfsbane. -
JOFFREY: Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off. Ned Stark's head all over again.
JOFFREY sheaths the sword. SANSA looks dejected. He sits down next to MACE and SHAE continues to look on.
INT: TYRION's chambers
The door opens and SHAE walks in, smiling.
TYRION: Don't.
SHAE: You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?
TYRION: Don't call me that.
SHAE: What should I call you?
TYRION: I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
SHAE: Our friendship?
TYRION: There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
SHAE: What? You'll have your own cabin, of course, and across the Narrow Sea a house, servants.
SHAE: What is this?
TYRION: I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows.
SHAE: She doesn't want you.
TYRION:  I need to do right by her.
SHAE: You don't want her.
TYRION:  By our children.
SHAE: What are you afraid of?
TYRION:  I'm not afraid.
SHAE: You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?  I need you to leave.
SHAE: I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.
TYRION:  Shae.
SHAE: We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine.
TYRION: You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? 500? 5,000?
SHAE: How many whores have you been with?
TYRION: I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
TYRION walks over and opens the door. SHAE sobs. BRONN enters.
TYRION: You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.
SHAE continues to sob. BRONN clasps her shoulder to lead her out. She turns quickly and slaps him, then storms off, crying. BRONN looks to TYRION, then exits. TYRION walks to the table and violently slaps his cup to the ground.
EXT: Stannis's army camp in the  Stormlands at night.
A woman screams. A line of men are bound on top of unlit bonfires, including AXELL FLORENT. The soldiers mill about, carrying torches.
MELISANDRE: Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness.
AXELL FLORENT: Sire, I served you well.
The crowd chants along with MELISANDRE
MELISANDRE: Lord of Light, show us the way...
AXELL FLORENT: Selyse, you're my sister!
SELYSE: (Chanting with the others) Yours are the stars that guide us.
AXELL FLORENT: Tell him! Tell him!
MELISANDRE: Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.
The bonfires ignite quickly. The men scream in agony and die.
SELYSE: (to STANNIS) Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?
STANNIS leaves without responding. DAVOS trails him.
DAVOS: Lord Florent was your brother by law. STANNIS; He was an infidel.
DAVOS: He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too.
STANNIS: I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
DAVOS: How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?
STANNIS: A good deal more than you.
STANNIS exits and SELYSE catches up, accompanied by MELISANDRE.
SELYSE: Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?
DAVOS: I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen.
MELISANDRE walks past DAVOS and he watches, silently.
INT: Storm's End Dining room
Stannis sits at table with SELYSE and MELISANDRE.
STANNIS: Meat's off.
SELYSE: Our larders are almost empty.
STANNIS: Serve fish, then. We're on an island.
SELYSE: You hate fish.
STANNIS: I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same.
SELYSE: (to MELISANDRE) When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?
STANNIS: Of course I remember.
SELYSE: Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?
MELISANDRE: It's all I knew when I was a child.
SELYSE: Until you found the Lord of Light?
MELISANDRE: Until he found me.
SELYSE: I fear for our daughter's soul.
MELISANDRE: Every mother should fear for her child's soul.
SELYSE: She's a stubborn little beast.
STANNIS:  She's a child.
SELYSE: You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
STANNIS: She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
SELYSE: As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
INT: SHIREEN's bedroom after dinner.
A knock on the door.
SHIREEN: Come in.
MELISANDRE enters.
MELISANDRE: Were you sleeping, Princess?
SHIREEN: (Shakes her head)
MELISANDRE:  Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
SHIREEN: I heard it.
MELISANDRE: And it frightened you?
SHIREEN: Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
MELISANDRE: They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.
SHIREEN: But they screamed.
MELISANDRE: Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
SHIREEN: Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
MELISANDRE: You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess.
SHIREEN: And you didn't have this.
MELISANDRE: No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?
SHIREEN: I read "The Seven-Pointed Star."
MELISANDRE sits next to SHIREEN to comfort her.
MELISANDRE: Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war.
SHIREEN: There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
MELISANDRE: There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now.
EXT: The North at night.
Heavy breathing as the camera pans through the snowy woods. Suddenly, the camera lurches forward and comes upon a deer and the camera attacks viciously,  a wolf's hunt from the predator's point of view.  Hodor: Hodor.
CUT TO: Bran awakening. HODOR, MEERA and JOJEN are with him. BRAN is frantic and panting.
BRAN: Why did you wake me?
MEERA: You've been gone for hours.
BRAN: I was hungry.
MEERA: We're all hungry.
BRAN: I was just eating.
JOJEN: Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran.
BRAN eats some morsels given to him by MEERA.
JOJEN: Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human.
MEERA: You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything.
EXT: The North.
HODOR pulls BRAN through the woods on a sled. MEERA and JOJEN walk beside them. A wolf barks. They pause and BRAN turns to see his wolf, Summer.
BRAN: Hodor, take me to the tree.
HODOR carries BRAN to the base of the tree, sets him down and steps back. The bark seems to have twisted into a human face. BRAN touches it and launches into a vision of the Godswood, a THREE-EYED RAVEN, a sword, NED STARK's worried face, the Godswood again. Time speeds forward.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: Look for me... beneath the tree.
The THREE-EYED RAVEN lands on the branch of a Godswood. A storm of crows flies into a standing BRAN. A castle interior, an undead horse,
CERSEI: He saw us.
BRAN falls from the Winterfell tower. A dragon's shadow sweeps over King's Landing.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: North.
BRAN gasps and releases his hand from the twisted face on the tree. The vision has ended. MEERA and JOJEN approach.
BRAN: I know where we have to go.
INT: King's Landing, the Sept of Baelor.
MARGAERY and MACE walk down the aisle. MACE hands her to JOFFREY. The pair continue up the steps to the HIGH SEPTON. He places a cape over her shoulders. They clasp hands and they bar bound together.
HIGH SEPTON: Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder.
JOFFREY: With this kiss, I pledge my love.
JOFFREY and MARGAERY kiss. The crowd applauds.
SANSA: We have a new queen.
TYRION: Better her than you.
EXT: King's Landing Garden.
TYWIN and OLENNA talk in the garden as the wedding guests filter out.
TYWIN: Bit much, wouldn't you say?
OLENNA:  It feels proportionate.
TYWIN:  Proportionate to what?
OLENNA: The expected extravagance.
TYWIN: People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
OLENNA: You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
MACE approaches and ties to join them.
OLENNA: Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking.
TYWIN and OLENNA continue, while MACE rears back.
OLENNA: Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share.
TYWIN: Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
OLENNA: No, your heartfelt thank-you is it's own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. "The Iron Bank will have it's due." How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.
TYWIN: I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
OLENNA: We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.
CUT TO; The wedding reception.
Jugglers and firebreathers, some on stilts, entertain the crowd. BRONN, TYRION and PODRICK walk among the tables.
BRONN: All taken care of.
TYRION: You saw her board the ship?
BRONN: Aye, she's on it.
TYRION: You saw the ship sail away?
BRONN: No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.
TYRION: How do you know?
BRONN: Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow.
TYRION: There's someone following you?
BRONN turns and clasps TYRION's shoulder.
BRONN: She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing.
BRONN exits.
TYRION and PODRICK walk through the party. They encounter OBERYN and ELLARIA.
OBERYN: Hello.
TYRION: Hello.
OBERYN: Not you.
OBERYN and ELLARIA are enthralled by a contortionist. TYRION and PODRICK walk on.
CUT TO: The head table.
JOFFREY watches the party. OLENNA approaches SANSA.
OLENNA: You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.
TYRION enters and sits.
TYRION: My lady. My lady.
OLENNA: Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.
MUSICIAN: A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine,  my lord...
MARGAERY is enjoying the performance, but JOFFREY is bored. He stands and throws some coins to them.
JOFFREY: Very good. Very good. Off you go.
The musicians scrabble to pick up the coins, and depart quickly. MARGAERY moves to calm JOFFREY. CERSEI watches jealously, TOMMEN at her side.  MARGAERY; My love, why don't we make the announcement?
JOFFREY stands and clanks his goblet for attention.
JOFFREY: Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.
The crowd applauds as JOFFREY sits and MARGAERY stands.
MARGAERY: We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city.
The crowd applauds, and JOFFREY adores it. CERSEI comes over to MARGAERY.
CERSEI: You're an example to us all.
CERSEI kisses her on each cheek.
LORAS stands in the distance, and catches OBERYN's eye as he cuddles with ELLARIA. LORAS accidentally backs into JAIME.
LORAS: Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.
JAIME: Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful.
LORAS: As does yours.
JAIME: So, looking forward to your wedding?
LORAS: Yes, very much.
JAIME: Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
LORAS: They certainly are.
JAIME: Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her.
LORAS: And neither will you.
LORAS pats JAIME on the shoulder, and exits. BRIENNE approaches the head table, and bows.
MARGAERY stands and shakes her hand.
MARGAERY:  Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.
BRIENNE: I'm no lady, Your Grace.
CERSEI: Did you just bow?
BRIENNE: Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy.
JOFFREY: You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
MARGAERY: That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it.
JOFFREY: A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
BRIENNE:  I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
JOFFREY: Yes, yes.
MARGAERY: Thank you. I hope we see more of you.
BRIENNE departs, and the camera follows her. CERSEI intercepts her.
CERSEI: Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
BRIENNE: As you say, Your Grace.
CERSEI: I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
BRIENNE: In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once.
CERSEI: Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
BRIENNE:  Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.
CERSEI: I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
BRIENNE: I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.
CERSEI: But you love him.
BREINNE does not answer.
BRIENNE: Your Grace.
BRIENNE exits, and JAIME notices their conversation.
CUT TO; The head table.
PYCELLE has cornered a maid.
PYCELLE: No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally.
CERSEI:  She'll do no such thing.
PYCELLE: Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice...
CERSEI: You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
MAID: Your Grace.
The MAID exits.
PYCELLE:  Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
CERSEI: More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
PYCELLE: Your Grace, I am a man of learning.
CERSEI: My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
PYCELLE: I never meant to annoy anyone.
CERSEI: But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
PYCELLE: Your Grace, Queen Margaery...
CERSEI: The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
PYCELLE exits, and CERSEI smiles.
CUT: the head table, where JOFFREY and MARGAERY watch a fool juggling. Once again, JOFFREY is not amused. He stands.
JOFFREY: A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
The fool is suddenly pelted with food, and he runs off. CERSEI and TYWIN enter.
TYWIN: You're in rather a good mood.
CERSEI: I suppose I am.
TYWIN: I won't ask why.
CERSEI: Small pleasures.
OBERYN and ELLARIA enter.
OBERYN: Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
TYWIN: Prince Oberyn.
OBERYN: I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand.
ELLARIA:  My lord. My lady.
TYWIN: Charmed.
CERSEI: Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
ELLARIA: We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.
OBERYN: Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.
CERSEI: No? How tolerant of you.
OBERYN: I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.
CERSEI: I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.
TYWIN: Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.
OBERYN: They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.
TYWIN: Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
OBERYN: People everywhere have their differences. In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.
JOFFREY taps his goblet.
JOFFREY: Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies...
A lever is pulled. A giant lion's mouth opens. A red carpet rolls down.
JOFFREY: I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings.
Five dwarves come down from the lion's mouth, each dressed as one of the five kings. They run about,  playing their roles with comic glee. The crowd applauds. JOFFREY is very pleased. TYRION, less so.
RENLY DWARF: I'm the rightful king.
ROBB DWARF: King in the North!
JOFFREY DWARF: Yes!
BALON DWARF: Traitor. You're a traitor.
JOFFREY DWARF: For the Seven Kingdoms!
The dwarves line up on the stage.
JOFFREY DWARF: Let the war begin.
The crowd applauds. RENLY DWARF starts the prance about the stage.
STANNIS DWARF: Renly, you're no king.
BALON DWARF: Away, degenerate. Away. Away.
RENLY DWARF: Ooh, careful.
STANNIS DWARF:  Go on.
RENLY DWARF: I want you to be my prince. Stannis!
STANNIS DWARF and RENLY DWARF feign some indecent acts. LORAS leaves in disgust.
BALON DWARF: Who's got the gold now, Stark?
ROBB DWARF: I am the rightful king.
BALON DWARF: Challenge me, ruffian.
ROBB DWARF: Take that. -
BALON DWARF:  I'm drowning. I'm drowning.
ROBB DWARF: I am the King in the North!
TYRION and SANSA are not amused.
JOFFREY DWARF shoots and arrow and hits STANNIS DWARF.
STANNIS DWARF: Not wildfire!
The crowd applauds. STANNIS DWARF runs off the stage, crying.
TYRON: Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
PODRICK: Yes, my lord.
TYRION: We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
JOFFREY is enjoying the spectacle, but MARGAERY is not.
JOFFREY DWARF and ROBB DWARF are having a stand off.
JOFFREY DWARF: Charge!
They run past one another without landing a blow.
JOFFREY DWARF: Ready, again.
JOFFREY DWARF: Charge! Yes!
This time, JOFFREY DWARD knocks off ROBB DWARF"s wolf helmet.
JOFFREY DWARF: Your head!
SANSA is mortified. JOFFREY laughs hysterically while MARGAERY looks at him, appalled.
ROBB DWARF falls. The crowd applauds. JOFFREY DWARF claims victory.
JOFFREY grabs his golbet.
JOFFREY DWARF feigns sodomizing the wolf head. SANSA is motionless. JOFFREY spits out his wine, laughing.
JOFFREY DWARF: Fine gentlemen.
The players take their bow and the crowd applauds. JOFFREY stands.
JOFFREY: Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.
The crowd laughs. Tyrion stands.
TYRION: One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.
TYRION sits, and JOFFREY is angered at his insults. The crowd quiets. JOFFREY walks over and pours his wine on TYRION's head. MARGAERY sits motionless.
TYRION: A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
JOFFREY: It did not spill.
MARGAERY: My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast.
JOFFREY: Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.
TYRION: Your Grace does me a great honor.
JOFFREY: It's not meant as an honor.
TYRION stands and walks over to JOFFREY, who purposely drops his goblet. As TYRION tried to pick it up, he kicks it away.
JOFFREY:  Bring me my goblet.
TYRION kneels down to get the goblet. SANSA watches JOFFREY. She picks up the goblet and hands it to TYRION. He brings it to JOFFREY.
JOFFREY: What good is an empty cup? Fill it.
TYRION pours wine for JOFFREY in front of CERSEI, and hands it to him.
JOFFREY: Kneel. Kneel before your king.
TYRION does not budge.
JOFFREY: Kneel. I said... kneel!
MARGAERY: (Standing) Look, the pie.
The crowd applauds, and the attention turns to the giant pie carried in by four men.
JOFFREY: My queen.
JOFFREY strides forward, and hews the pie with his sword. To his surprise, doves are released from the pie. He looks triumphant.
MARGAERY: Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero.
The pie is served to the guests.
SANSA:  Can we leave now?
TYRION:  Let's find out.
MARGAERY feeds a forkful of pie to JOFFREY.
JOFFREY: Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cupbearer, remember?
TYRION: I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.
JOFFREY: No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine.
TYRION looks to SANSA.
JOFFREY: Well, hurry up. This pie is dry.
TYRION and fumes has he gets the goblet for JOFFREY. JOFFREY drinks deeply.
JOFFREY: Mm, good. Needs washing down.
TYRION: If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.
JOFFREY: No. (coughing) No, you'll wait here... un...
JOFFREY grabs his own throat, choking.
TYRION: Your Grace?
JOFFREY: It's nothing.
MARGAERY: He's choking!
OLENNA: Help the poor boy.
JOFFREY turns towards the crowd, choking and staggering.
OLENNA: Idiots, help your king. -
JAIME: Move away!
JAIME runs to JOFFREY, as he vomits.
JAIME: Joffrey! Joffrey!
CERSEI runs to them.
CERSEI:  Help him! Someone help him!
JOFFREY: (gags)
CERSEI: Joffrey!
SER DONTOS: (to SANSA) Come with me now.
CERSEI: Joffrey! Joffrey!
TYRION and MARGAERY watch, aghast. CERSEI and JAIME continue to try to help JOFFREY.
SER DONTOS: If you want to live, we have to leave.
CERSEI: Don't touch him!
JOFFREY gurgles and chokens. His face is turning purple, his eyes glazed, vomit lining his cheeks. He spasms.
CERSEI: Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!
Blood streams out of JOFFREY's nose. He convulses painfully. CERSEI cries as she watches him. He reaches a hand out towards TYRION, who at that moment picks up the goblet from before him. JOFFREY gaps a final time as blood continues to stream from his nose, his face a horrid shade of purple. He dies.
CERSEI: My son.
MAN: He's gone. Our king is gone.
CERSEI: He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!
Two guards grab TYRION. CERSEI looks upon the lifeless body of JOFFREY.
EXT. KING'S LANDING
The wedding banquet for Margaery and Joffrey has turned shocking and horrific. Joffrey lays dead in his mother's lap. Blood pours from his nose and vomit clings around his mouth. Cersei turns to Tyrion.
CERSEI: You did this. You did this!
Three guards grab Tyrion from behind. As Sansa looks on, Ser Dontos Hollard approaches her.
SER DONTOS: We have to leave.
CERSEI: Take him! Take him!
Tyrion is dragged off by guards as Sansa and Ser Dontos rush off through the crowd.
CERSEI: Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
TYWIN: Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
CERSEI: Where is she?!
TYWIN: No one leaves the capital! No one!
EXT. KINGS LANDING DOCK AT DUSK
A bell tolls as Sansa and Ser Dontos rush down to a small boat, separate from the Harbor.
SER DONTOS: Get in.
SANSA: Where are we going?
SER DONTOS: Somewhere safe.
Sansa and Ser Dontos sail out into the ocean, far from King's Landing.
EXT. MISTY OCEAN AT NIGHT
They come across a huge mysterious ship in the middle of the misty sea. Ser Dontos pulls his smaller boat up alongside it.
SER DONTOS: Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know.
Sansa climbs the latter.
EXT. LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER
She climbs up a ladder on the side of the ship, as she reaches the top someone grabs her. She gasps before realizing who it is.
SANSA: Lord Baelish?
LITTLEFINGER: Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?
SANSA: (shakes her head.)
LITTLEFINGER: Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past.  Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
SER DONTOS: Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.
LITTLEFINGER: Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water.
SER DONTOS: I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.  LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?
SER DONTOS: 10,000.
Littlefinger clicks his finger and two men with crossbows walk to the edge of the ship. They aim at Ser Dontos.
SER DONTOS: Wait!
Both men shoot at Ser Dontos, he groans in pain before lying dead. Sansa screams and Littlefinger hushes her.
LITTLEFINGER: Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?
SANSA: I didn't murder anyone.
LITTLEFINGER: I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.
Sansa glances back to Ser Dontos' body.
SANSA: Why did you kill him?
LITTLEFINGER: Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
SANSA: He saved me.
LITTLEFINGER: Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever.
SANSA: He was helping me because I saved his life.
LITTLEFINGER: Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard.
Littlefinger removes the necklace from around Sansa's neck and places it on the edge of the ship. He pull out a knife and hits one of the "crystals" and it smashes like glass. Sansa, confused, studies him.
LITTLEFINGER: I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
SANSA: We're all liars here.
Littlefinger pushes the necklace off the edge of the boat and it lands directly on Ser Dontos' lifeless body.
LITTLEFINGER: Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home.
Margaery Tyrell sits at the table with Olenna Tyrell.
MARGAERY: So am I the queen?
OLENNA: More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.
MARGAERY: Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible.
OLENNA: The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it.
MARGAERY: What was it like?
OLENNA: They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
MARGAERY: One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
OLENNA: Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.
MARGAERY: But I would have been the queen.
OLENNA: Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
Joffrey's body is laid on a table in the center on the room. Cersei, Tommen and Tywin and stand around him. Tywin turns to Tommen.
TYWIN: Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
Tommen stays quiet.
TYWIN: I'm not trying to trick you.
TOMMEN: It means I'll become king.
TYWIN: Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?
TOMMEN: A good king?
TYWIN: Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?
CERSEI: This is hardly the place or the time.
TOMMEN: Holiness?
TYWIN: Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
TOMMEN: Justice.
TYWIN: Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
TOMMEN: No.
TYWIN: No.
TOMMEN: What about strength?
TYWIN: Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?
TOMMEN: Wisdom.
TYWIN: Yes!
TOMMEN: Wisdom is what makes a good king.
TYWIN: Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
TOMMEN: No.
TYWIN: No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?
Tywin and Tommen begin walking up the steps to leave the Sept.
TOMMEN: A king needs a queen.
TYWIN: Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?
TOMMEN: Yes.
TYWIN: Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?
TOMMEN: I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
JAIME enters.
JAIME: How are you?
TOMMEN:  I'm all right.
JAIME:You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
TYWIN and TOMMEN exit.
JAIME: Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
HIGH SEPTON: Yes, my lord. All of you.
The High Septon snaps his fingers and the priests exit.
CERSEI: It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. "A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth." That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he...
JAIME: I don't know what I saw.
CERSEI: Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
JAIME: Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
CERSEI: I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. (CRYING) Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy.
JAIME consoles CERSEI. They kiss. CERSEI steps back and gasps.
JAIME: You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
JAIME grabs CERSEI and forcefully kisses her. He presses against her.
CERSEI: Jaime, not here, please. Please.
JAIME rips at her dress. They end up tangled on the floor by the altar.
CERSEI: Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
JAIME: No.
CERSEI: Stop it. Stop.
She continues to resist, but her resolve is weakening. They kiss, and JAIME brings her to the ground and forces himself on her.
CERSEI: Stop.  Stop. It's not right.
JAIME: (GRUNTS)
CERSEI: It's not right. It's not right.
JAIME:  I don't care.
CERSEI: (CRYING)  Don't.
JAIME: I don't care.
CERSEI: Don't. Jaime, don't.
JAIME: I don't care.
EXT: RIVERLANDS AT NIGHT
Thunder rumbles as the HOUND relieves himself and ARYA plucks the leaves from a plant.
ARYA: Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
HOUND: Near Fairmarket, I think.
ARYA: You think? You don't have a map?
HOUND: No, I don't have a map.
ARYA: Maybe we should get one.
HOUND: Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
ARYA: How far is it to the Eyrie?
HOUND: Far.
ARYA: And you're sure we're going the right way?
The HOUND feed his mount some water.
HOUND: Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way.
ARYA: On your way where?
HOUND:  Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me.
ARYA: I'd like to see Braavos one day.
HOUND: Why Braavos?
ARYA: I have friends there.
HOUND:  I doubt it.
FARMER HAMLET: Seven blessings to you.
FARMER HAMLET and SALLY sit in their wagon above them.
HOUND:  What do you want?
FARMER HAMLET: What do I want? This is my land.
HOUND:  If I'm standing on it, it's my land.
ARYA: We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
FARMER HAMLET: (nods)
ARYA: He's never been the same.
FARMER HAMLET: Which house did he fight for?
ARYA: The Tullys of Riverrun.
FARMER HAMLET: There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it.
CUT TO: FARMER'S HOME.
Thunder rumbles and the rain patters. FARMER HAMLET and SALLY host ARYA and the HOUND for dinner.
FARMER HAMLET: We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
HOUND: You got to do all seven of the fuckers?
ARYA: Father!
FARMER HAMLET: We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
HOUND: And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
The HOUND impatiently grabs the pot and pours himself some soup.
ARYA: I'm so sorry.
The HOUND and ARYA slurp hungrily. FARMER HAMLET and SALLY watch, a bit appalled at their manners.
ARYA: Really good.
FARMER HAMLET: Did you fight at the Twins?
HOUND: Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
FARMER HAMLET: The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
HOUND: Guest right don't mean much anymore.
FARMER HAMLET: It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour.
HOUND: You got any ale?
FARMER HAMLET:  Afraid not.
HOUND: How can a man not keep ale in his home?
FARMER HAMLET:  You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense.
HOUND: What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?
HOUND: (Nods) Fair wages for fair work.
Chickens cluck as ARYA sleeps in the hay. Faint voices argue. A punch lands, a man groans and a girl screams.
EXT: BARN
ARYA leaves the barn and strides towards the HOUND, FARMER HAMLET and SALLY. The farmer lies on the ground and SALLY tends him. The HOUND has taken something and is walking away.
ARYA: What did you do?!
HOUND:  Get your horse saddled.
ARYA: You told me you weren't a thief.
HOUND: I wasn't.
ARYA: He took us in. He fed us and you...
HOUND: Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter.
ARYA: You don't know that.
HOUND: I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
ARYA: You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
HOUND: There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
Two rangers walk through the courtyard, taking account of the new recruits.
RANGER: Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.
SAM passes them and encounters ALLISER THORNE and JANOS SLYNT at the stairwell.
ALLISER THORNE: There he is, Sam the Slayer.
JANOS SLYNT: Going to visit your wildling whore?
SAM: She's not a whore.
JANOS SLYNT: No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
INT.: CASTLE BLACK
GILLY lets SAM into the room.
SAM: They all think I'm lying.
GILLY: About what?
SAM: Killing the white Walker.
GILLY:  You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.
GILLY touches LITTLE SAM.
SAM: But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
GILLY:  A what?
SAM: Well, a wildling.
GILLY: My father hated that word.
SAM: It's not a very nice word, I suppose.
GILLY:  I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?
SAM sits next to her to help with the plucking.
SAM: So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
GILLY: I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
SAM: I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
GILLY: Why do you worry about it?
SAM: 100 men, one woman.
GILLY: They've got other things to think about.
SAM: That's the only thing they think about.
GILLY: You're being silly.
SAM:  I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
GILLY: What about you?
SAM: What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
GILLY:  Thank you.
SAM: For what?
GILLY: For worrying about me.
SAM: I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep.
GILLY: So what are you saying?
SAM: Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
GILLY: Are you bored of me?
SAM: Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
GILLY:  I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.
GILLY picks up the chickens and exits. SAM tends to LITTLE SAM.
INT. DRAGONSTONE AT NIGHT
STANNIS stands looking at the storm. DAVOS enters.
DAVOS: Your Grace.
STANNIS: You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
DAVOS picks up a scroll and struggles to read it.
DAVOS: Joffrey?
STANNIS: The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
DAVOS: I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night...
STANNIS: What progress have you made?
While DAVOS names houses, STANNIS picks up pieces from the war table, snaps them and discards them.
DAVOS: I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
STANNIS: House Peasebury.
DAVOS: House Musgood.
STANNIS:  House Musgood.
DAVOS: And House Haigh.
STANNIS: House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
DAVOS: Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.
STANNIS:  The Golden Company?
DAVOS: They've never broken a contract.
STANNIS: They're sellswords.
DAVOS: We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground.
STANNIS: We don't have any gold.
DAVOS: Not yet.
STANNIS:  If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -
INT DRAGONSTONE, SHIREEN's room.
DAVOS knocks and enters.
SHIREEN: You're late.
DAVOS: I'm sorry, Princess.
SHIREEN: I thought you weren't coming.
DAVOS: The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
SHIREEN: You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say "ka-nigit."
DAVOS: That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you.
SHIREEN: It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.
DAVOS sits and takes up a book to practice reading.
SHIREEN:  You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.
DAVOS: "The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos."
SHIREEN claps.
DAVOS: Thank you very much.
SHIREEN: I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.
DAVOS: No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler.
SHIREEN: What's the difference?
DAVOS: Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right.
SHIREEN: My father says a criminal is a criminal.
DAVOS: Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
SHIREEN: You've sailed to Braavos?
DAVOS:  Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction...
DAVOS has an inspired thought. He gets up, paces and then kisses SHIREEN on the forehead.
SHIREEN:  What was that for?
DAVOS:  I need you to write a message.
SHIREEN: You should write it yourself. It's good practice.
DAVOS: It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
He hands her a quill and scroll. She begins to write.
DAVOS: To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
SHIREEN: But that's not you.
DAVOS: I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.

INT. MOLE'S TOWN INN
SAM, GILLY and LITTLE SAM enter the tavern. A MOLE'S TOWN WHORE approaches GILLY while SAM talks to the MOLE'S TOWN MADAM.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Precious little thing.
GILLY: Thank you.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: What's his name?
GILLY: Sam.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Lovely. That the daddy?
GILLY: No.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Where's the daddy?
GILLY: He's dead.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Oh. Where you from?
GILLY: North of here.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: North of here? You a fucking wildling?
MOLE'S TOWN MADAM: Only room and board?
SAM: That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
MOLE'S TOWN MADAM: Could find other work for her, too.
SAM: No other work.
MOLE'S TOWN MADAM: There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.
SAM: No other work.
INT. MOLE'S TOWN BROTHEL BACK ROOM
SAM: I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
GILLY: You protected me north of the Wall.
SAM: This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's.
LITTLE SAM cries
SAM: You have to trust me. It's for the best.
GILLY puts LITTLE SAM down.
GILLY: Best for you.
SAM: Oh, Gilly. Please don't.
LITTLE SAM cries and GILLY tends him. SAM exits
INT. KING'S LANDING
ELLARIA, MAREI, a WHORE, OBERYN and OLYVAR  are engaged in passionate sex. ELLARIA turns her attention from MAREI to OLYVAR.
OBERYN: Greedy.
ELLARIA kissed OLYVAR deeply, but he does not return her ardor.
ELLARIA: No?
OLYVAR: I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste.
OBERYN: You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
ELLARIA: That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you.
OBERYN: Your loss.
OBERYN takes a drink.
OLYVAR: You like them both the same? Boys and girls?
OBERYN: Does that surprise you?
OLYVAR: Everyone has a preference.
OBERYN: Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides.
OLYVAR: I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
OBERYN: What are you, 25?
ELLARIA: Children.
OBERYN:  (CHUCKLES) Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day.
OLYVAR: Did you?
ELLARIA: He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
OBERYN: They will all have to line up behind you.
A door opens. TYWIN enters.
TYWIN:  Prince Oberyn.
OBERYN: Lord Tywin.
TYWIN: May we have the room?
ELLARIA: Call my name if you need me, lover.
OLYVAR, MAREI, the WHORE and ELLARIA exit
OBERYN: Would you like to sit?
TYWIN: No, thank you.
OBERYN: Some wine?
TYWIN: No, thank you.
OBERYN dresses and pours some wine.
OBERYN:  I'm sorry about your grandson.
TYWIN: Are you?
OBERYN: I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.
TYWIN: Which way is that?
OBERYN: Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?
TYWIN: Some believe the king choked.
OBERYN: Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.
TYWIN: I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
OBERYN: I did. This is why I know.
TYWIN: Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning.
OBERYN: Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
TYWIN: You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
OBERYN: You think we conspired together?
TYWIN: What did you discuss?
OBERYN: The death of my sister.
TYWIN: For which you blame me.
OBERYN: She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.
TYWIN: Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?
OBERYN: You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.
TYWIN: Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
OBERYN: So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
TYWIN: Categorically.
OBERYN: I would like to speak with the Mountain.
TYWIN: I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
OBERYN: He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
TYWIN: I could arrange for this meeting.
OBERYN: But you want something in return.
TYWIN: There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third.
OBERYN: Why?
TYWIN: Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies.
OBERYN: Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.
TYWIN: I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
OBERYN: I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.
TYWIN: We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.
OBERYN: You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.
TYWIN: We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
OBERYN considers
INT. KING'S LANDING JAIL CELL
TYRION sits on the floor. The door unlocks and PODRICK enters.
TYRION: Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
PODRICK: I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me.
TYRION: A noble effort.
PODRICK: They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.
TYRION: You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
PODRICK: I've heard nothing, my lord.
TYRION: I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
PODRICK: You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
TYRION: Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
PODRICK: No, my lord. You didn't?
TYRION: No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?
PODRICK: Your father.
TYRION: Of course.
PODRICK: Mace Tyrell.
TYRION: Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
PODRICK: And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
TYRION: Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
PODRICK: I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf.
TYRION: Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa.
PODRICK: My lord, she's gone.
TYRION: Gone?
PODRICK: No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
TYRION: No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick.
PODRICK: Yes, my lord?
TYRION: They'll be following you now.
PODRICK: Who will?
TYRION: I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.
PODRICK: Any other witnesses, my lord?
TYRION: Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
PODRICK: He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
TYRION: Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
PODRICK: I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you.
TYRION: Why not?
PODRICK: They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
TYRION: And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
PODRICK: I'll ask, my lord.
PODRICK stands to go, but hesitates.
PODRICK: There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.
TYRION: Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
PODRICK: I didn't tell them anything, my lord.
TYRION: Are you going to accept their offer?
PODRICK: My lord.
TYRION: Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.
PODRICK: You've been good to me, my lord.
TYRION: Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that.
PODRICK: I already gave them an answer, my lord.
TYRION: I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.
PODRICK: My lord.
TYRION: Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell.
PODRICK: Farewell, my lord.
PODRICK nods and opens the door.
TYRION: Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
PODRICK bows his head as he exits.
EXT: THE NORTH
A bustling small village south of the wall. OLLY and GUYMON walk together
OLLY: Mother says it's time to eat.
GUYMON: What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.
OLLY: Potatoes.
GUYMON: Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got...
An arrow whistles through the air and pierces OLLY'S FATHER's neck. He falls dead. YGRITTE is the archer, and she is resolute and angry.
MAN: The wildlings!
OLLY'S MOTHER notices that GUYMON has fallen. She runs to him and OLLY. She finds him lifeless.
OLLY'S MOTHER: Guymon! (to OLLY) Hide. Hide!
OLLY runs as OLLY'S MOTHER cradles to body. The Thenns and wildlings attack, and she is hewn by the war axe of STYR. The Wildings take the village as OLLY runs for his life. TORMUND attacks brtutally with his sword. YGRITTE shoots down a villiager attacking him from behind. He falls, and TORMUND slits his throat. YGRITTE draws her sword and joins the melee
Meanwhile, OLLY hides under a wagon with some chickens. He watches YGRITTE, whimpering. Suddenly, he is pulled from behind, and a Thenn brings him to STYR.
STYR: You know how to get to Castle Black?
OLLY: Yes. Yes.
STYR puts OLLY over his shoulder and begins walking. He shows OLLY how the Thenns are butchering his parents.
STYR: Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
STYR releases him, and OLLY runs.
INT. CASTLE BLACK MAIN HALL
The rangers are gathered in the hall and YARWICK speaks. OLLY stands next to JON.
YARWYCK: We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
MEN: Aye! Aye!
YARWYCK: Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.
MEN: Aye!
ALLISER THORNE: If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want. They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time.
MAESTER AEMON: We have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.
PYP: There's got to be a way to protect them.
ALLISER THORNE: You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?
JON: Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them.
ALLISER THORNE: We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job.
A horn blows. (HORN BLOWS)
PYP: Rangers returning.
INT. THE GATE TO THE WALL
The heavy gate is opening, showing winter beyond. JON, PYP and the rangers help DOLOROUS EDD and GRENN.
JON: Help him.
DOLOROUS EDD: Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.
CUT TO: The courtyard.
JON helps DOLOROUS EDD and GRENN to the courtyard. ALLISER THORN and JANOS SLYNT walk up
ALLISER THORN: What took you so long?
GRENN: We were held up.
ALLISER THORN: By what?
GRENN: Chains.
DOLOROUS EDD: We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
JON: And the mutineers stayed?
DOLOROUS EDD: They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
JON: We need to ride north and kill them all.
ALLISER THORN: We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait.
JON:  It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.
PYP: I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
EXT: ESSOS
The unsullied march towards Meereen. DAENERYS, JORAH, SER BARRISTAN, MISSANDEI and DAARIO NAHARYS ride alongside. The riders dismount at the main gate while the unsullied stand at attention. The Meereen  citifolk watch from atop the walls.murmuring. The main door opens.
DAENERYS: Are they attacking?
JORAH: A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
A single rider advances, and the crowd cheers. He halts horse to the side of DAENERYS's band. He dismounts.
CHAMPION:  (SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
DAENERYS: What is he doing?
BARRISTAN SELMY: I believe he means to...
The CHAMPION urinates towards DAENERYS. The crowd laughs and cheers.
MISSANDEI: He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole.
BARRISTAN SELMY: Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words.
JORAH: They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
CHAMPION: (CONTINUES SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
DAENERYS: I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?
GREY WORM: (SPEAKING VALYRIAN) Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you.
DAEYNERYS: (valyrian) You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
BARRISTAN SELMY: Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive.
DAENERYS: Which is why you must remain by my side.
JORAH: I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well.
DAENERYS: You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life.
DAARIO: I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you.
DAENERYS: Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.
MISSANDEI: He is very brave, Your Grace.
DAENERYS: Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching.
A squire helps the mounted CHAMPION arm himself. DAENERYS walks up to DAARIO.
DAENERYS: You sure you don't want a horse?
DAARIO: Why would I want a horse?
DAENERYS: Horses are faster than men.
DAARIO: Horses are dumber than men.
DAENERYS steps back and the CHAMPION charges. DAARIO turns to wink at DAENERYS. The CHAMPION closes in and DAARIO draws his dagger, holds it on his shoulder and kisses it. He then launches it at the charging CHAMPION, burying the blade in his horse's forehead. The horse falls in the sand, the CHAMPION rolling away. As he rises, DAARIO dispatches him with a single blow to the neck. He nods to DAENERYS.
The Meeren crowd is shocked. An order is given, and scores of archers on the wall fire at DAENERYS's band. The arrows plant in front of them. DAARIO urinates in response. DAENERYS paces and the Unsullied turn at attention.
DAENERYS: (valyrian) I am Daenerys Stormborn.
The crowd quiets.
DAENERYS: (valyrian) Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you.
The Meereen inhabitants start to move away from the wall, while the Meereen soldiers face outside the wall. The Meereen slaves listen carefully to DAENERYS, while their masters become uncomfortable.
DAENERYS: Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!
The Unsullied move the seige weapons forward. The slaves are emboldened and the inhabitants are taken aback.
DAENERYS: Fire!
The unsullied fire the catapults. Cylindrical logs spin through the air and shatter on the sides of buildings, raining down the empty manacles inside. Civilians and slaves duck as the contents fall among them. A SLAVE picks up an empty choker and looks back at his fearful master.
EXT. MEEREEN AT NIGHT
A Tent outside of Meereen.
MISSANDEI is teaching GREY WORM how to read by a fire.
GREY WORM: My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer "Ills."
MISSANDEI: Isles. Summer Isles.
GREY WORM: Summer Isles. (speaks Valyrian)
MISSANDEI: (speaks Valyrian) I am from an island called Naath.
GREY WORM: (speaks Valyrian) When they took you?
MISSANDEI: "When did they take me?" I was five years old.
GREY WORM: You remember your home?
MISSANDEI: I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?
GREY WORM: (Shakes his head.) Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing.
MISSANDEI: That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
GREY WORM: I don't want return. (Speaks Valyrian.)
MISSANDEI: Kill the masters.
GREY WORM: Kill the masters.
DAENERYS and BARRISTAN SELMY enter. They stand
DAENERYS: How are the lessons coming?
MISSANDEI: Very well, Your Grace.
GREY WORM: Missandei is teacher good, my queen.
DAENERYS:  You'll have to continue later. It's time.
DAENERYS and BARRISTAN SELMY exit, followed by GREY WORM.
EXT. MEEREEN.
Overhead, the shadow of a flying dragon soars in the moonlight. On the ground, the Unsullied run through the rocky landscape. They strain to open a gate in the rockface. GREY WORM lights a torch as do the other Unsullied. They travel through the sewer tunnel.
CUT TO: Meereen slave's quarters.
Many slaves are gathered in the dark chamber, seating and standing.
MOSSADOR: (speaking Valyrian.) You heard her! She said she came to free us.
ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE:  (speaking Valyrian.)  You are a fool. The masters are too strong.
MOSSADOR: (speaking Valyrian.) She will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.
The slaves look at one another.
MOSSADOR: (speaking Valyrian.) She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
MEEREEN SLAVE:  (speaking Valyrian.) I want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?
ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE: (speaking Valyrian.) I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way: the Masters in power and the slaves dead.
GREY WORM and the Unsullied enter.
GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.)  All men must die.
The slaves are surprised to see them. ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE and MOSSADOR stand.
GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.) But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains.
ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE: (speaking Valyrian.) Who are you?
GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.) This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains.
ELDER MEEREEN SLAVE: (speaking Valyrian.) You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.
MEEREEN SLAVE:  (speaking Valyrian.) We have no training, weapons.
GREY WORM and the other Unsullied remove their bundles from around their shoulders. The weapons clank as they hit the ground. The salves gather round, and a few tentatively pick up some swords.
GREY WORM: (speaking Valyrian.) There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it.
EXT. Meereen streets at night
GREAT MASTER #1 and two guards  walk the empty streets. They encounter some grafitti reading "Kill the Masters."
GREAT MASTER #1: (Curses in Valyrian.)
They look up to a high tower where a Targaryen flag is waving. Suddenly, a mob of slaves comes running at them. The guards run, leaving GREAT MASTER #1 to his own devices. He tries to flee, but more slaves pour around each corner. The slaves shout and set upon him.
EXT. Meereen streets at day
DAENERYS walks among the cheering slaves, flanked by children.
SLAVES: Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
DAENERYS, JORAH and BARRISTAN SELMY walk down the steps on the cliff, surrounded by cheering slaves.
SLAVES: Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
They ascend to the overlook, joining GREY WORM and the Unsullied.
SLAVES: Mhysa! Mhysa!
DAENERYS: Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?
JORAH: 163, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS: Yes, that was it.
DAENERYS looks to GREY WORM, who gives a nod to  UNSULLIED #1.
UNSULLIED #1: (shouts in Valyrian.)
The Unsullied march forth, pressing the citizens of Meereen.
BARRISTAN SELMY: Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.
DAENERYS: I will answer injustice with justice.
CUT TO: The shores of Meeeen.
An Unsullied nails a Meereen citizen to a cross. Others scream. They line the path up the mountainside, each with one hand nailed to the post, pointing the way. The citizens watch. DAENERYS stands on a platform above, surveying the city, under the Targaryen flag. The screams echo.
EXT. King's Landing.
BRONN and JAIME spar by the sea. JAIME attacks and BRONN parries. JAIME pauses, panting and spins his sword. His skills have improved. They exchange attacks. BRONN presses JAIME, and they deadlock. BRONN grabs JAIME's golden hand and swats him across the face. JAIME falls to the ground.
JAIME: What the hell was that?
BRONN: That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
BRONN tosses JAIME back his hand.
JAIME: You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway.
BRONN: You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
JAIME: You talk to my brother this way?
BRONN: All the time. He got used to it.
They sit together on a low wall. JAIME drinks.
JAIME: Do you think he did it?
BRONN: No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?
JAIME doesn't answer.
BRONN: You haven't been to see him yet, eh?
JAIME: We're done for today.
He tosses the water skin to BRONN and starts to walk way
BRONN: Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
JAIME: You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
BRONN: Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
JAIME exits.
INT. Tyrion's cell
JAIME and TYRION sit in the cell.
JAIME: To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.
TYRION: Is that supposed to make me feel better?
JAIME: Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
TYRION: It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?
JAIME: How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
TYRION: Her son?
JAIME: Don't. You know what's coming?
TYRION: My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.
JAIME: Now that you mention it, she did ask.
TYRION: So, should I turn around and close my eyes?
JAIME: Depends. Did you do it?
TYRION: The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
JAIME: Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
TYRION: Well, you could set me free.
JAIME: You know I can't.
TYRION: Then there's really nothing else to say.
JAIME: What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
TYRION: Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.
JAIME: Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
TYRION: Except I didn't do it.
JAIME: Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my head's on a spike.
JAIME: Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
TYRION: Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
TYRION: No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway.
INT. Littlefinger's ship.
SANSA looks out on the ocean. Littlefinger enters.
SANSA: Where are you taking me?
LITTLEFINGER: I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
SANSA: Did you kill Joffrey?
LITTLEFINGER:Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
SANSA: I know it was you.
LITTLEFINGER: And who helped me with this conspiracy?
SANSA: Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king.
LITTLEFINGER: Why not?
SANSA: Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
LITTLEFINGER: Then perhaps it was your husband.
SANSA: No.
LITTLEFINGER: How do you know?
SANSA: I just do.
LITTLEFINGER: You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
SANSA: The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.
LITTLEFINGER: A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.
SANSA: I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?
LITTLEFINGER: So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
SANSA: And what do you want?
LITTLEFINGER: Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?
SANSA: Who could trust you?
LITTLEFINGER: I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.
EXT. King's Landing garden
OLENNA and MARGAERY stroll arm-in-arm in the garden.
MARGAERY: I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.
OLENNA: The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.
MARGAERY: (laughs)
OLENNA: Have you been to see Tommen yet?
MARGAERY: No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
OLENNA: I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.
MARGAERY: (laughs)
OLENNA:  How absentminded of me.
MARGAERY: Mm-hmm.
OLENNA: The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.
MARGAERY: (laughs)
OLENNA: And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.
MARGAERY: Well, he could have done.
OLENNA: He could have done,but he didn't.
MARGAERY: You don't know, Grandmother.
OLENNA: But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?
MARGAERY: What? I don't understand.
OLENNA: Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
EXT. Castle Black courtyard
Swords clang as the recruits train.
JON: Bring it through! And again.
JON and GRENN spar
JON: Very nice. Good.
JON and GRENN take a break. JON speaks to the recruits.
JON: A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
JON hands GRENN a second sword. They engage, and JON quickly knocks away one of GRENN's swords. GRENN takes a wide swing, JON ducks, then blocks his forearm and puts his blade to GRENN's throat. OLLY smiles in the crowd and GRENN nods, admitting defeat.
JON: Let's see what you can do.
OLLY steps forward, ready.
JON: Olly, you just watch for now.
OLLY: I can fight.
JON: Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
The recruits laugh.
OLLY: I was!
GRENN: I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn.
JON: You two. Take it slow,  try and disarm each other.
LOCKE and another ranger arm themselves. LOCKE bests the bald one.
JON: You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
LOCKE: He wouldn't have learned anything that way.
ALLISER THORNE and JANOS SLYNT enter.
ALLISER THORNE: Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?
JON: Grenn and I were helping them.
ALLISER THORN: Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't.
JON: Someone has to train them.
ALLISER THORNE: And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.
JON exits.
ALLISER THORNE: Get back to work. Now! I said now!
JANOS SLYNT: The bastard's well-liked.You're not.
ALLISER THORNE: You think I care if they like me? We're at war.
JANOS SLYNT:   For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
ALLISER THORNE exits.
CUT TO: the yard armory
JON returns his sword. RECRUIT joins him.
LOCKE: A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn.
JON: My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
LOCKE: Name's Locke.
JON: Jon Snow.
They shake.
JON: You fight well.
LOCKE: What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
ALLISER THORNE: Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?
LOCKE: Guess I was wrong.
INT. King's Landing, CERSEI's chamber.
There is a knocking at CERSEI's door. She drinks, ignoring it. JAIME enters.
JAIME: You sent for me, Your Grace?
CERSEI: Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
JAIME: Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
CERSEI: So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
JAIME: I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
CERSEI: The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
JAIME: What?
CERSEI:  I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
JAIME: You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
CERSEI: She hoped or did you promise?
JAIME: I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.
CERSEI: So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
JAIME: I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
CERSEI: You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?
JAIME: Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?
JAIME doesn't answer.
CERSEI: I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
JAIME: I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
CERSEI:  And?
JAIME: He didn't do it, Cersei.
CERSEI: You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander.
JAIME exits.
INT. Tommen's bedroom.
TOMMEN lies in his bed. He cannot sleep. He hears a door creaking
TOMMEN: Ser Pounce?
MARGAERY enters.
TOMMEN: How did you get past the Kingsguard?
MARGAERY: Kingsguard.
TOMMEN: I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
MARGAERY:  I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride.
MARGAERY sits on his bed.
MARGAERY: Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?
TOMMEN: Yes. But if my mother found out...
MARGAERY: It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace...
TOMMEN: Yes? Tell me a secret.
Sir Pounce jumps onto the bed. MARGAERY pets him
MARGAERY: Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
TOMMEN: That's Ser Pounce.
MARGAERY: Very handsome.
TOMMEN: Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
MARGAERY: That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.
TOMMEN: No. I don't think I am.
MARGAERY: That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?
TOMMEN: We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast.
MARGAERY: When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then.
MARGAERY leans in close.
MARGAERY:  Remember, our little secret.
She kisses TOMMEN on the forehead, and exits.
INT. King's Landing
BRIENNE and JAIME are looking at the history of the Kingsguard.
BRIENNE: "Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."
JAIME: It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
JAIME picks up a displayed sword, weighs it, and then hands it to BRIENNE. She takes it and admires it.
BRIENNE: Valyrian steel.
JAIME: Mmm. It's yours.
BRIENNE: I can't accept this.
JAIME: It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you.
JAIME reveals a suit of armor made for BRIENNE.
JAIME: I hope I got your measurements right.
BRIENNE: I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.
JAIME: I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
EXT. The forrest outside King's Landing
PODRICK beams next to JAIME. BRIENNE paces. BRONN stands in the background.
BRIENNE: I don't need a squire.
JAIME: Of course you do.
BRIENNE:  He'll slow me down.
JAIME: My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
PODRICK: I won't slow you down, ser... my lady. I promise I'll serve you well.
JAIME: See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
BRONN approaches and clasps PODRICK's shoulder. He unwraps a bundle.
BRONN: Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
He pushed the axe onto PODRICK's chest.
BRONN: What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse.
PODRICK exits
JAIME: They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
BRIENNE: Oathkeeper.
JAIME: Good-bye, Brienne.
BRIENNE nods and exits. JAIME watches her and PODRICK ride off.
PODRICK: Come on, move.
BRIENNE looks back at JAIME, and rides on.
INT. Castle black library at night.
SAM and JON converse in the library
SAM: I should neverhave taken her away.
JON: She wasn't safe here.
SAM: She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.
JON: Castle Black could be next.
SAM: I should go back for Gilly.
JON: We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
SAM: I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
JON: And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.
SAM: I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did.
JON: How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
SAM: I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
JON: The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
LOCKE enters
SAM: Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...
LOCKE: Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.
LOCKE exits
INT. Castle Black dining hall
ALLISER THORNE and JANOS SLINT sit at the main table.
ALLISER THORNE: Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only.
JON: Thank you, Ser Alliser.
JON moves down to the main floor of the hall.
JON: Ahem, brothers.
GRENN knocks against the table to get their attention. The hall quiets.
JON: I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?
GRENN stands. JON Nods. DOLOROUS EDD stands. Three more join, and then LOCKE does.
JON: I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
LOCKE: Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.
ALLISER THORNE: (nods)
JON: Thank you, brothers.
INT. Craster's Keep, night.
KARL TANNER drinks from a human skull while sounds of rough sex spill from the background.
WOMAN: No, don't. Don't, please.
WOMAN #2: Please don't. Ow! You're hurting me.
RAST pours himself some wine. He is drunk.
TANNER: Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
He spills wine from the skull into his mouth, greedily.
TANNER: Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?
A man rough arms one of Craster's wives into sexual submission. She wails.
TANNER: Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead.
TANNER pushes down another of Craster's wives. RAST admires the back of another.
TANNER: Rast.
RAST kisses her shoulder. TANNER grabs some meat and throws it at him.
TANNER: Go outside and feed the beast.
RAST: We should kill that thing.
TANNER: You should shuty our fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look likea fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutte rand soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me.
He stands.
TANNER: Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?
He kicks RAST gently
TANNER: Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?
He slaps RAST, goading him.  RAST; I wouldn't stand a chance. None of us would.
TANNER: I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight... any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards.
SISSY enters with CRASTER'S BABY.
TANNER: What the fuck is that?
SISSY: Craster's last child. A boy.
TANNER: What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.
TANNER pulls a knife.
TANNER: Don't need another mouth to feed. Hand him over.
SISSY: He didn't kill them. He offered them.
TANNER: To who?
SISSY: To the gods. The white walkers.
WOMEN: A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods.
TANNER: Shut up!
TANNER sheaths his knife and takes CRASTER'S BABY from SISSY.
TANNER: So... if it worked for him... Let's give the walkers what they want.
He brings CRASTER'S BABY to RAST.
TANNER: Rast is headed that way.
EXT. North of the Wall
RAST carries CRASTER'S BABY. He places the baby on the ground and walks away. CRASTER'S BABY starts to cry.
CUT TO: Craster's Keep.
RAST returns to the keep. Ghost growls in his cage. RASK opens a flask with his teeth.
RAST: Pink-eyed fuck. You thirsty?
He takes a drink. Ghost growls. RAST empties the flask in front of him. Ghost starts, and RAST falls back. After he stands, the birds sound and the snow cracks. RAST runs in terror.
RAST: Fuck!
CUT TO: Bran's camp
HODOR, BRAN, MEERA, JOJEN and Summer lay around the fire. CRASTER'S BABY's cries in the distance.
HODOR: Hodor.
BRAN: Do you hear that?
MEERA: Is that a baby?
JOJEN: It's coming.
BRAN: I'm going out there.
MEERA: No, we need to stay together.
BRAN: I'm going.
BRAN focusses inwards and his eyes turn white. Summer leaves the camp, inhabited by BRAN. He runs through the woods towards the cries of CRASTER'S BABY. Suddenly the ground gives way.
BRAN gasps and sits up.
JOJEN:  Bran. Bran.
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
MEERA: Bran, what happened?
BRAN: Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap.
MEERA: Who?
BRAN: I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost.
EXT. Craster's Keep, morning.
BRAN, MEERA, JOJEN and JODOR watch the bustle of the keep.
BRAN: They're Night's Watch. Look. Jon might be here.
MEERA: If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?
The rangers handle one of Craster's wives roughly.
MEERA: They might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore. We're not safe here.We need to go.
BRAN: No.
MEERA: Bran, we need to go now.
BRAN: I'm not leaving without Summer.
MEERA and JOJEN exchange a silent look.
MEERA: Can you remember where the cage was?
BRAN: The east side of the keep.
MEERA: If I'm not backsoon, we'll meet...
A Ranger smashes MEERA in the face, and she falls. BRAN and JOJEN react. HODOR stands.
HODOR: Hodor.
They are surrounded by Night's Watch traitors.
CUT TO: inside the keep.
The traitors yell and prod at HODOR, who is chained around his neck.
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
HODOR tries to undo his bonds. A traitor stabs him in the leg, and he groans, falling back.
HODOR: Hodor.
RAST: If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world.
CUT TO: Interior of the Keep
BRAN, MEERA and JOJEN are brought into the keep. BRAN falls to the ground when released.
TANNER: Help him up.
A traitor sits him up. TANNER comes over to BRAN, and fondles his furs.
TANNER: This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?
BRAN does not answer. TANNER rises and slaps him.
TANNER: You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?
TANNER strokes MEERA's hair and face.
TANNER: I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
TANNER releases MEERA.
TANNER: See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed.
JOJEN starts to spasm. He falls to the ground
RAST: What the fuck's wrong with him?
TANNER: Come here.
TANNER grabs MEERA by the hair and pulls her away from JOJEN. He puts a knife to her throat.
MEERA: (screams) No, please. Please.Please, let me help him.
TANNER:  Who are you?
MEERA: Please.
TANNER: Who are you?
BRAN:  I'm Brandon Stark! I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
RAST: It's Jon Snow's brother.
TANNER releases MEERA and walks over. MEERA runs to JOJEN.
MEERA: It's Meera. It's Meera.I'm right here.
TANNER: And I thought this was gonnabe another boring day.
MEERA: I'm right here.
EXT. North of the Wall.
A snow storm howls. A lone horseman appears. It is a WHITE WALKER, riding a dead horse. He holds CRASTER'S BABY. The horse walk across a frozen lake, towards an ominous landscape. Ice cracks as the WHITE WALKER brings the baby to  a stone circle with an altar in the middle. He places CRASTER'S BABY there. The NIGHT KING approaches from a line of white walkers. The NIGHT KING picks up the baby, and pierces his cheek with a long fingernail. The baby's eyes turn blue.
INT. King's Landing: The Iron Throne room
The HIGH SEPTON leads the coronation of TOMMEN. JAIME patrols in the back.
HIGH SEPTON: May the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times. May the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden. And may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead. In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name. King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Long may he reign!
ALL: Long may he reign!
The crowd cheers. TOMMEN bows.  MARGAERY and TOMMEN exchange a look.
HIGH SEPTON: Special day.
CUT TO: Later in the Sept
TOMMEN sits on the Iron Throne, with TYWIN beside him. A reception line moves towards him, including PYCELLE and VARYS.   (CROWD CHATTING)
PYCELLE: Your Grace.
VARYS: Your Grace.
TOMMEN exchanges nodes and smiles with MARGAERY, who stands in the wings.  CERSEI catches their gaze, and she comes to MARGAERY. The crowd greets her as she passes through.
MAN: Your Grace.
MAN #2:  Your Grace.
MARGAERY: Your Grace.
CERSEI: There he is.
MARGAERY:  Long may he reign.
CERSEI: Long may he reign.
MARGAERY:  He sits the throne like he was born to it.
CERSEI: Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?
MARGAERY: No, he wasn't.
CERSEI: You still mourn for Joffrey?
MARGAERY: He was my husband. My king.
CERSEI: He would have been your nightmare.
MARGAERY: Your Grace, I feel...
CERSEI: You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?
MARGAERY: No.
CERSEI: The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.
MARGAERY:  It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there.
CERSEI: He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
MARGAERY: He has you.
CERSEI: A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?
MARGAERY: Oh. After all that's happened... it sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it.
CERSEI: Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine.
LORAS bows to TOMMEN on the stage.
MARGAERY:  We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
CERSEI: (CHUCKLES)
MARGAERY: I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.
INT. Meereen council room, day
DAENERYS, BARRISTAN SELMY, DAARIO NAHARIS, JORAH, MISSANDEI AND GREY WORM are meeting.
JORAH: King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
BARRISTAN: And we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace.
DAARIO: The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.
DAENERYS: Who told you to take the Navy?
DAARIO: No one.
DAENERYS: So why did you do it?
DAARIO: I heard you liked ships.
DAENERYS: How many ships?
BARRISTAN: 93, Your Grace.
DAENERYS: How many men can they carry?
BARRISTAN: 9,300, not counting sailors.
DAENERYS: Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
JORAH: The Lannisters have more.
BARRISTAN: They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. 8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning.
JORAH: It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing. 10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.
BARRISTAN: The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
JORAH: The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.
JORAH stands.
JORAH: There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself "His Imperial Majesty."
DAENERYS: Please leave me. Not you, Jorah.
GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, DAARIO and BARRISTAN exit.
DAENERYS:  It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
JORAH: You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
DAENERYS: You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
JORAH: (CHUCKLES)
DAENERYS: How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
JORAH: You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
DAENERYS: I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.
JORAH: What, then?
DAENERYS: I will do what queens do. I will rule.
DAENERYS walks to the balcony.
EXT.  Outside the Aerie.
SANSA and LITTLEFINGER approach the Aerie.
LITTLEFINGER: Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.
SANSA: But how would they know?
LITTLEFINGER: You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
SANSA puts up her hood.
SANSA: Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
LITTLEFINGER: The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in 1,000 years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000.
KNIGHT: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
LITTLEFINGER: Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.
KNIGHT: Stand to.
KNIGHT #2: Stand to!
KNIGHT #3: Stand to!
KNIGHT: Welcome back, Lord Baelish.
The gate opens noisily, LITTLEFINGER and SANSA step through.
CUT TO: The Aerie throne room.
ROBIN sits on LYSA's lap on the throne. A door opens and LITTLEFINGER and SANSA enter. ROBIN runs down to greet him.
ROBIN: Uncle Petyr!
LITTLEFINGER: My lord.
They embace.
LITTLEFINGER: Oh. I have brought you a gift.
LITTLEFINGER gives ROBIN a glass bird.
LYSA: Lord Baelish.
LITTLEFINGER: My lady.
ROBIN: Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
LYSA descends to greet her visitors.
LYSA: A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
SANSA: It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al...
LYSA: Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me.
LYSA walks to SANSA, lowers her hood and caresses her face, smiling warmly. They hug.
LYSA: My flesh and blood.
SANSA: It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.
LYSA: You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
SANSA: Of course. I understand.
LYSA: No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
SANSA: I would never say a thing.
LYSA: The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.
ROBIN: Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
SANSA: They did, and my father's.
ROBIN: They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't.
SANSA: Make him fly?
ROBIN: Through the Moon Door.
He drops the glass bird through the moon door.
ROBIN: (GIGGLES)
LYSA: And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.
SANSA: They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
LYSA: I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
LYSA: Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin.
SANSA: It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.
LYSA: Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs.
LITTLEFINGER: Go. We'll speak soon.
ROBIN leads SANSA out by the hand. LYSA kisses LITTLEFINGER hungrily.
LYSA: What took you so long?
LITTLEFINGER: Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.
LYSA: She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
She kissed him.
LYSA: Let's get married tonight.
LITTLEFINGER: Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
LYSA: There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.
LITTLEFINGER: I do think that we could wait until...
LYSA: I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?
LITTLEFINGER: Like it was yesterday.
LYSA: What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters...
LITTLEFINGER kisses LYSA passionately to quiet her. She moans.
LITTLEFINGER: The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
LYSA: (nods)
LITTLEFINGER:  Tonight it is, then.
LYSA: (LAUGHS)
LITTLEFINGER:  Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.
LYSA opens the door and escorts in the septon.
LYSA: I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.
She kisses LITTLEFINGER
CUT TO: SANSA's room, at night
SANSA lies in bed. She can hear LYSA screaming and moaning in ecstacy. SANSA tries to ignore it.
INT. King's Landing, day
TYWIN and CERSEI meet in the Hand's residence.
TYWIN: When will the wedding take place in your mind?
CERSEI: As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
TYWIN:  A fortnight?
CERSEI: That seems reasonable.
TYWIN: No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals.
CERSEI: (shakes her head)
TYWIN: And your wedding to Loras?
CERSEI: Shortly after Tommen's.
TYWIN: Shortly?
CERSEI: A fortnight.
TYWIN: I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
CERSEI: We had that in common.
TYWIN: You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
CERSEI: Then whom can we trust?
TYWIN: Ourselves alone.
TYWIN rises and pours some wine, handing it to CERSEI. He then pours some for himself.
TYWIN:  The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
CERSEI: Robert wasn't particularly rich.
TYWIN: Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
CESEI: I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
TYWIN: Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
CERSEI: Haven't a clue.
TYWIN:  Go on, your best guess.
CERSEI: Pounds, tons, ounces?
TYWIN:  Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
CERSEI: That can't be.
TYWIN: Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
CERSEI: Then how do we pay for anything?
TYWIN: The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
CERSEI: How much?
TYWIN: A tremendous amount.
TYWIN sits.
CERSEI: There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.
TYWIN: The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
CERSEI: Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
TYWIN: And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.
CERSEI: It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do.
TYWIN: I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.
CERSEI: I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
She puts her wine down and stands.
CERSEI: The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
EXT. Westeros woods at night.
ARYA and the HOUND lie by their campfire.
ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
HOUND: Would you shut up?
ARYA: I can't sleep until I say the names.
HOUND: The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
ARYA: Only the ones I'm going to kill.
HOUND: (CHUCKLES) Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.
ARYA: If he were here right now, what would you do?
HOUND: I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.
ARYA: I'm almost done. Only one name left.
HOUND: Go on.
ARYA: The Hound.
INT. An Aerie dining room, night
LYSA serves SANSA a pastry
SANSA: Thank you.
LYSA: Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?
SANSA:  Really?
LYSA:  Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.
SANSA: My mother fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.
LYSA: This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?
SANSA eats another. LYSA takes her hand.
SANSA: They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
LYSA: Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder.
SANSA: Yes. I'm very lucky.
LYSA: He feels responsible for you.
SANSA: Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.
LYSA: Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
SANSA: Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much.
LYSA: Loved your mother.
SANSA: No.
LYSA: That's what you wanted to say.
SANSA: He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.
LYSA: Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?
SANSA: No.
LYSA holds SANSA's hands firmly and won't let go.
LYSA: He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?
SANSA: No, never.
LYSA: Are you pregnant?
SANSA: What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never...
LYSA: I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?
SANSA: Aunt Lysa, no, I...
LYSA: Your young, pretty body.
SANSA: Nothing. I'm a virgin.
LYSA: Don't lie to me.
SANSA: You're hurting me.
LYSA grips harder.
LYSA: I'll know if you lie.
SANSA: I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever.
LYSA stands up and hugs SANSA to her breast.
LYSA:  Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.
EXT. The Kingsroad.
BRIENNE and PODRICK ride the road. PODRICK struggles a bit.
BRIENNE: Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
PODRICK: Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters.
BRIENNE: Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.
PODRICK: That's a long way off.
BRIENNE:Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point.
PODRICK: Never, my lady. I'm your squire.
BRIENNE: I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.
PODRICK: All knights have squires, my lady.
BRIENNE: I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.
PODRICK: I swore an oath, my lady.
BRIENNE: I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.
PODRICK: I know.
BRIENNE: What do you think will happen if you leave?
PODRICK: They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
PODRICK's horse continues to squirm and whinny.
EXT. The camp of the HOUND and ARYA
The HOUND wakes, and notices that ARYA is gone. He panics, looking for her. Nearby, ARYA practices her agile footwork and swordwork with needle.
HOUND: The hell you doing?
ARYA: Practicing.
She continues to practice her steps.
HOUND: What, ways to die?
ARYA:  No one's going to kill me.
HOUND: They will if you Nance around like that. That's no way to fight.
ARYA: It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
HOUND: Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?
ARYA does a one-armed cartwheel.
ARYA: The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
HOUND:  Braavos. (SCOFFS) Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are.
ARYA: What do you know about anything?
HOUND: I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
ARYA: It was not.
HOUND: Was? He dead?
ARYA:  Yes.
HOUND: How?
ARYA: He was killed.
HOUND: Who by?
ARYA: Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn...
HOUND:  Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
ARYA:  He was outnumbered.
HOUND:  Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
ARYA: Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
HOUND:  The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? (LAUGHS) All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends.
ARYA stabs the HOUND in the gut as hard as she can, grunting. It doesn't pierce his armor. He backhands her, and she falls. He picks up Needle and threatens her with it.
HOUND: Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword. (SCOFFS)
The hound reverses the sword and hands it back to ARYA.
EXT. KIng's Landing garden.
OBERYN sits writing on a scroll. CERSEI enters, flanked by guards. He stands to greet her.
OBERYN: Your Grace.
CERSEI: Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
OBERYN:  A poem, actually.
CERSEI: May I show you the gardens?
OBERYN:  I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
CERSEI: No, you couldn't.
They walk through the gardens.
CERSEI: I didn't realize you were a poet.
OBERYN: Not a very good one.
CERSEI: For your paramour?
OBERYN: For one of my daughters.
CERSEI: You have several, don't you?
OBERYN: Eight.
CERSEI: Eight? Eight daughters?
OBERYN:  The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
CERSEI: Beautiful name.
OBERYN:  Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry.
CERSEI: Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?
OBERYN: Which joke is that?
CERSEI: You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
OBERYN: We can avenge them.
CERSEI: Yes, we can avenge them.
OBERYN: You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
CERSEI: I know he did.
OBERYN: We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
CERSEI: We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.
OBERYN: The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun.
CERSEI: I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
OBERYN: You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
CERSEI: Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again.
OBERYN: Anything at all.
CERSEI points to a sailing ship in the bay.
CERSEI: The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
OBERYN: I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
CERSEI: Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.
CERSEI exits.
EXT. The Kingsroad, day
PODRICK is roasting a rabbit. It catches fire.
PODRICK: Oh, no, no, no.
He picks up the spit but the rabbit is engulfed in flames.
PODRICK: No, no, no, no.
He drops the rabbit and stamps it out.
PODRICK: Hells. Gods.
BRIENNE returns with firewood.
BRIENNE: Did you remove the skin?
PODRICK: No, my lady.
BRIENNE: Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
PODRICK: No, my lady.
BRIENNE: Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
PODRICK: No, my lady. That was the cooks.
BRIENNE sits down, exasperated. She begins to remove her armor. PODRICK rushes over to help.
BRIENNE: What are you doing?
PODRICK: I'm helping you with your armor.
BRIENNE: I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much.
PODRICK backs away
BRIENNE: What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
PODRICK: I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.
BRIENNE: Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?
PODRICK: I killed a man.
BRIENNE: Who?
PODRICK: A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
BRIENNE: How did you kill a Kingsguard?
PODRICK: I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
BRIENNE starts to remove her armor straps again.
BRIENNE:  Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.
PODRICK gets up quickly to help.
EXT. Craster's Keep, evening.
RAST leads a WOMAN roughly away from the Keep. LOCKE is watching from behind a tree. RAST pushes the whimpering WOMAN down and laughs.
RAST: Hey. Hey, get up. Get up.
RAST grabs her shirt from behind and pulls her up. The WOMAN sobs. RAST pushes her forward.. They pass by LOCKE. A company of men emerges from the keep.
MAN: That's it lad, put it inside. Get the fire going again. We're all freezing.
MAN #2: Aye. What we need is a girl there.
MAN: I've got to have a piss.
LOCKE sneaks into the grounds.
MAN: Now keep quiet.
LOCKE creeps closer to the main keep, knocking a lantern as he passes, causing it to rattle and then squeak as it swings. He looks into the keep and sees the bound captives as well as some of the traitor rangers.
CUT TO: INT, Craster's Keep.
Within the keep, BRAN hears the squeaking, looks up and sees the swinging lantern. MEERA is also curious. JOJEN coughs
MEERA: You need water.
JOJEN: It doesn't matter.
MEERA: Of course it matters.
JOJEN: You mustn't let anything stop you.
BRAN: They already have stopped me.
JOJEN: No. You're not here. You're far from here.
MEERA: What does that mean?
JOJEN has a vision. The outer wall of the keep disappears, and behind the bound BRAN, the red leaves of a wierwood reaches out in the sunset.
JOJEN: At the hill. A great weirwood tree.
BRAN: You've seen it, too.
JOJEN: Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it.
BRAN: We will.
JOJEN: This... this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
MEERA: How... will we know the end?
JOJEN looks at his hand. In his vision, it is on fire.
JOJEN: You'll know.
CUT TO: Exterior, Craster's Keep
LOCKE moves stealthily through the woods. He arrives back at the ranger encampment.
LOCKE: Brothers.
JON, DOLOROUS EDD and GRENN step to meet him.
DOLOROUS EDD: You do move quiet.
JON: How many?
LOCKE: 11 men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.
GRENN: Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife.
LOCKE: Have you seen what I can do with a knife?
GRENN: (CHUCKLES) Not yet.
LOCKE: There's a hut on the West Side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.
JON: Why?
LOCKE: They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better.
GRENN: New moon tonight.
JON: (SIGHS) Get some rest. We move at sundown.
CUT TO: EXT Craster's Keep
The Keep grounds are lit by torches. A door opens brusquely. KARL and some rangers stride forth, heading to the main keep.
KARL: I've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left.
They enter the main building.
TANNER: Get her up.
Two rangers untie MEERA. She stuggles as they bring her to her feet. x
BRAN: Stop.
JOJEN: Stop. What are you doing?
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
BRAN: Stop. Stop!
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
The traitors raise MEERA's hands above her head to place them into manacles that hang from the beam above.
BRAN: Stop! Please.
HODOR: Hodor.
BRAN:  Please, get off her!
HODOR:  Hodor. Hodor.
MEERA has been put into the manacles, hands raised over her head. JOJEN watches.
BRAN: Please! Please, leave her alone!
BRAN: Please, stop. Stop.
They bind her feet as well.
BRAN: What are you doing? Leave her alone!
HODOR:  Hodor. Hodor.
BRAN: No!
KARL TANNER steps towards her.
KARL: Shh. Shh, shh, shh.
MEERA: (gasps)
KARL: Shh.
MEERA: (whimpers)
KARL touches her hair.
KARL: You've got pretty hair, don't you? Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh? You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you?
JOJEN: If you let my sister go, I can help you.
KARL: You can help me?
JOJEN: I can.
KARL:And how you gonna do that?
JOJEN: I have the sight. I can see things.
KARL: That's very helpful.
JOJEN: Things that haven't happened yet.
KARL: What a fine thing. A fine thing.
KARL kneels before JOJEN.
KARL: Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?
JOJEN: No.
KARL draws a knife.
KARL: Don't close your eyes.
KARL TANNER turns and stands, stepping back towards MEERA.
JOJEN: I saw you die tonight. I saw your body burn. I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.
MAN: To arms!
RAST enters.
RAST: They're here, the Night's Watch.
KARL TANNER exits.
CUT TO: Exterior of the Keep
The Night's Watch attack the camp, shouting and screaming. They engage with the traitors, battling with swords. GRENN, JON and LOCKE all dispatch their foes. LOCKE moves intently to the main keep.
CUT TO: Keep interior
LOCKE enters to find BRAN, HODOR, JOJEN and MEERA bound.
LOCKE: Rescue party is here, lads. Lady.
BRAN: Is Jon with you?
LOCKE: Aye. I'll take you to him.
LOCKE cuts BRAN's bonds.
LOCKE: You're Brandon Stark?
BRAN doesn't answer. LOCKE slices him with his knife, testing the feeling in his legs.
MEERA:  (GASPS)
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
LOCKE: The little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy.
BRON: Jon! Jon!
LOCKE covers BRAN's mouth with his gloved hand to silence him.
LOCKE: Keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats. Starting with the idiot. Do you hear? Do you hear?
CUT TO: Keep Exterior
The battle rages. The Night's Watch is winning
CUT TO: Keep Interior
BRAN sits silently. LOCKE unbinds him further.
HODOR: Hodor! Hodor! Hodor. Hodor.
LOCKE lifts him onto his shoulders.
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
BRAN's eyes turn white, as does HODOR's. HODOR rocks methodically, pulling his chains free from the wall.
CUT TO: Keep Exterior
Jon and the rangers continue to battle against the traitors. JON dispatches man after man.
CUT TO: The woods just beyond the keep
LOCKE carries BRAN, trudging through the woods. HODOR appears and knocks BRAN from LOCKE's shoulder. Both BRAN and HODOR have white eyes: BRAN is in control of the giant. HODOR holds LOCKE above him with one had around his neck. LOCKE chokes and strains. HODOR twists his hand quickly, spanning LOCKE's neck. HODOR drops the lifeless body.
BRAN: Hodor. Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose.
HODOR is dsazed, confused.
BRAN: Hodor, get his knife. Hodor. Cut me loose, Hodor.
HODOR picks up the knife and cuts BRAN's bonds.
BRAN: Jojen and Meera, free them. Go!
HODOR exits. BRAN can hear the sounds of the battle.
BRAN: Jon.
CUT TO: Keep Exterior
JON fights relentlessly. BRAN crawls closer to the camp.
BRAN: Jon!
JON doesn't hear him in the noise of the battle. JOJEN appears.
JOJEN: If he sees you, he won't let you go north.
BRAN:  He's my brother.
JOJEN: And wants to protect you. He'll take you back to Castle Black.
BRAN watches JON at battle.
JOJEN: You have to decide. Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?
BRAN considers. He watches JON from afar. BRAN makes up his mind.
BRAN: Hodor.
HODOR: Hodor.
BRAN: We need to free Summer. And we need to go.
JOJEN and HODOR help him up.
CUT TO: Keep interior
KARL TANNER stabs a Night's Watchman in the neck. JON enters. KARL TANNER pulls his knife back and bows.
KARL TANNER: Lord Snow. Are you bringing me back for trial?
KARL TANNER spins his knives and walks towards Jon.
KARL TANNER: We had a good thing here. We were free men. You'll never be free. You'll never know what that's like.
They battle, JON's sword against KARL TANNER's knives. It is an even match. They pause for breath.
KARL TANNER: You learn how to fight in a castle?
They engage again. KARL TANNER gets the upper hand and stabs JON in the leg. JON groans.
KARL TANNER: Some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?
JON frees himself from the dagger and they battle again. KARL TANNER has the upper hand.
KARL TANNER: How to fight with honor?
JON slices KARL TANNER's face, who falls back. They grapple and parry.
KARL TANNER: You know what's wrong with honor?
KARL TANNER spits in JON's face, then sweeps his legs from under him. JON falls and KARL TANNER kicks at him, then stomps on JON's hand to prevent him from grabbing his sword. A stabbing sounds, and KARL TANNER drops his knifes and stumbles backward. SISSY has put a knife in his back. She looks terrified.
KARL TANNER: You.
KARL TANNER reaches back to remove the knife, while walking towards SISSY. She backs away and falls, and KARL TANNER successfully dislodges the knife. He menaces her with it. Suddenly, JON's sword pieces through KARL TANNER's mouth. JON slowly withdraws his bloody blade. KARL TANNER falls dead atop SISSY. JON kneels down to her.
JON: Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.
CUT TO: EXT, Craster's Keep
GRENN slays a traitor. JON and SISSY emerge from the building. DOLOROUS EDD drags LOCKE's body to the others. SISSY runs to MORAG and others of Craster's wives.
JON: We lost four brothers?
DOLOROUD EDD: Five.
They look down at LOCKE. His neck it grotesquely twisted.
GRENN: What the seven hells could do that to a man?
JON: I count 10 dead mutineers.
GRENN: Locke said there were 11 of them.
DOLROUS EDD: Where's Rast?
CUT TO: The woods outside the Keep
RAST runs through the woods. He passes by the cages where the wolves had been penned. They are open. He looks about, and Ghost lunges on top of him. RAST screams.
CUT TO: EXT, Craster's Keep
GRENN, JON and a Night's Watchman survey the grounds. The MAN hands JON a sword.
MAN: Here's another.
GRENN: Jon.
Ghost approaches.
JON: Where in seven hells? Come here.
Ghost whines. JON pets him.
JON: I missed you, boy.
DOLOROUS EDD: What should we do with this lot?
JON: It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.
MORAG: Meaning all respect, Ser Crow, Craster beat us and worse. Your brother crows beat us and worse. We'll find our own way.
JON: You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?
MORAG spits.
MORAG: Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.
CUT TO: The Keep Burning.
JON, DOLOROUS EDD and GRENN watch the keep burn. So do MORAG, SISSY and the remaining wives. The building begins to collapse.
EXT: The sea outside Braavos.
STANNIS and DAVOS ride a Baratheon ship through the legs of a massive statue of a Colossus.
INT: Opulent Braavos chamber
STANNIS and DAVOS wait, pacing anxiously.
DAVOS: Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--
STANNIS: We've been here since midday.
DAVOS: Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--
The door opens. TYCHO NESTORIS and two other Iron bankers enter and sit.
TYCHO: Welcome to the Iron Bank. Please, sit.
STANNIS ponders, then sits.
TYCHO: What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?
DAVOS: This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
TYCHO motions for DAVOS to sit. He does.
TYCHO: The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
STANNIS: He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.
TYCHO: Yes, we have heard this story.
STANNIS: It's not a story. It's the truth.
TYCHO: The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
STANNIS: Gold you loaned him.
TYCHO: And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
STANNIS: More than any man living.
TYCHO: Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like "usurper" and "madman" and "blood right." Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?
STANNIS: 4,000.
TYCHO: And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
DAVOS: 32.
TYCHO: And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?
STANNIS: None.
TYCHO: You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
STANNIS stands to leave. DAVOS rises as well.
DAVOS: My lord.
TYCHO: I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.
DAVOS: Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another.  {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers.
DAVOS: This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.
TYCHO: The war is over.
DAVOS: As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?
TYCHO: Ser Davos...
DAVOS: Humor me.
TYCHO:  Tywin Lannister.
DAV OS: How old is Tywin Lannister?
TYCHO:  67.
STANNIS: 67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?
TYCHO: That is a problem for another time.
DAVOS: Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.
DAVOS displays his hand as proof.
INT: Braavosi bathhouse.
SALLADOR SAAN  sits in a bath with two prostitutes.
SALLADOR: The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. The captain shouts to his first mate, "Bring me my red shirt." The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on. And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory. A few days later, the lookout screams, "Two pirate ships!" The crew is shivering like scared mice. But the courageous captain hollers, "Bring me my red shirt!"
DAVOS enters.
SALLADOR: After the battle, the first mate asks, "Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?" The captain replies, "So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed." The next morning the lookout screams, "10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!" The crew goes silent.
DAVOS sits beside the bath, indulging SALLADOR..
SALLADOR: They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command. Calm as ever, the captain bellows...
WOMEN: "Bring me my brown pants!"
DAVOS: You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?
SALLADOR: Davos. I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
DAVOS: Only half rotted.
SALLADOR and DAVOS clasp hands and laugh.
SALLADOR: Join us, my friend. Join us. This is Lhara. And this is--
LHARA:  I am Lhara.
SALLADOR slaps her playfully and LHARA squeals.
SALLADOR: She's an artist, this one, truly.
DAVOS: No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.
SALLADOR: We?
SALLADOR: Once I thought this man loved me. Now I know he despises me. He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold--
DAVOS throws down a weighty purse. SALLADOR opens it and begins counting.
DAVOS: You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.
SALLADOR sighs in resignation.
DAVOS: There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.
The women laugh.
SALLADOR: You're not my friend, my friend.
DAVOS: (laughs) I'll see you at sunrise.
EXT: An Ironborn ship at sea.
YARA addresses the Ironborn.
While YARA reads the letter in voice over, RAMSAY and MYRANDA aggressively having sex.
MYRANDA: Yes!
YARA's voice over continues, as she and the Ironborn row in darkness.
YARA: They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince. Your prince.  Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you.
CUT TO: MYRANDA and RAMSAY
MYRANDA: Yes! Yes!
YARA: As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word ironborn means nothing.
EXT: The waters outside the Dreadfort
Three Ironborn skiffs row towards  the Dreadfort
INT: RAMSAY's bedroom
MYRANDA and RAMSAY are still at it. MYRANDA moans.
EXT: the Dreadfort castle wall.
A grappling hook sails onto the rampart. A GUARD walks over to investigate, and receives a battle axe to the forehead. Yara comes over the wall, followeds by more ironborn raiders.
FIRST MATE: Go left.
The Ironborn clash with the Bolton guards. YARA takes one hostage.
YARA:  Theon Greyjoy.
BOLTON GUARD:  I don't know--
YARA: I'm here for Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons.
BOLTON GUARD: He's not in the dungeons.
CUT TO: The kennel.
Many dogs sit in cages. The FIRST MATE comes down the steps bearing a torch, followed by YARA and her hostage BOLTON GUARD.
BOLTON GUARD: Last cage on the right.
YARA: Thank you.
She slits his throat and takes the torch from the IRONBORN. She walks into the kennel and the dogs start barking
YARA: This way!
She finds THEON, who recoils in fear. She opens his cage.
YARA: We're going home.
THEON: No!
YARA: It's all right. It's me, Yara.
THEON: You can't trick me. Tell him. Tell him you couldn't trick me.
YARA: I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you.
THEON:  Not Theon! Reek! Reek! My name is Reek!
FIRST MATE:  They're here.
YARA: If they catch us in here, we're trapped. Help me with him.
YARA and her FIRST MATE grab at THEON, trying to pull him out of the cage. The dogs bark.
THEON: No, you can't! You can't!
YARA: You're Theon Greyjoy.
THEON: No, I don't believe her! I know who I am! I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek! Good Reek! I've always been Reek!
RAMSEY enters with some Bolton guards, covered in bloody scratch marks as the dogs continue to bark. The FIRST MATE silences THEON. The Ironborn soldiers take a defensive position in front of THEON, YARA and the FIRST MATE.
RAMSAY: This is turning into a lovely evening.
RAMSAY charges and the Ironborn and Bolton engage in battle. The dogs bark and snarl in thier cages. RAMSAY fights effectively with his daggers.
THEON: I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!
The FIRST MATE covers THEON's mouth once more.
YARA grapples with a Bolton guard, who bites her hand.
YARA: Aah! Theon!
THEON runs back into his cage, terrified. YARA quickly dispatches three guards and faces RAMSAY, panting.
YARA: Give me my brother and no more of your men will die.
RAMSAY:  You've got bigger balls than he ever did. But with those big balls of yours...
RAMSAY produces a large key.
RAMSAY: how fast can you run?
RAMSAY opens the cage.
EXT: the shore
YARA and the ironborn return to their skiff
YARA: Make for the ship, now.
IRONBORN: But your brother.
YARA: My brother is dead.
INT: The Dreadfort, morning.
RAMSAY runs his hand through a warm bath. THEON stands in the background, meekly.
RAMSAY: I have a treat for you. A reward.
THEON: Reward?
RAMSAY: Yes, Reek. Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away. And you didn't let them. You remained loyal.
RAMSAY stands and walks to THEON.
RAMSAY:  Yes, yes, Reek. It's a bath. For you. Remove those rags. Now.
THEON removes his shirt. His torso is covered with scars.
RAMSAY: The britches, too, Reek. Take them off.
THEON removes his pants. RAMSAY points him to the bath, and he gets in, clumsily and warily. RAMSAY sits on the lip of the tub. He takes a sponge and begins to wash Theon.
THEON: (gasps)
RAMSAY: Do you love me, Reek?
THEON: Yes, of course, my lord.
RAMSAY: Good. Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important. There's a castle, you see. Some bad men hold this castle. I need your help to take this castle back.
THEON: But how can--
RAMSAY: I need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not.
THEON: Pretend to be who?
RAMSAY: Theon Greyjoy.
EXT: Goat Field near Meereen.
A GOATHERD and GOATHERD'S SON tend their flock. The GOATHERD'S SON throws stones in the river to amuse himself. He looks down, and suddenly Drogon flies overhead. He spits fire and takes a goat and flies off, screeching
INT: Meereen throne room.
The GOATHERD stands before DAENERYS. JORAH, BARRISTAN SELMY and MISSANDEI stand with her, while GREY WORM stands guard.
DAENERYS: (speaking Valyrian) You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don't be afraid, my friend.
The GOATHERD stands motionless, head bowed.
MISSANDEI: The Queen says you may approach and speak.
The GOATHERD steps forward and ascends the stairs.
GOATHERD: (speaks Valyrian).
MISSANDEI: He is a goatherd. He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.
DAENERYS: I thank him for his prayers.
MISSANDEI: (speaks Valyrian)
The GOATHERD places his bundle on the ground and reveals the charred of his goat.
GOATHERD: (speaks Valyrian).
MISSANDEI: It was your dragons, he says. They came this morning for his flock.
GOATHERD: (speaks Valyrian).
MISSANDEI: He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing.
DAENERYS: Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats,
MISSANDEI: (translates)
DAENERYS:  but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
GOATHERD: (speaks Valyrian, excitedly thanking her).
The GOATHERD gathers his bundle and exits. DAENERYS is pleased.
DAENERYS: Send the next one in.
HIZDAHR ZO LORAQ and his MANSERVANT enters.
MANSERVANT: (Speaking Valyrian) The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen.
DAENERYS: (Speaking Valyrian) The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.
The MANSERVANT retreats and HIZDAHR comes forward and bows.
HIZDAHR: Queen Daenerys. Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.
DAENERYS: I thank you.
HIZDAHR: Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.
DAENERYS: Then it is my honor to receive you.
HIZDAHR: My father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks. This pyramid included.
DAENERYS: For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him.
HIZDAHR: You have, Your Grace. You crucified him. I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.
DAENERYS: Your father crucified innocent children.
HIZDAHR: My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?
DAENERYS: I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that.
HIZDAHR: What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
DAENERYS: And what traditions do you speak of?
HIZDAHR: The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.
HIZDAHR kneels.
HIZDAHR: Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials.
DAENERYS: And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
HIZDAHR: Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world.
DAENERYS: Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.
HIZDAHR: Thank you, my queen.
HIZDAHR exits with his MANSERVANT
DAENERYS: How many more?
MISSANDEI: There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace.
DAENERYS:  212?
She looks to JORAH, who shrugs.
DAENERYS: Send the next one in.
INT: King's Landing Small Council room.
OBERYN meets with CERSEI, VARYS, MACE TYRELL and PYCELLE.
OBERYN: These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?
MACE: Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you--
TYWIN enters and everyone rises, save OBERYN. TYWIN sits and the head of the table.
MACE: Lord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I--
Everyone sits.
TYWIN: The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?
VARYS: Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.
CERSEI: A coward and a traitor.
VARYS: My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase "fuck the king" was uttered.
PYCELLE: Disgraceful.
TYWIN: What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
VARYS: 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
TYWIN: Make it 100. What else?
VARYS: More whispers from the east, my lord.
TYWIN: The Targaryen girl?
VARYS: Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
CERSEI: Conquered with what?
CERSEI: Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace.
PYCELLE: Mormont is spying on her for us.
VARYS: No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.
CERSEI: He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
TYWIN: Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
CERSEI: Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
VARYS: A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.
OBERYN: Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.
TYWIN: Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.
PYCELLE: How, my lord? By force?
TYWIN: Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?
VARYS: Most certainly, my Lord Hand.
TYWIN: Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper.
MACE stands to retrieve them, and exits.
INT: The Iron Throne room
VARYS: Prince Oberyn.
OBERYN: Lord Varys...
VARYS: Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
OBERYN: And yet everyone does.
VARYS: You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
OBERYN: Five years.
VARYS: May I ask why?
OBERYN: 'Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
VARYS: Most of us aren't princes.
OBERYN: You are from Essos. Where? Lys?
VARYS: I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
OBERYN: I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?
VARYS: It's a long story.
OBERYN: One you don't like telling people.
VARYS: People I trust.
OBERYN: My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but...
VARYS doesn't answer.
OBERYN: You did like boys before?
VARYS: (shakes his head)
OBERYN:  Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
VARYS: Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either.
OBERYN:  What then?
VARYS:  Nothing.
OBERYN: Everybody is interested in something.
VARYS: Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.
OBERYN: Such as?
VARYS doesn't answer, but looks over to the throne instead. He exits.  OBERYN ponders.
INT: TYRION's cell
JAIME peeks through the window of the cell. TYRION sits on his bed. JAIME asks the guard to open the door, then enters the cell.
TYRION: Let me guess, I've been pardoned.
JAIME nods an order to the guards behind him. They put him in manacles.
TYRION: Really?
JAIME: Father's orders.
TYRION: Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.
INT: King's Landing,  the Iron Throne room
A door opens, and JAIME and TYRION enter. TYRION walks down the aisle through the crowd,  flanked by two guards.
MAN: Kingslayer!
TOMMEN sits on the Iron Throne, TYWIN at his side. TYRION Is led to the accused dais, where his wrists are freed. JAIME steps away, as do the guards. OBERYN and MACE TYRELL stand just to the right of the Iron Throne. TYRION takes measure of the room.
TYWIN motions to TOMMEN, who rises in response. Everyone in the hall does as well, including MARGAERY, LORAS and CERSEI.
TOMMEN: I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty... may the gods punish the accused.
TOMMEN exits, walking past both TYRION and JAIME. OBERYN and MACE TYRELL join TYWIN on the main platform. Everyone sits, save TYRION.
TYWIN: Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?
TYRION: No.
TYWIN: Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?
TYRION: Not that I know of.
TYWIN: How would you say he died, then?
TYRION: Choked on his pigeon pie.
TYWIN: So you would blame the bakers?
TYRION: Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
TWYIN: The crown may call its first witness.
CUT TO: The throne room, a bit later.
MERYN TRANT is on the stand.
MERYN TRANT: Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed.
TYRION: Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?
TYWIN: Silence.
TYRION: Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
TYWIN: Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.
MERYN TRANT exits, eyeing TYRION on his way out.
CUT TO: The throne room, a bit later.
PYCELLE is on the stand.
PYCELLE: Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance... blind eye--
OBERYN: I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store.
PYCELLE: Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered.
TYWIN: By whom?
PYCELLE: By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.
TYWIN: Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?
PYCELLE: Without question.
The crowd murmurs. PYCELLE removes a necklace from his sleeve.
PYCELLE: This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside.
TYWIN: Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
PYELLE: It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
The crowd murmurs.
CUT TO: The throne room, a bit later.
CERSEI is on the stand.
CERSEI: "I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid."
MACE: Your own brother said this to you?
CERSEI: (Nods.) Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops.
OBERYN: Tyrion said, "And you will know the debt is paid." What debt?
CERSEI: I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
TYRION: (shakes his head)
TYWIN: Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.
MARGAERY sighs. CERSEI leaves the witness stand. JAIME watches her return to her seat, and their eyes lock.
CUT TO: The throne room, a bit later.
VARYS is on the stand.
MACE: Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
VARYS: I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, "Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
MACE: And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
VARYS: Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
The crowd murmurs.
TWYIN: You're excused, Lord Varys.
VARYS nods and leaves the stand.
TYRION: Father, may I ask the witness one question?
TYWIN: One.
TYRION: You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?
VARYS: Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing.
VARYS bows and exits. TYRION watches him go.
TYWIN: We will adjourn for now.
TYWIN, OBERYN and MACE stand.
TYWIN: Toll the bells in an hour's time.
GUARD: Clear the court!
The crowd stands.
JAIME and CERSEI look at one another. The crowd files out and TYRION sits, dejected.
INT; Tywin's chambers.
TYWIN sits eating. JAIME stands.
JAIME: You'd condemn your own son to death?
TYWIN: I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
JAIME: This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
TYWIN: I know nothing of the sort.
JAIME:  You've always hated Tyrion.
TYWIN: He killed his king.
JAIME: As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
TYWIN:  It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
JAIME:  Justice?
TYWIN: I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.
JAIME: He'll be executed.
TYWIN:  No, he'll be punished accordingly.
JAIME: Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.
TYWIN: I'm well aware of your oath.
JAIME: What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
TYWIN: What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
JAIME: It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
TYWIN: Done.
JAIME is speechless.
TYWIN: When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again.
JAIME: You have my word.
TYWIN: And you have mine.
A bell tolls and JAIME exits. TYWIN drinks.  --
INT: The Iron Throne room
The crowd assembles once again. JAIME enters and walks over to TYRION, who sits in the accused box.
TYRION: Not going well, is it?
JAIME: You're going to be found guilty.
TYRION: Oh, you think so?
JAIME: When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.
TYRIOM: Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
CERSEI enters. She watches her brothers whispering.
JAIME: Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
YTRION: How do you know?
TYWIN, OBERYN and MACE enter and the crowd stands.
JAIME: Do you trust me?
TYRION: (nods)
JAIME: Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
The crowd sits and JAIME takes his place.
TYWIN: The crown may call its next witness.
There are footsteps. TYRION turns and is shocked to see SHAE enter. She enters the witness box, looking down.
TYWIN: State your name.
SHAE: Shae.
TYWIN: Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
SHAE: I swear it.
TYWIN: Do you know this man?
SHAE looks at TYRION.
SHAE: Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
TYWIN: How do you know him?
SHAE: I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
TYWIN: This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
SHAE: I know that he's guilty.
The crowd gasps.
SHAE: He and Sansa planned it together.
The crowd murmurs.
TYWIN: Silence! Continue.
TYRION sits, shocked.
SHAE: She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord.
The crowd murmurs.
SHAE: He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
OBERYN: How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
SHAE: I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
The crowd murmurs.
MACE: I beg your pardon? You said you were his...
SHAE: His whore.
TYWIN: How did you come to be in his service?
SHAE: He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. "You belong to me now," he said. "I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."
The crowd laughs.
TYWIN: Silence. Silence!
OBERYN: And did you?
SHAE: Did I what?
OBERYN: Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
SHAE: I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him "my lion," so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, "I am yours and you are mine."
TYRION: Shae. Please don't.
SHAE: I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.
The crowd clamors.
TYRION: Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess.
JAIME is shocked.
TYWIN: You wish to confess?
TYRION turns to the crowd.
TYRION: I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
The crowd clamors.
TYWIN: Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
TYRION: Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?
TYWIN: You admit you poisoned the king?
TYRION: No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf.
TYWIN: You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
TYRION: Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life.
TYWIN: Have you nothing to say in your defense?
TYRION: (To Cersei) Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.
TYRION: (To the crowd) I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
TYWIN: Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
TYRION: I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
The crowd clamors.
INT. King's Landing, Tyrion's Cell, day
JAIME and TYRION stand in the jail cell.
JAIME: I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
TYRION: I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?
JAIME: You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?
JAIME: You fell in love with a whore.
TYRION: Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.
JAIME: Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
TYRION: At least I got to tell them what they really are.
JAIME: Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride.
TYRION: Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.
JAIME: I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
TYRION: Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.
JAIME: (laughs)
TYRION: Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
JAIME: It is tempting.
TYRION: Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.
JAIME: If he wins.
TYRION: Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
JAIME: No. Not Ser Meryn.
EXT. King's Landing battle pit, day
The MOUNTAIN gores a prisoner on his great sword, heaving him mightily into the air. Blood streams from his mouth as the MOUNTAIN discards his body onto the sand. CERSEI watches. A line of filthy prisoners wait for a similar fate, a pair of guards behind them. A GUARD pushes the next PRISONER forward.
GUARD: Go on, move it.
The GUARD pushes PRISONER #2 forward. They reach
GUARD: And you. Come on.
The prisoners reach down to pick up meager weapons. PRISONER #1 attacks the MOUNTAIN, who parries and then disembowels him with a single blow. He takes a step forward. PRISONER #2 throws down his weapon and drops to his knees. The line of prisoners panics and the guards work to contain them.
PRISONER #2: Mercy. Please. Please, mercy.
CERSEI enters as the MOUNTAIN dispatches PRISONER #2 with a series of overhead blows.
CERSEI: Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
CERSEI looks down.
CERSEI: You seem to be in good form.
MOUNTAIN: Who am I fighting?
CERSEI: Does it matter?
MOUNTAIN: (Shakes his head.)
EXT. The Riverlands.
ARYA and the HOUND ride up to a smoldering farm.
HOUND: Could be food.
ARYA: Could be soldiers.
ARYA and the HOUND dismount and explore the farm. They come upon a DYING MAN, who sits propped up with a gut wound.
ARYA: You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
DYING MAN: Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down.
HOUND: Who were "they"?
DYING MAN: I stopped asking a while ago.
The HOUND kneels down to inspect his wound.
HOUND: That's not gonna get better.
DYING MAN: Doesn't seem so.
HOUND: A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?
DYING MAN: Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.
ARYA kneels.
ARYA: So why go on?
DYING MAN: Habit.
ARYA: Nothing could be worse than this.
DYING MAN: Maybe nothing is worse than this.
ARYA: Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
DYING MAN: Who are you?
ARYA: My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
DYING MAN: You her father?
HOUND: (Shakes his head.) Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
DYING MAN: A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work.
The HOUND gives him a drink of water.
DYING MAN: Wish it were wine.
HOUND: So do I.
The HOUND stabs the DYING MAN in the heart. He dies. The HOUND wipes the blood from his knife on the man's arm.
HOUND: That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.
Suddenly, BITER jumps onto the the HOUND's back, shouting and biting his neck. The HOUND throws BITER down, breaking his neck in the process. He turns to see RORGE, weapon drawn.
HOUND: The fuck you doing?
RORGE: There's a price on your head.
HOUND: Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
RORGE: The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.
HOUND: And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?
ARYA: You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
HOUND: This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?
ARYA: He can't be. I don't know his name.
HOUND: What's your name?
RORGE:  Rorge.
ARYA: Thank you.
ARYA draws needle quickly and pierces RORGE in the heart. He groans and falls. ARYA wipes her sword clean on his body.
HOUND: You're learning.
EXT. Castle Black courtyard.
The rangers train in the yard.  A horn blows
MAN: Rangers returning!
MAN #2: They return!
JON, GRENN, DOLOROUS EDD and their party enter. The men in the yard greet them, including SAM.
MAN #2: Rangers returning!
JON: Greetings.
MAN #3: Didn't think I'd see you again.
JON and SAM hug.
SAM: All right, Jon?
MAN #4: Welcome back, brother.
ALLISER THORNE and JANOS SLYNT enter on the platform above.
ALLISER: Lord Snow.
JON finishes greeting OLLY. They all look up. Ghost barks.
ALLISER: This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
JON turns and walks away
JON: Come on, Ghost.
INT. Castle Black Hall.
The Night's Watch is gathered for a meeting. From the floor, JON addresses ALLISER THRONE who sits at the elevated table with JANOS SLYNT. First builder YARWICK also sits at the head table.
JON: Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
JANOS SLYNT: I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?
JON: We need to prepare.
ALLISER: We've been preparing.
JON: We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
ALLISER: And how would we range north?
JON: We wouldn't.
ALLISER: Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?
GRENN: We can't defend the gate against 100,000 men.
ALLISER: This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.
JON: Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have.
ALLISER: The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.
JON: They won't stop them.
ALLISER: Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.
JON: The stewards.
ALLISER: Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
JON: No.
ALLISER: Who would that be?
JON: The builders.
ALLISER:Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?
YARWICK: (Pauses.) No.
ALLISER: Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon.
The room laughs.
ALLISER: Moving on. First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall.
YARWICK: Aye.
JON sits in frustration.
INT. TYRION's cell.
TYRION sits and looks out the window. A door opens beyond his cell. BRONN walks down the stairs and is let into the cell.
BRONN: My lord.
TYRION: You have new clothes.
BRONN:  Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
TYRION: I sent for you days ago.
BRONN:  I've been a bit busy.
TYRION: Doing what?
BRONN: My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
TYRION: Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
BRONN: I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
TYRION: She's dim-witted.
BRONN: If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.
TYRION: When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?
BRONN: Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister.
TYRION: And you understand the rules of inheritance?
BRONN: Falyse is 40 and barren.
TYRION: She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
BRONN: She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
TYRION: (scoffs.)
BRONN: What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
TYRION: You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
BRONN sits.
BRONN: You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.
TYRION: Is it two wives you want or two castles?
BRONN: One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.
TYRION: I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
BRONN: I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
TYRION: You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
BRONN: Your sister's a Lannister, too.
TYRION: My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it.
BRONN: If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.
TYRION: Does he frighten you so much?
BRONN: I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... ...and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?
TYRION: Because you're my friend.
BRONN: Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?
TYRION doesn't answer. BRONN stands.
BRONN: I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more.
TYRION: I understand.
BRONN: I'm sorry it has to be this way.
TYRION: Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
TYRION extends his hand and BRONN shakes it heartily.
BRONN: We had some good days together.
TYRION: Yes, we did.
BRONN pats TYRION's arm, then walks to knock on the door.
BRONN: What will you do?
TYRION: I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
BRONN: I hope to hear them sing it one day.
BRONN exits.
INT. Meereen, DAENERYS's chambers at night.
DAENERYS enters to find DAARIO in her chambers.
DAENERYS: How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,
DAARIO: but your window is not.
DAENERYS walks to DAARIO, and he hands her some flowers.
DAARIO: I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
She hands them back.
DAENERYS: Don't do that again.
DAARIO: Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
DAENERYS: These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you.
DAENERYS sits. DAARIO kneels playfully for forgiveness.
DAARIO: Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.
DAENERYS: Tell me why you're here.
DAARIO rises.
DAENERYS: I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
DAARIO: You've ordered us to be night watchmen.
DAENERYS: And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.
DAARIO: There is only one, and she does not want me.
DAENERYS: You swore me your sword.
DAARIO: My sword is yours till the day I die.
DAENERYS: So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
DAARIO: I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
DAENERYS: Very well.
DAENERYS stands and pours herself some wine.
DAENERYS: Do what you do best.
She sits.
DAENERYS: Take off your clothes.
DAARIO smiles. DAENERYS watches has he removes his clothes.
INT. Bathing room at Storm's End, night
MELISANDRE lies in the bath. After knocking, SELYSE enters.
SELYSE: Oh.
MELISANDRE: Come in, my queen. Please.
SELYSE: I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.
MELISANDRE: You could never disturb me.
SELYSE: I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
MELISANDRE: Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
SELYSE reaches for a vial, but MELISANDRE stops her.
MELISANDRE: No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one.
SELYSE brings over the vial and MELISANDRE shakes some into the bath. She sighs.
MELISANDRE: When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, "Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count." A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid.
MELISANDRE: That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
SELYSE: If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?
MELISANDRE: Not always.
MELISANDRE leaves the bath and walks to the potions
SELYSE: Did you use it with Stannis?
MELISANDRE: No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
MELISANDRE touches SELYSE on the cheek.
MELISANDRE: It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
MELISANDRE puts on her robe.
SELYSE: No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home.
MELISANDRE takes her hand.
MELISANDRE: I understand how you feel.
SELYSE: Hmm.
MELISANDRE: But that is impossible.
SELYSE: Why?
MELISANDRE: You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.
They look into the fire.
MELISANDRE: However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her.
INT. Meeren hallway.
DAARIO walks down the hall, encountering JORAH.
DAARIO: Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.
DAARIO pats JORAH on the shoulder and exits.
INT. DAENERYS's chambers.
DAENERYS stands in her chambers. JORAH enters.
JORAH: Khaleesi.
DAENERYS: You're here early.
JORAH: Later than some.
DAENERYS: You don't approve?
JORAH: It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust.
DAENERYS: You neither approve nor trust.
JORAH: Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
DAENERYS: Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
JORAH: I did.
DAENERYS: I trust you.
JORAH: Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
DAENERYS: I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
JORAH: You have?
DAENERYS: I have.
JORAH: Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.
DAENERYS: That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.
JORAH: Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.
DAENERYS: And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
JORAH: It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.
DAENERYS: Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
JORAH: I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.
DAENERYS: And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
JORAH: I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
DAENERYS considers.
DAENERYS: The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
JORAH: Hizdahr zo Loraq?
DAENERYS: He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
JORAH: (Nods.)
DAENERYS:  Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind.
JORAH: Yes, Khaleesi.
JORAH starts to exit.
DAENERYS: No. Tell him you changed my mind.
JORAH exits.
EXT. The Riverlands, day
The HOUND and ARYA sit by the fire. The HOUND tends clumsily to his neck wound.
HOUND: Rat cunts. Fucking whore.
ARYA: You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right--
HOUND: No fire.
ARYA stands and takes a flaming stick to the HOUND.
ARYA: It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
The HOUND stands and backs away.
HOUND: No fire!
They stand silently. ARYA turns and puts the stick back in the fire. She sits and polishes Needle.
HOUND: Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going.
The HOUND sits.
HOUND: I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword.
He points to his face.
HOUND: My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
ARYA: Why?
HOUND: Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?
ARYA: Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
The HOUND doesn't answer. ARYA stands and walks to him. She pours water on his wound and begins to sew it.
INT. An Inn, night.
BRIENNE and PODRICK sit for dinner. The server places a pie in front of them.
BRIENNE: Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
PODRICK drinks greedily from his cup.
PODRICK: Couldn't agree more, my lady.
BRIENNE: Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
PODRICK: Yes, my lady.
BRIENNE stops PODRICK from drinking.
BRIENNE: Don't get drunk.
PODRICK: No, my lady.
HOT PIE: Can I get you anything else?
BRIENNE: No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful.
HOT PIE: Thanks. I do my best.
HOT PIE sits.
HOT PIE: A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?
BRIENNE: No.
HOT PIE: Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?
BRIENNE: We're looking for someone.
HOT PIE: Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had 17--
BRIENNE: A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.
HOT PIE: Starks? What, like them lot from "Winterhell"?
HOT PIE stands and starts to go.
HOT PIE: sNo, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here.
BRIENNE:  I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
HOT PIE: Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
EXT. Outside the Inn.
BRIENNE and PODRICK prepare the horses.
BRIENNE: What?
PODRICK: It's nothing, my lady.
BRIENNE:  You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
PODRICK: Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't.
BRIENNE: You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
PODRICK: The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
HOT PIE enters.
HOT PIE: My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
BRIENNE: What about? Not kidney pie.
HOT PIE: You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
BRIENNE: No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
HOT PIE: She weren't when I last spoke to her.
BRIENNE:  When was that?
HOT PIE: Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry.
BRIENNE:  So what happened to her?
HOT PIE: Well--
BRIENNE: The quick version.
HOT PIE: The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
PODRICK: The Hound.
HOT PIE: That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better.
PODRICK hands a small bundle to BRIENNE. He exits. BRIENNE opens the bundle to reveal a bread shaped like a wolf.
BRIENNE:  Um, you were saying?
EXT. The King's Road
BRIENNE and PODRICK walk their horses down the road.
BRIENNE:  Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.
PODRICK: They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.
BRIENNE: Why the Eyrie?
PODRICK: Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.
BRIENNE: Sansa could be there, too.
PODRICK: Aye, my lady. Could be.
BRIENNE:  You sure about this?
PODRICK: No.
They continue through the woods.
INT. TYRION's cell, night.
TYRION sits in the dark, sadly. The door opens and OBERYN enters, bearing a torch..
TYRION: I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
OBERYN: I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
TYRION: Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.
OBERYN puts down his torch and sits.
OBERYN: Your sister.
TYRION: Oh.
OBERYN:  Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
TYRION: Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
OBERYN: It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
TYRION: She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
OBERYN: Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago.
TYRION: I think I would have remembered that.
OBERYN: Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you.
TYRION: You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
OBERYN: The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.
TYRION: That would have made things so much easier.
OBERYN: When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, "Soon." Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. "That's not a monster," I told Cersei. "That's just a baby." And she said, "He killed my mother." And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. "It doesn't matter," she told us. "Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."
TYRION: Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.
OBERYN: And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
TYRION: If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.
OBERYN: I disagree.
OBERYN rises.
OBERYN: I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion.
EXT; The Aerie courtyard.
SANSA walks out to the courtyard. It is snowing. She builds a model of Winterfell from snow. ROBIN enters.
SANSA: Hello, Robin.
ROBIN: What are you doing?
SANSA: I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time.
ROBIN: Why did you leave?
SANSA: It's a long story.
ROBIN: I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
SANSA: Yes, you certainly are.
ROBIN: When will you go back?
SANSA: Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
ROBIN: Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
SANSA: No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground.
ROBIN: That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?
SANSA: We don't.
ROBIN: What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
SANSA: I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
ROBIN: Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door.
SANSA: I like the sound of that.
ROBIN: Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
SANSA: All right.
ROBIN: It can go in here in this big tower.
ROBIN reaches to show her, and accidentally knocks down the snow tower.
SANSA: Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
ROBIN: I didn't ruin it.
SANSA: You did.
ROBIN: It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.
SANSA: Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
ROBIN:  I didn't ruin it!
SANSA: You're being stupid.
ROBIN:  I didn't ruin it!
ROBIN, in a tantrum, kicks and smashes the snow castle. Shocked, SANSA slaps him. ROBIN exits, sobbing.
SANSA: Robin, I'm sorry, I--
LITTLEFINGER enters.
LITTLEFINGER: Children.
SANSA: I hit him.
LITTLEFINGER:  Yes, I saw.
SANSA: I shouldn't have done that.
LITTLEFINGER: No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction.
SANSA: If he tells Aunt Lysa...
LITTLEFINGER: Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
SANSA: I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
LITTLEFINGER: A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.
SANSA: Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
LITTLEFINGER: I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world.
LITTLEFINGER touches SANSA's hair.
LITTLEFINGER: You're more beautiful than she ever was.
SANSA: Lord Baelish...
LITTLEFINGER: Call me Petyr.
LITTLEFINGER kisses SANSA. Above them, LYSA has been watching, and she exits quickly.
INT. The Aerie throne room.
SANSA enters. LYSA stands looking out the moon door.
SANSA: You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?
LYSA: Come here, Sansa.
SANSA joins her beside the moon door.
LYSA: Do you know how far the fall is?
SANSA: No.
LYSA: Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did.
SANSA: I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen--
LYSA: Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr.
SANSA: I didn't. You don't understand.
LYSA grabs SANSA's forearm.
LYSA: I saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
SANSA:  He kissed me. I pulled away.
LYSA grabs SANSA's hair and forces her to lean over the moon door.
LYSA:  Liar! Whore! He is mine!
LYSA pushed SANSA onto her hands and knees.
SANSA: Please!
LYSA: My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!
LITTLEFINGER: Lysa! Let her go.
LYSA: You want her? This empty-headed child?
LITTLEFINGER: Let her go.
LYSA: She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?
LITTLEFINGER: I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa.
LYSA cries. She pushes SANSA away from the moon door and begins weeping. LITTLEFINGER approaches her and hugs her.
LITTLEFINGER: Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife.
LITTLEFINGER helps LYSA to stand.
LITTLEFINGER: I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister.
LITTLEFINGER pushes LYSA through the moon door. She screams as she falls.
[Open to the dark, seedy town of Moles Town. Two men walk toward a brothel with smiles on their faces]
MAN 1: Here we are.
[Inside everyone is happy, drinking, enjoying themselves. One woman is burping a tune]
MAN 2: The Rains of Castamere!
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: You fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, ya cunt.
[Everyone laughs and goes “ooooo”. She burps the same tune]
MAN 3: Oh, The Bear and the Maiden Fair!
[Everyone cheers]
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?
GILLY: Yes.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Well, what are you going to say?
GILLY: I'm sorry it woke you up.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will.
GILLY: Don't you ever touch him.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You should've stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?
GILLY: Shut your mouth.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.
GILLY: No it's not.
[The owl hoots again. A man walks toward a well and in the reflection it's seen that Styr sliced the mans throat. Tormund is also seen as the Wildlings walk through the town killing everyone. Ygritte is also there. Styr and the Wildlings break into the brothel, continuing their killing spree. Ygritte kills everyone upstairs, as she's leaving she hears Gilly's baby cry. Ygritte opens a drape in the back and motions them to keep quiet]
CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
SAM: I should never have left her there.
JON: You couldn't have known.
SAM: Of course I could've known. They were raiding the villages close by.
GRENN: And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?
ED: Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
GRENN: Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!
ED: I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.
GRENN: We pledged to guard the realms of men.
SAM: She's dead because of me.
GRENN: We can't even guard Mole's Town.
JON: We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want.
SAM: Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
PYP: Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did.
ED: She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.
SAM: She might have.
JON: If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close.
ED: A hundred thousand.
GRENN: And there's what, 5 of us left.
ED: If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two.
PYP: How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
ED: Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back.
[Everyone takes a drink]
CUT TO: MEEREEN
[Men and women are seen swimming in a lake. They're bathing and washing clothes. Grey Worm looks over at Missandei who is naked. Missandei sees him looking, he looks away ashamed then looks back. She stands up proudly, then covers up. He dunks his head under water]
DANY: You think he was spying on you?
MISSANDEI: No, not spying.
DANY: The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
MISSANDEI: Yes your grace.
DANY: But you are not Dothraki.
MISSANDEI: No.
DANY: Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes.
MISSANDEI: He was interested.
DANY: What?
MISSANDEI: I believe he was interested.
DANY: When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?
MISSANDEI: All of it?
DANY: The...the pillar an the stones.
MISSANDEI: I don't know, your grace.
DANY: Haven't you ever wondered?
MISSANDEI: Yes, your grace.
[Missandei is seen walking up toward Dany's throne. Grey Worm enters]
GREY WORM: Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
GREY WORM: *in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* No.
GREY WORM: The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I.
MISSANDEI: To me.
GREY WORM: To me.
MISSANDEI: I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
GREY WORM: Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word.
MISSANDEI: Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
GREY WORM: I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
MISSANDEI: When they cut you, do you remember that?
[Grey Worm shakes his head no]
MISSANDEI: I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
GREY WORM: Why? Why sorry?
MISSANDEI: It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
GREY WORM: *approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry.
[Grey Worm turns around and begins to walk away]
MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* Grey Worm.
[Grey Worm stops and turns around]
MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
GREY WORM: *in Valyrian* So am I.
[Grey Worm turns and walks out of the throne room]
CUT TO: MOAT CAILIN
RAMSAY: Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?
THEON: I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands.
RAMSAY: And what are you really?
THEON: I'm Reek.
RAMSAY: Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud.
THEON: I'm Reek.
RAMSAY: Until when?
THEON: Always. Forever.
RAMSAY: That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
[Theon approaches the castle on horseback]
GUARD 1: *to Theon* No closer. Who are you?
[Theon enters the castle walls. Inside a lot of people are sick or dying]
RALF: I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?
THEON: Yes.
RALF: And why should I believe that?
THEON: I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
EVERYONE: What is dead may never die.
RALF: And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?
THEON: Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
RALF: And what does Lord Bolton want?
[Theon hands Kenning a scroll]
THEON: You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
RALF: He wants us to surrender?
THEON: My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you.
[Kenning falls to the ground. His men pick him up]
RALF: ...shame fought with honor.
THEON: I'm sorry, I didn't hear...
[Kenning spits blood in Theon's face]
RALF: No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
THEON: *scared* You don't know.
RALF: The Ironborn will not surrender.
THEON: *whispering* Reek. Reek.
RALF: You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?
[MAN 4 kills Kenning with an axe]
THEON: Reek.
MAN 4: If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?
THEON: Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
[Cut to MAN 4's body with no skin and his eye cut out]
RAMSAY: You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?
THEON: Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
RAMSAY: I believe we will. To our new home.
CUT TO: THE VALE
You have foreign blood, don't you, Baelish?
PETYR: A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.
LORD ROYCE: Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
PETYR: The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce.
LORD ROYCE: She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
PETYR: My lord...
LORD ROYCE: And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn...
PETYR: Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
LADY ANYA: Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair.
PETYR: Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
LADY ANYA: She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
LORD ROYCE: Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door.
PETYR: She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
LORD ROYCE: We were told there was a witness. A girl.
LADY ANYA: A niece of yours, I believe.
PETYR: A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help.
LORD ROYCE: We'd like to speak with her.
PETYR: Let me fetch her.
LADY ANYA: No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
[Sansa Stark enters the room]
LADY ANYA: Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.
PETYR: My lady...
LADY ANYA: I wasn't asking you.
SANSA: He can stay.
LORD ROYCE: Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw.
SANSA: *to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything.
LADY ANYA: Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.
SANSA: My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.
LORD ROYCE: Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?
SANSA: Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.
SER VANCE: Your secret is safe with us, my lady.
LORD ROYCE: Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
LADY ANYA: Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.
SANSA: You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me.
LORD ROYCE: Lady Sansa.
SANSA: It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*
LADY ANYA: Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault.
[Sansa looks up at Petyr]
[Lord Royce, Lady Anya, and Petyr walk down the stairs]
LORD ROYCE: You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
LADY ANYA: Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
LORD ROYCE: Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly.
PETYR: You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same.
LADY ANYA: Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?
PETYR: For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl.
LORD ROYCE: Are you questioning our courage?
PETYR: I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?
LORD ROYCE: Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
PETYR: No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?
LADY ANYA: Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead.
PETYR: I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale.
LADY ANYA: Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
PETYR: And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
LADY ANYA: More often they die young.
PETYR: I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse.
LORD ROYCE: Aye, it's time.
PETYR: Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest.
CUT TO: MEEREEN
BOY: Ser Barristan.
SER BARRISTAN: Yes? Who sent you?
[A boy hands a scroll to Ser Barristan. He reads it]
[Ser Jorah is looking at a map by the water alone]
SER JORAH: Ser Barristan.
SER BARRISTAN: Ser Jorah.
SER JORAH: Have I forgotten a council meeting?
SER BARRISTAN: No.
[Ser Barristan hands Ser Jorah the scroll]
SER JORAH: What's this?
SER BARRISTAN: A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
SER JORAH: Who gave you this?
SER BARRISTAN: Does it matter?
SER JORAH: Have you told her?
SER BARRISTAN: I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back.
SER JORAH: Let me speak with her in private.
SER BARRISTAN: You'll never be alone with her again.
[Ser Barristan leaves]
[Ser Jorah enters Dany's throne room, walking toward her]
DANY: Why did the usurper pardon you?
SER JORAH: If we could speak alone.
DANY: No, speak to me here. Explain it to me.
SER JORAH: Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him.
DANY: The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
SER JORAH: It is not forged.
DANY: Why, then?
SER JORAH: I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing.
DANY: What was the content of these letters?
SER JORAH: Information.
DANY: What information?
SER JORAH: When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
DANY: You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
SER JORAH: I...
DANY: Yes or no?
SER JORAH: Khaleesi.
DANY: Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
SER JORAH: Yes.
DANY: That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
SER JORAH: I stopped you from drinking his wine.
DANY: Because you knew it was poisoned.
SER JORAH: I suspected.
DANY: You betrayed me from the first.
SER JORAH: Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me.
DANY: You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
SER JORAH: I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
DANY: ...and you want me to forgive you?
SER JORAH: I have loved you.
DANY: Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can.
SER JORAH: Daenerys, please.
[Ser Jorah goes for Dany's hand]
DANY: Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now.
[Ser Jorah rides away from Mereen]
CUT TO: MOAT CAILIN
[Ramsay is seen holding a flag out to Lord Bolton]
RAMSAY: Moat Cailin is yours, Father.
LORD BOLTON: Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
RAMSAY: No.
RAMSAY: Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see.
RAMSAY: Moors, fields, hills.
RAMSAY: Tell me what you see.
RAMSAY: Nothing.
ROOSE: Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?
RAMSAY: Ramsay Snow.
ROOSE: No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.
RAMSAY: You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise.
[The Bolton army rides forward on horseback]
RAMSAY: Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.
CUT TO: THE VALE
[Sansa is seen sitting on her bed sewing. Petyr knocks on her door]
SANSA: Yes?
PETYR: First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?
SANSA: They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
PETYR: That's not an answer.
SANSA: If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?
PETYR: I don't know.
SANSA: Neither do I.
PETYR: Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
SANSA: I know what you want.
PETYR: Do you?
[She looks up at him]
CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE VALE
[Arya and the Hound approach the Vale]
HOUND: I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy.
ARYA: Lots of things make me happy.
HOUND: Like what?
ARYA: Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.
HOUND: So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
ARYA: At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
HOUND: Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.
ARYA: You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
HOUND: I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel.
ARYA: That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
HOUND: *laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
ARYA: You should have let me burn it.
HOUND: It's a fleabite.
ARYA: That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
HOUND: Well, we won't have to walk too much further.
ARYA: You really think my aunt will pay for me?
HOUND: Aye, she'll pay.
ARYA: I've never even met her.
HOUND: Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about.
ARYA: I'm not a lady.
GUARD: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
HOUND: The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.
GUARD: Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.
[Arya bursts out laughing]
CUT TO: THE VALE
[Petyr is walking down the stairs with Robin]
ROBIN: I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave.
PETYR: You shouldn't be.
ROBIN: The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside.
PETYR: It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
[Sansa enters the scene and walks down the stairs, Petyr looks at her]
SANSA: Shall we go?
CUT TO: KING'S LANDING
[In prison, Tyrion drinks wine from Jaime]
TYRION: Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
JAIME: Soon.
TYRION: Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?
JAIME: I've never seen him fight.
TYRION: Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.
JAIME: Oberyn believes in himself.
TYRION: That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
JAIME: Beheading.
TYRION: Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.
JAIME: Cousins.
TYRION: Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?
JAIME: Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
TYRION: Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
TOGETHER: Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
TYRION: Nothing made him happier.
JAIME: Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
TYRION: On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
JAIME: The joke wore thin, though.
TYRION: For you. You drifted away.
JAIME: I had other interests.
TYRION: Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.
JAIME: Why?
TYRION: I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. "Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?" He gave me an answer. "Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.
JAIME: Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
TYRION: Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of "khuu, khuu, khuu". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard "khuu, khuu, khuu" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.
JAIME: Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?
TYRION: I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.
JAIME: He was twice your size.
TYRION: He just pushed me aside with a "khuu" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?
JAIME: I don't know.
[Bells begin chiming in the distance. Jaime goes to leave]
JAIME: Good luck today.
[Tyrion walks out toward the arena. The Lannisters are there, Oberyn is there getting ready for the battle. Tyrion passes him in handcuffs]
TYRION: Looks like very light armor.
OBERYN: I like to move around.
TYRION: You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
OBERYN: You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
TYRION: It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
OBERYN: Today is not the day I die.
ELLARIA: You're going to fight that?
OBERYN: I'm going to kill that.
ELLARIA: He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
OBERYN: Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
TYRION: Thank the gods.
PYCELL: In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion...
[Tywin speeds the process along in boredom. Horns sound to start the fight. Oberyn kisses Ellaria]
ELLARIA: Don't leave me alone in this world.
OBERYN: Never.
[Oberyn is tossed his weapon. He's very good with it. The crowd cheers]
OBERYN: Have they told you who I am?
MOUNTAIN: Some dead man.
[The Mountain lunges forward as the battle begins]
OBERYN: I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
OBERYN: I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
OBERYN: Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
OBERYN: You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
[Oberyn stabs the Mountain in the gut]
OBERYN: You raped her! You murdered her!
[Oberyn charges at the Mountain to give him one final blow]
OBERYN: You killed her children!
[Everyone looks down, surprised. Oberyn pulls his weapon out of the Mountain and starts walking around his body]
OBERYN: Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!
[The Mountain trips Oberyn and grabs him in his massive hands. He punches out his teeth and gets on top of Oberyn, squeezing his head]
MOUNTAIN: Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
[Ellaria screams in agony. Tyrion looks dead inside]
TYWEN: *standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.
[Opens on Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly standing on the edge of The Wall. It's night]
SAM: What was she like?
JON: She...she had red hair.
SAM: Oh? How big were her feet?
JON: Well what do you want me to say?
SAM: I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
JON: So you and Gilly never-
SAM: No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
JON: But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?
SAM: The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.
JON: What?
SAM: "I shall take no wife" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. "I shall father no children" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation.
JON: I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
SAM: Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?
JON: It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!
SAM: No, you're really not.
JON: And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
SAM: There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
JON: There will.
SAM: They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
JON: Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch.
[Sam gets in the lift back down off the wall. An owl perches on a post. Cut to the Wildlings where Thenn warg is standing with his eyes white. Ygritte, Tormund, and Styr are sitting in the background]
TORMUND: Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
YGRITTE: Yes.
TORMUND: Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--
YGRITTE: I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
TORMUND: We could be waiting here a while.
YGRITTE: Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting.
STYR: You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
YGRITTE: Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon.
STYR: Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
YGRITTE: I probably killed him already.
STYR: So you've said.
YGRITTE: And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
STYR: And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
[Everyone laughs. Ygritte gets up and rushes towards Styr]
YGRITTE: What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?
STYR: Maybe I have.
YGRITTE: Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.
[Gilly walks along the top of the hill with her baby, looking down at the Wildling camp. She walks away quickly. Cut to Sam in the library reading]
AEMON: And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?
SAM: Maester Aemon. How did you know-
AEMON: That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
SAM: Let me help you.
AEMON: Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?
SAM: Maester Faull
AEMON: Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library.
SAM: But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
AEMON: Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
SAM: I don't love her.
AEMON: Yes you do.
SAM: No.
AEMON: Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
SAM: You were?
AEMON: You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?
SAM: I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that.
AEMON: You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
SAM: Who was she?
AEMON: Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
[Aemon gets up and blows out the candle. Sam leaves the room and outside hears Gilly at the gate talking with Pypar]
PYP: I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!
GILLY: They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!
PYP: I'm sorry, I can't.
GILLY: If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do.
SAM: Pyp! Open the gate.
PYP: I can't.
GILLY: Sam, is that you?!
SAM: Yes!
PYP: Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
SAM: Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!
[Pyp goes to open the gate]
PYP: I've never heard you curse before.
SAM: Yes, well, best get used to it.
[Gilly runs inside and Sam embraces her]
SAM: Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella.
GILLY: It was horrible.
SAM: I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
GILLY: Don't let them send me away, Sam.
SAM: Never.
GILLY: I know there's no women allowed.
SAM: Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too.
[A horn sounds in the distance]
ALLISER: Get ready!
[Members of the Night's Watch can be heard shouting frantically. The owl screeches. Cut to Thenn warg whose eyes turn back to normal]
THENN WARG: It's time.
[The Wildlings get up and look at the hill. The owl flies away as the Night's Watch prepare for battle. Jon Snow walks out to the edge of The Wall and looks down upon flames in the distance. The Night's Watch light torches preparing for battle. Barrels are rolled to the edge of The Wall]
JANOS: Pick up the pace!
[The barrels are rolled into place]
JON: There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.
ALLISER: A hundred thousand you say?
JON: Yes sir.
ALLISER: You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
JON: It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.
ALLISER: Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job.
[Sam and Gilly are walking down a hall. Sam unlocks a door and they both enter. The room is filled with supplies. Gilly lays her baby on a sack of something]
SAM: You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
GILLY: You're leaving me again?
SAM: I'm not leaving you!
GILLY: You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
SAM: I...I didn't mean in the same room.
GILLY: What are you going to do out there?
SAM: Help my brothers.
GILLY: How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
SAM: I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
GILLY: Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here.
SAM: Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do.
[Sam kisses Gilly]
GILLY: Promise me you won't die.
SAM: I promise you I won't die.
[Sam turns around and leaves the room. Outside the Night's Watch is still getting ready for battle. Pyp sets some arrows up then stands back, scared]
SAM: There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
PYP: I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
SAM: Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us.
PYP: Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?
SAM: I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.
PYP: But you're afraid now?
SAM: Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore.
[Ygritte looks up at Castle Black. She sees Sam in the tower and she runs down the hill toward the other Wildlings]
YGRITTE: Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
STYR: How high are the walls?
YGRITTE: Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened.
TORMUND: Let's kill some Crows!
[Everyone cheers]
TORMUND: *yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*
[The Wildlings head towards Castle Black. Overhead shot pans to show the castle, The Wall, and then the flames in the distance. Mance Rayder's forces are seen stomping and yelling through the woods. A giant rides a giant mammoth. The Night's Watch perched upon the wall look down at them in awe]
ALLISER: Archers knock, everyone else hold.
[The archers get ready to shoot, Grenn accidentally drops a barrel]
ALLISER: I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!
NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!
ALLISER: Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!
NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!
ALLISER: You all plan to die here tonight?
NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!
ALLISER: That's very good to hear. Draw!
MEMBER 1: Help, down below.
[Tormund and his men rush Castle Black as archers shoot at them. Ygritte grabs flaming arrows from the ground and shots up at the Night's Watch]
JANOS: They're attacking the southern gates!
ALLISER: Now?
JANOS: Now!
ALLISER: I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall.
JANOS: What?!
ALLISER: What are you fucking waiting for, loose!
JANOS: You heard the man. Loose!
[The archers on The Wall let loose a barrage of arrows downward at Rayder's troops. They back up, then cheer. On the other side, Ygritte continues to let loose flaming arrows]
TORMUND: You, over there.
[Pyp shoots a crossbow down at Tormund's troops]
SAM: Did you get one?
PYP: No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam.
SAM: Yeah?
PYP: I think we're gonna die.
SAM: If you keep missing we will.
[Tormund's troops throw rope up at the gate. Alliser steps off the lift and walks towards the Night's Watch]
ALLISER: Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
NIGHT'S WATCH: No!
ALLISER: Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand.
[Night's Watch cheers]
ALLISER: The Night's Watch will stand.
[Night's Watch cheers]
ALLISER: With me now! Now, with me!
[Alliser and the Night's Watch rush at the Wildlings that have scaled the gate. Pyp and Sam leave their position as Tormund scales the gate. On the other side Rayder's troops advance]
JANOS: No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders.
JON: We can't just let them attack the gate!
JANOS: The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel.
JON: Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?
JANOS: No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
GRENN: Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya.
JANOS: Needed below? Yes. Yes.
[Janos runs away. Jon and Grenn nod at each other]
JON: Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
[The archers let loose a bunch of arrows at Rayder's men as they rush the wall and begin to climb]
JON: They won't summit before dawn.
GRENN: How do you know that?
JON: Because I've made that claim.
ED: I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.
[Archers of the Night's Watch are lowered perpendicular to The Wall]
JON: Knock! Draw! Loose!
[A Wildling tries to shoot an arrow up at The Wall unsuccessfully. A giant stands next to him and shoots his own arrow up. The first rips through one of the posts. The second clears one of the Night's Watch straight off the wall. At Castle Black the fighting continues. Styr kills a man, the blood splatters on Olly's face. Janos comes down off the lift and Olly returns the lift to the top. Wildlings break into the kitchen. Janos cowardly runs down a hall toward where Gilly and her baby are hiding. He looks at her in shock. Outside Pyp finally hits someone with his crossbow.]
PYP: I got one. Right through the heart, he's dead.
SAM: Oh, is it over?
PYP: Huh?
SAM: Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
[Pyp goes up to shoot a Wildling, but Ygrytte shoots an arrow right through his neck. He falls into Sam's arms]
SAM: You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright.
JON: Now!
ED: Now!
[The Night's Watch drop barrels down toward the Wildlings that approach the gate. Two giants and a mammoth approach the gate and begin pulling at it with long ropes]
JON: *to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate.
GRENN: Alright.
JON: *grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
GRENN: They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!
JON: Oil!
ED: Oil on the ramp!
ALLISER: Protect the gate!
[Alliser and Tormund start fighting each other like badasses. Tormund slices Alliser in the gut. Alliser falls to the ground and gets dragged  underneath]
ALLISER: Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!
[Sam sits with Pyp on his lap, dead. He lays him on the ground and grabs the crossbow. He makes a run for the lift as Thenn warg sees him and chases after him. Sam shoots him in the head with his crossbow. Grenn and the men that came down with him get off the lift]
SAM: *to Grenn* We need more men down here.
GRENN: We have to hold the gate.
SAM: But we need men here.
GRENN: Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!
[Sam gets in the lift]
SAM: *to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!
[Olly sits on the ground with his hands over his ears in fear]
SAM: Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?
[Olly raises the lift]
SAM: And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!
[Olly looks down at a bow and arrow. On The Wall, barrels of flaming oil are dropped down on the giants and the mammoth. The mammoth goes running off and one of the giants chases after it. Up top, one of the barrels got stuck and the men of the Night's Watch frantically try to get it off the ramp. A spear is fired down at one of the giants and it hits him right in the back. The other giant shouts in anger and goes to raise the gate with his bare hands. The barrel explodes on the ramp. Sam approaches Jon]
JON: What are you doing up here?
SAM: The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
JON: Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.
[Jon leaves his post and grabs his sword]
JON: Two brothers now fight with me.
ED: Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!
[Grenn gets to the inner gate with his men as the giant continues to raise the gate]
DONNEL: How are we gonna stop that?
COOPER: We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.
GRENN: You heard Jon, we hold the gate.
DONNEL: Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.
GRENN: We hold the gate!
[The giant lifts the gate and goes under it]
DONNEL: Mother save me. Father save me.
GRENN: The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?
DONNEL: No, please.
[The giant rushes toward the inner gate as Grenn and his men stand in fear, ready to fight]
GRENN: Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns
All TOGETHER: And win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!
[Jon, Sam, and the other men ride the lift to the bottom]
JON: *to Sam* I don't want you out there.
SAM: You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
[Jon hands Sam a key]
JON: I need him more than I need you.
[Sam nods as Jon opens the lift door early and leaps out and begins fighting. So begins the most incredible shot in the series, as the camera pans around the entire battlefield showing us glimpses of this truly epic battle. Sam runs to a door and unlocks it]
SAM: We need you boy.
[Ghost runs out and attacks one of the men that Jon was fighting. Tormund gets his first arrow to the back. Styr sees Jon and rushes to fight him. They go at it for a bit. Ygritte runs out of arrows so she jumps down and steals some from a dead body. Styr and Jon are still fighting as Ygritte finally spots Jon. Styr slams Jon's face against an anvil. Jon kills Styr with a hammer. As he turns around he sees Yrgitte with an arrow aimed right at him. They both stare, Jon smiles. An arrow goes straight through Ygritte's chest. She falls to the ground. It was Olly, that bastard. Jon rushes to catch Ygritte]
YGRITTE: Jon Snow.
JON: No, shh, don't talk.
YGRITTE: Do you remember that cave?
[Jon nods]
YGRITTE: We should've stayed in that cave.
JON: We'll go back there.
YGRITTE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.
[Ygritte dies. The battle rages on as Jon holds Ygritte's dead body. On the other side, Rayder's troops are climbing the wall]
ED: Drop the scythe, boys!
[A massive scythe drops down on the men]
ED: Hoister up!
[Rayder's troops retreat]
ED: They've had enough for one night.
[The Night's Watch cheers in excitement]
ED: Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.
[Inside Castle Black's walls Tormund is still alive, swinging his sword with two arrows in his back]
JON: Tormund. It's over, let it end.
TORMUND: This is how a man ends.
[Jon grabs a crossbow and shoots Tormund in the leg then kicks away his weapon]
JON: Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
TORMUND: I should've thrown you from the top of your wall boy!
JON: Aye, you should've.
[Gilly hears someone entering her room. She grabs a leg of meat as a weapon and rushes the door]
SAM: Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?
[Sam turns around and sees Janos. Outside the Night's Watch clean up after the battle. Sam and Jon descend the stairs]
SAM: We held them off.
JON: For one night.
SAM: This is a great victory.
JON: Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them.
SAM: Where are you going?
JON: I'm going to find Mance.
SAM: To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
JON: Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home.
SAM: Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
JON: I'm going to try.
SAM: They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him.
JON: He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
SAM: He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
JON: You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
[Jon stands there for a second as he and Sam look at each other, then he walks off, Sam scampering after him. They walk down the tunnel toward the gate. The giant and Grenn and his men are dead on the ground]
JON: They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out.
[Sam waves his torch to signal the raising of the gate. Jon removes his sword]
SAM: What are you doing?
JON: I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
SAM: Jon. Come back.
[The gate raises and Jon walks through it]
[Jon Snow leaves the tunnel and walks out into the snow. Smoking dead bodies lie all around him. As he walks into the forest he becomes surrounded by Wildlings. He has entered the Wildling camp unarmed]
MANCE: You're wearing a black cloak again.
JON: I've been sent to negotiate with you.
[Mance and Jon enter Mance's tent and take a seat]
MANCE: It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was.
JON: The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows.
MANCE: All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?
JON: She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
MANCE: Did you see her again at Castle Black?
JON: Yes.
MANCE: And?
JON: She's dead.
MANCE: Your doing?
JON: No.
MANCE: We'll drink to her.
[One of the Wildlings gets two cups and fills them with liquid. Jon looks at Mance]
MANCE: Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last.
[They pick up their cups]
MANCE: Ygritte.
JON: Ygritte.
[They take a sip and Jon begins to cough]
JON: That's not wine.
MANCE: No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty.
JON: He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
MANCE: He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
JON: Grenn came from a farm.
[They lift their cups]
MANCE: Mag and Grenn.
JON: Grenn and Mag.
MANCE: Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?
JON: Turn your army around and go home.
MANCE: You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
JON: I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
MANCE: I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black.
[Jon looks over towards the knife. The Wildlings get their weapons ready]
MANCE: Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?
[A horn blows in the distance. Everyone scrambles, Mance draws a knife to Jon's neck]
MANCE: You attacking us?
JON: No, it's like you said, we don't have the men.
[The Wildlings run around frantically. Men on horseback ride toward them]
MANCE: Hold! To me. To me.
[The horsemen continue toward the Wildlings, killing all in their path. The Wildlings fight back, clearly outnumbered]
MANCE: Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.
[Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth ride up toward Mance Rayder. They get off their horses. Mance disarms himself]
STANNIS: You're the king beyond the wall?
[Mance nods]
STANNIS: You know who I am?
MANCE: Never had the pleasure.
DAVOS: This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms.
MANCE: We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
STANNIS: It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
MANCE: We do not kneel.
STANNIS: I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king.
MANCE: All the same, we do not kneel.
STANNIS: Take these men away.
DAVOS: What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
JON: I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
DAVOS: You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
JON: I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son.
STANNIS: Your father was an honorable man.
JON: He was, your grace.
STANNIS: What do you think he'd have done with him?
JON: I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.
STANNIS: Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
JON: Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them.
CUT TO: KING'S LANDING
[Qyburn is seen closely analyzing Gregor's body. He's in Pycelle's lab with Cersei]
PYCELLE: I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
CERSEI: Bloody Martells.
PYCELLE: The cause appears to be manticore venom.
QYBURN: It is, yes, manticore.
PYCELLE: I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done.
QYBURN: Yes there is.
PYCELLE: May I ask what you think you're doing?
QYBURN: Saving him.
PYCELLE: Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester.
QYBURN: That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
PYCELLE: That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion.
CERSEI: You're dismissed, Grand Maester.
PYCELLE: Your grace. This is my laboratory!
CERSEI: Not anymore.
[Pycelle leaves the laboratory angrily as Qyburn tries to save Gregor's body]
CERSEI: You can save him?
QYBURN: Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance.
CERSEI: Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
QYBURN: Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat.
CERSEI: Will it weaken him?
QYBURN: Oh no.
CERSEI: Very well then.
[Cersei leaves as Qyburn drains Gregor's blood. Cersei is seen arguing with Tywin]
TYWIN: Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed.
CERSEI: I'm opening it again.
TYWIN: You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
CERSEI: I will not.
TYWIN: Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.
CERSEI: I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king.
TYWIN: When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-
CERSEI: I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
TYWIN: Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
CERSEI: When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away.
TYWIN: No.
CERSEI: Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.
TYWIN: And how will you do that?
CERSEI: I'll tell everyone the truth.
TYWIN: And what truth would that be?
CERSEI: You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known.
TYWIN: Known what?
CERSEI: Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
TYWIN: No, no, no, no, no.
CERSEI: Your legacy is a lie.
TYWIN: I don't believe you.
CERSEI: Yes you do.
[Cersei walks away, leaving Tywin standing there alone. Jaime is turning pages in a book in another room]
CERSEI: Jaime.
JAIME: You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?
CERSEI: For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.
JAIME: Tyrion is your family.
CERSEI: He's not.
JAIME: You don't get to choose.
CERSEI: I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-
JAIME: Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
CERSEI: A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?
JAIME: The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-
[Cersei kisses Jaime]
CERSEI: I choose you.
JAIME: Those are words.
CERSEI: Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
JAIME: Told him what?
CERSEI: I told him about us.
JAIME: You told him?
CERSEI: I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.
JAIME: You think he'll just accept that?
CERSEI: Go and ask him.
[Cersei kisses Jaime]
JAIME: What did you say?
CERSEI: I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters.
[Cersei kisses Jaime's metal hand. Jaime pulls her close and kisses her]
JAIME: Someone will walk in.
CERSEI: I don't care.
[Jaime picks Cersei up and lays her on the table as the start having sex.]
CUT TO: MEREEN
[Daenerys is sitting on her throne listening to her people's problems]
MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.
FENNESZ: *in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish.
DAENERYS: You speak it very well.
FENNESZ: Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much.
DAENERYS: I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
FENNESZ: When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets.
DAENERYS: I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
FENNESZ: I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist.
DAENERYS: My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you.
FENNESZ: Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children.
DAENERYS: What is it that you want from me?
FENNESZ: Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.
DAENERYS: You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?
FENNESZ: Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-
DAENERYS: I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
FENNESZ: Thank you, your grace. Thank you.
[Fennesz leaves slowly]
BARRISTAN: The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
[Another man enters the hall]
DAENERYS: Approach my friend.
MAN: *in Low Valyrian* I do not understand, my queen. I do not understand, my queen.
MISSANDEI: *in Low Valyrian* The Queen says you may approach.
MAN: *crying, speaking Low Valyrian*
MISSANDEI: *translating* I have brought you. He came from the sky. The black one. The winged shadow. He came from the sky and...
[The man kneels on the ground sobbing, laying a pile of burnt bones on the ground]
MISSANDEI: *translating* My girl. My little girl.
[The man continues to sob. In another room Daenerys is speaking with Missandei]
DAENERYS: What was her name?
MISSANDEI: Zala, your grace.
DAENERYS: How old was she?
MISSANDEI: Three.
DAENERYS: Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?
GREY WORM: *in Valyrian* Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my queen. Nothing since then.
DAENERYS: *in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.
[The entrance to the catacombs is rolled open. Daenerys' dragons enter followed by Daenerys. Inside there is food for them. They chomp at the food as Daenerys puts a chain collar around their necks. She walks away crying as they screech at her. She turns around as the catacombs close with tears in her eyes.]
CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
[Aemon and the rest of the Night's Watch burn the bodies of their fallen comrades]
AEMON: They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west. They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names. It is for us to remember them. Our brothers, we shall never see their like again.
ALL TOGETHER: And now their watch is ended.
AEMON: And now their watch is ended.
Aemon passes the torch around as each member of the Night's Watch helps burn the bodies. Stannis watches from above. [Jon Snow and Melisandre share a look]
TORMUND: Your old blind man patched me up. Why?
JON: He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.
TORMUND: You want me alive so you can torture me?
JON: No one's going to torture you.
TORMUND: So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?
JON: I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
TORMUND: Who decides?
JON: I suppose Stannis does.
TORMUND: He your king now?
JON: I don't have a king.
TORMUND: You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again.
JON: We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?
TORMUND: Words? What kind of words?
JON: Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
TORMUND: Do what?
JON: Say farewell.
TORMUND: The dead can't hear us, boy.
[Jon walks away]
TORMUND: Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.
JON: She told you?
TORMUND: No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?
[Jon leaves and takes Ygritte's body out past The Wall. He burns her body in a pile of logs.]
CUT TO: BEYOND THE WALL
[Hodor drags Bran through the snow followed by Jojen and Meera Reed]
MEERA: We can stop, we can rest.
JOJEN: We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.
[Jojen falls to the ground]
MEERA: We're not going to make it.
JOJEN: We're already here.
BRAN: Jojen. Jojen! Look, Jojen, look.
[The group stands at the edge of a cliff. A large tree is seen  not too far off in the distance. They head toward it. As they walk a skeleton hand reaches up and drags Jojen to the ground. It starts pulling him backwards as Meera runs towards him]
MEERA: JOJEN! Hold on!
BRAN (to Hodor): Help them! Now!
MEERA: Hold on to me!
[More hands burst from the ground.]
HODOR: Hodor...
BRAN: Help them!
[Skeleton warriors have now emerged from the ground. They attack Jojen, Meera and Hodor. A brawl ensues. One of them attacks Bran until his direwolf, Summer, fights it off. Bran then wargs into Hodor and starts fighting back.]
JOJEN: Bran! Save yourself, now!
[Meera defeats a skeleton warrior, only to see another repeatedly stabbing Jojen. Just as two skeletons close in on the warging Bran, they’re destroyed by two fireballs, apparently controlled by a young girl.]
GIRL: Come with me, Brandon Stark!
[She looks at Meera and Jojen.]
GIRL: He is lost. Come with me, or die with him.
[JOJEN: Go with them.
The girl throws some more fireballs and the group move into a cave. When the skeletons try to follow, they explode.]
GIRL: They cannot follow us. The power that moves them is powerless here.
BRAN: Who are you?
GIRL: The First Men called us The Children, but we were born long before them. Come, he waits for you.
[They enter a room filled with tree roots. An old man is seated in the center. Bran approaches him.]
BRAN: You’re the three-eyed raven.
OLD MAN: I have been many things. Now, I am what you see.
MEERA: My brother, he led us to you, and now he…
OLD MAN: He knew what would happen. From the moment he left, he knew, and he went anyway.
MEERA: How do you know?
OLD MAN: I’ve been watching you. All of you, all of your lives, with a thousand eyes and one. Now you’ve come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late.
BRAN: I didn’t want anyone to die for me.
OLD MAN: He died so that you could find what you have lost.
BRAN: You’re going to help me walk again?
OLD MAN: You’ll never walk again. But you will fly.
CUT TO: THE RIVERLANDS
[Brienne and Podrick wake up in the open air on their way to the Eyrie.]
BRIENNE: Podrick. Podrick! Where are the horses?
PODRICK: I hobbled them last night.
BRIENNE: What sort of hobble?
PODRICK: A figure-eight, like you taught me.
BRIENNE: If you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.
PODRICK: Thieves, maybe?
BRIENNE: It’s at least thirty miles to the Eyrie from here. You’re carrying the saddle bags.
[Brienne sees Arya Stark practising her river-dancing.]
ARYA: People coming. You can shit later, there’s people coming!
BRIENNE: Morning!
ARYA: Morning.
BRIENNE: I like your sword. Are we getting close to the bloody gate?
ARYA: About ten more miles.
BRIENNE: Did you hear that Podrick? Only about ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.
ARYA: Are you a knight?
BRIENNE: No.
ARYA: But you know how to use that sword.
BRIENNE: I do.
ARYA: Does it have a name?
BRIENNE: “Oathkeeper.”
ARYA: Mine’s “Needle.”
BRIENNE: Good name.
ARYA: Who taught you how to fight?
BRIENNE: My father.
ARYA: Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.
BRIENNE: Mine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said, “If you’re going to do it, you might as well do it right.”
[Sandor “The Hound” Clegane emerges.]
BRIENNE: Seven blessings. I’m Brienne of Tarth, this is Podrick Payne.
HOUND: You want something?
BRIENNE: You’re Arya Stark.
HOUND: I asked if you wanted something.
BRIENNE: I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.
ARYA: My mother’s dead.
BRIENNE: I know. I wish I could’ve been there to protect her.
ARYA: You’re not a northerner.
BRIENNE: I know, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.
ARYA: Why didn’t you?
BRIENNE: She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King’s Landing.
HOUND: You’re paid by the Lannisters. You’re here for the bounty on me.
BRIENNE: I’m not paid by the Lannisters.
HOUND: No? Fancy sword you’ve got there. Where’d you get it? I’ve been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth, tell me that’s not Lannister gold.
BRIENNE: Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
ARYA: The Bloody Gate’s ten miles.
BRIENNE: I swore to your mother by the Old Gods and the New -
ARYA: I don’t care what you swore!
BRIENNE: Arya!
HOUND: You heard the girl! She’s not coming with you.
BRIENNE: She is.
[Brienne and The Hound both draw their swords.]
BRIENNE: Come with me Arya. I’ll take you to safety.
HOUND: Safety?! Where the fuck’s that? Her aunt in the Eyrie’s dead. Her mother’s dead, her father’s dead, her brother’s dead. Winterfell’s a pile of rubble. There’s no safety, you dumb bitch. If you don’t know that by now, you’re the wrong one to watch over her.
BRIENNE: And that’s what you’re doing? Watching over her?
HOUND: Aye, that’s what I’m doing.
[They begin a swordfight. The Hound seems to have the upper hand but Brienne defends well and floors him.]
BRIENNE: I have no wish to kill you Ser.
[The Hound grabs Brienne’s blade with his palms, shoves it to one side and punches her.]
HOUND: I’m not a knight.
[They fight bare-handed, Brienne bites off The Hound's ear, then The Hound draws a knife, and Brienne grabs a rock. She pushes The Hound down a steep cliff.]
BRIENNE: Arya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?
PODRICK: She was just here...
BRIENNE: Why weren’t you watching her?
PODRICK: I was watching you I thought you migth need some help…
BRIENNE: Which way Pod? Which way did she go?
PODRICK: Ah, I think that way.
BRIENNE: Arya!
[The camera moves to show us Arya hiding just above Brienne. She walks down to The Hound.]
HOUND: You’re still here? [Coughs] Big bitch saved you.
ARYA: I don’t need saving.
HOUND: No, not you. You’re a real killer. With your water dancing, and your needle.
ARYA: You’re gonna die?
HOUND: Unless there’s a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I’m done. I’d skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. (Chuckles) I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. She’ll help you. Going out alone, you won’t last a day out there.
ARYA: I’ll last longer than you.
HOUND: You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I’m ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher’s boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don’t kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher’s boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I should’ve taken her. That night the Blackwater burned, I should’ve fucked her bloody. At least I’d have one happy memory! Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it.
[Arya stands up, takes The Hound’s coin purse, and walks away.]
HOUND: Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
CUT TO: KING'S LANDING
[We enter Tyrion’s cell. The door opens.]
TYRION: Oh, get on with it you son of a whore.
JAIME: Is that any way to speak about our mother?
TYRION: What’re you doing?
JAIME: What do you think I’m doing? The galley’s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
TYRION: Who’s helping you?
JAIME: Varys.
TYRION: Varys?
JAIME: You have more friends than you thought.
[They reach the end of the underground tunnel.]
JAIME: There’s a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open.
TYRION: I suppose this is goodbye, then.
[They hug.]
JAIME: Farewell, little brother.
TYRION: Jaime, thank you. For my life.
JAIME: Quickly now.
[Tyrion takes a torch and uses a trap door to enter a room. There is a woman sleeping on a double bed, and we see the booch of the Hand of the King.]
WOMAN: Tywin… my lion...
[We see that the woman is Shae. She grabs a knife, and she and Tyrion struggle. Tyrion eventually strangles her with the bedclothes, weeping.]
TYRION: I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
[Tyrion takes a crossbow from the wall and walks in on Tywin on the privy.]
TYWIN: Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we’ll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…
TYRION: All my life, you’ve wanted me dead.
TYWIN: Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what’s yours. I’d never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I’d never let Illyn Payne take your head. You’re a Lannister. You’re my son.
TYRION: I loved her.
TYWIN: Who?
TYRION: Shae.
TYWIN: Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow.
TYRION: I murdered her. With my own hands.
TYWIN: It doesn’t matter.
TYRION: It doesn’t matter?
TYWIN: She was a whore!
TYRION: Say that word again.
TYWIN: And what? You’ll kill your own father in the privy? No. You’re my son. Enough of this nonsense…
TYRION: I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn’t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?
TYWIN: Enough. We’ll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
TYRION: I can’t go back there. She’s in there.
TYWIN: What, are you afraid of a dead whore?
[Tyrion fires the crossbow at Tywin.]
TYWIN: You shot me. You’re no son of mine.
TYRION: I am your son. I have always been your son.
[Tyrion fires again.]
VARYS: What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I’ve brought you this far.
[Varys loads Tyrion, in a transport container, onto a ship. He goes to walk back to King's Landing, but turns around and boards the ship himself]
CUT TO: THE RIVERLANDS
[We go back to Arya, alone. She rides her horse to a small port.]
ARYA: I want to see the captain.
CAPTAIN: You’re seeing him.
ARYA: I want to go north, to the wall.
CAPTAIN: No you don’t.
ARYA: I can pay.
CAPTAIN: There is nothing in the north but ice and war and pirates.
ARYA: I wouldn’t need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or…
CAPTAIN: I’m not going north, child, we’re going home.
ARYA: Where’s home?
CAPTAIN: The Free City of Braavos.
ARYA: Wait, I have something else.
CAPTAIN: More silver won’t make a difference.
ARYA: It’s not silver, it’s iron.
[Arya hands over the token she was given by Jaqen H'ghar.]
ARYA: Valar morghulis.
CAPTAIN: How did you… valar dohaeris. Of course, you shall have a cabin.
[We see Arya aboard the ship.]
