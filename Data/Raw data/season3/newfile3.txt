EXT: North of the Wall
The screen is black. A white walker unleashes a horrendous screech.  Weapons clash while men grunt and scream in the sounds of battle.
MAN: Fall back!
EXT: North of the Wall
It is dawn. The wind howls as Sam runs, desperate and exhausted, through blizzard conditions of blinding snow.
SAM: ( Panting and breathing heavily. )
Sam comes to a halt. Just ahead,   Night's Watchman kneels in the  snow.
SAM: Brother?
Sam approaches the kneeling figure, and realizes that the man is decapitated and holding his own lifeless head in his lap. Sam looks ill and defeated. Behind him, a figure strides towards him, axe drawn. Sam turns and his eyes widen as he sees the undead freefolk striding towards him. The ghoul raises his axe to strike, and Sam recoils and falls. As the last moment, a direwolf pounces on the undead man, saving Sam's life. As Sam lies stunned, Ghost pulls the his attacker away by the ankle. The ghoul shakes his way free and claws forward to Sam, grabbing at his legs. As Sam scrambles backwards, a torch lights the ghoul on fire. Engulfed in flames, the undead wildling finally collapses. Sam looks up to see Jeor and the Night's Watch. He rises.
JEOR: Did you send the ravens?
Sam keeps his eyes on the ground in shame.
JEOR: Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens?
SAM: (Shakes his head.)
JEOR: That was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead.
MAIN CREDITS
EXT: Beyond the Wall
The party, including RATTLESHIRT, JON SNOW and YGRITTE,  return to the  bustling wildling camp. A giant walks by, carrying a bundle of huge stakes. JON is awed.
YGRITTE: First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?
JON:  (Nods)
The giant  drives a large stake into the ground.
YGRITTE: Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail.
The giant finishes his work and looks at Jon, growling. The party continues to walk through the camp, and the wildlings heckle JON has he passes.
MAN: Crow!
BOY: Crow!
GIRL: Look over there!
MAN #2: Crow!
GIRL: Crow! Look over here! Look!
WOMAN: Ah, look, crow coming!
BOY: Crow!
YGRITTE: You're wearing the wrong color.
JON SNOW: Mance was a ranger.
YGRITTE: In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.
JON SNOW: When I'm free, will I be free to go?
BOY: Crow!
BOY: Crow!
Boys throw rocks at JON SNOW.
YGRITTE: Sure, you will.
YGRITTE swats a boy with her staff.
BOY: Oh! ( laughter )
YGRITTE: And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.
JON SNOW: What happened to their fathers?
YGRITTE: Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't...
INT: A freefolk tent
RATTLESHIRT, JON and YGRITTE enter the tent. TORMUND eats hungrily by the fire.
TORMUND: I smell a crow.
LORD OF BONES: We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.
TORMUND: What do we want with a baby crow?
YGRITTE: This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.
TORMUND rises and stares at JON.
TORMUND: That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.
JON SNOW: My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
TORMUND: Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?
JON SNOW: Jon Snow.
JON kneels before TORMUND, mistaking him for MANCE RAYDER, the King-beyond-the-Wall.
JON SNOW: Your Grace.
The wildlings laugh
TORMUND: Your Grace?
Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart. ( Laughs. )
Mance rises from the back of the tent.
MANCE: Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.
JON rises.
MANCE: So, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us.
Lord of Bones leaves. YGRITTE gives JON a look, and exits as well.
MANCE: The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?
TORMUND: Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls.
MANCE: This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
TORMUND:  Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
MANCE: He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.
MANCE extends his hand,  and JON SNOW shakes it. Mance holds on firmly.
MANCE: He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?
JON SNOW: The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
MANCE: Why?
JON SNOW: He wants me to lead one day.
MANCE: But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall.
JON SNOW:  If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.
TORMUND glowers.
MANCE: Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?
JON SNOW: (Hesitates.) I want to be free.
MANCE: No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?
MANCE's guard rise and close in, menacingly.
JON SNOW: We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
MANCE: You saw what?
JON SNOW: I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
MANCE: You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?
JON SNOW: Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?
MANCE: We'll need to find you a new cloak.
EXT. King's Landing
Children chatter and play in the water outside of King's Landing
INT. KIng's Landing Whorehouse
BRONN and a WHORE lie abed, enjoying themselves.
BRONN: What if you took off that bit there?
WHORE: Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?
BRONN: Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.
She rises.
WHORE: I want you to take it off.
BRONN moves to remove it, and she tsks, putting her finger to her lips.
WHORE: Mouth.
A door opens, and PODRICK enters.
PODRICK: Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.
BRONN: I didn't hear that.
PODRICK: Apologies, ser.
BRONN: Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.
PODRICK: Lord Tyrion sent me.
BRONN: I will murder you, boy.
PODRICK: He said it was a matter of life and death.
INT. Tyrion's quarters
Tyrion looks at his scar in the mirror. There is a knocking at the door.
TYRION: Pod?
CERSEI: Cersei: It's your sister. The queen.
Tyrion puts down the mirror and moves a stool to the door. He opens the door's window looks through the door to see Cersei and guards Meryn Trant and Taryn Mant.
TYRION: What are they doing here?
CERSEI: Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?
TYRION: No, I don't think so.
CERSEI: If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?
Tyrion considers.
TYRION: They stay outside.
CERSEI: I'm not afraid of you, little brother.
Tyrion grabs an axe, and opens the door cautiously. As soon as Cersei enters, he secures the door closed..
TYRION: Why are you here?
CERSEI: I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.
TYRION: The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
CERSEI: I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father.
TYRION: Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.
CERSEI: No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
Tyrion pours himself some wine.
TYRION: Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
CERSEI: You're meeting Father today?
TYRION: How do you know that?
CERSEI: Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
TYRION: What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.
CERSEI: You're going to make me cry.
TYRION: Why do you care what I want from him?
CERSEI: Because you've slandered me to Father before.
TYRION: Slandered? When?
CERSEI: You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
TYRION: You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.
CERSEI: I was nine, too.
TYRION: She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.
CERSEI: If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.
TYRION: It's not slander if it's true.
CERSEI: And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
TYRION: Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
CERSEI: Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.
TYRION: Any lies in particular?
CERSEI: You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are.
TYRION: Still makes me more clever than you.
INT. outside Tyrion's quarters.
Taryn Mant and Meryn Trant stand guard. A door opens and BRONN and PODROCK enter.
BRONN: Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares.
MERYN TRANT: Ser Meryn Trant.
BRONN: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
MERYN TRANT: You're no knight.
BRONN: Pod.
PODRICK: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
MERYN TRANT: You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more.
BRONN: That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.
Bronn strides forward, and the two guard block him.
MERYN TRANT: You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand.
They begin to draw their weapons. At that moment, Tyrion's door opens, and Cersei exits Tyrion's chambers. She walks away with Meryn Trant and Taryn Mant. Bronn sheaths his dagger.
EXT. King's Landing
Tyrion, Bronn and Podrick walk along the wall.
BRONN: As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me.
TYRION: A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
BRONN: I've been doing that for a while now.
TYRION: Do you grow bored protecting me?
BRONN: I grow poor protecting you.
TYRION: Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.
BRONN: Briefly.
TYRION: I'm sure you filled your pockets.
BRONN: And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more.
TYRION: I thought we were friends.
BRONN: We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
TYRION: How much?
BRONN: Double.
TYRION: Double?
BRONN: I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
TYRION: I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
BRONN: Which means you can afford it.
EXT.  Blackwater Bay
Davos lies on a rocky shore, bruised, battered, and dehydrated. He looks out to the sea and sees a boat in the distance. He climbs atop the rocks and starts waving. He removes his shirt in desperation and waves that as well.
DAVOS: Here. Here! Help me!
Davos starts to lose hope. Then a horn blows from the distant boat. He is relieved.
CUT TO: the same shore, a bit later.
A ships' boat has made it to Davos. He greets them as they row to him
MAN: Who are you?
DAVOS: I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
MAN: Aye, ser, and serving which king?
Davos hesitates.
DAVOS: The one true king of Westeros ...  Stannis Baratheon.
The man smiles slightly and throws a rope to Davos.
INT. Salladhor's ship
Davos and Salladhor sit in the captain's quarters. Davos sits and Salladhor stands above him.
SALLADHOR: I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?
DAVOS: (Nods)
SALLADHOR: He may have swam ashore as you did.
DAVOS: No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.
Salladhor sits.
SALLADHOR: I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father.
DAVOS: If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?
SALLADHOR: He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
DAVOS: Will you take me there?
SALLADHOR: There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
DAVOS: This war is not over.
SALLADHOR: Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.
DAVOS: We're both sworn to King Stannis.
SALLADHOR: I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.
DAVOS: Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
SALLADHOR: He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive.
DAVOS: What?
SALLADHOR: They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.
Salladhor stands and pours himself some wine, then sits again
SALLADHOR: I'm a pirate.
DAVOS: You're a smuggler.
SALLADHOR: Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
DAVOS: Take me back there, please.
SALLADHOR: You cannot turn Stannis against her.
DAVOS: Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.
SALLADHOR: You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend.
DAVOS: You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
SALLADHOR: And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors.
DAVOS: I have to stop her. Please, do this for me.
SALLADHOR: When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck.
EXT. Outside Harrenhal
Horses trot as Robb's army is on the move.
ROOSE BOLTON: We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal.
ROBB: There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
ROOSE BOLTON: I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.
ROBB: The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
Robb's army advances
EXT. Harrenhall
Robb's forces have arrived at Harrenhall. ROBB surveys a courtyard that littered with bodies. Flies buzz noisily among the corpses. RICKARD KARSTARK and ROOSE BOLTON enter.
RICKARD KARSTARK: 200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
ROOSE BOLTON: The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons.
RICKARD KARSTARK: Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
ROOSE BOLTON: The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.
Robb and Catelyn walk somberly  through the courtyard.
ROBB: Robb: A Mallister?
CATELYN: Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
RICKARD KARSTART and ROOSE BOLTON exit.
ROBB: Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
Talisa approaches.
TALISA: Talisa: She's your mother.
ROBB: She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
Qyburn coughs nearby, and Talisa moves to tend to him
QYBURN: ( coughing ) Water. Water.
TALISA: This needs to be cleaned and closed.
ROBB: What's your name, friend?
QYBURN: Qyburn.
TALISA: You're lucky to be alive.
QYBURN: Lucky?
INT. King's Landing.
The Hand's Chambers. Tywin works at his desk while Tyrion looks on.
TYRION: ( sighs ) The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
TYWIN: Am I enjoying it?
TYRION: I was very happy as Hand of the King.
TYWIN: ( chuckles ) Yes. I heard how happy you were. ( blows ) You brought a whore into my bed.
TYRION: It wasn't your bed at the time.
Tywin seals the letter he has finished.
TYWIN: I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.
TYRION: Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
TYWIN: What do you want, Tyrion?
TYRION: Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
Tywin stands and takes a goblet of wine.
TYWIN: Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
TYRION: I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start.
TYWIN: Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want.
Tywin sits.
TYRION: I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir.
TYWIN: You want Casterly Rock?
TYRION: It is mine by right.
TYWIN: ( sighs ) We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.
TYRION: Why?
TYWIN: Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go.
Tyrion gets up, dejected, and starts to leave.
TYWIN: Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.
Tyrion exits briskly in anger.
EXT. King's Landing Shore
Sansa and Shea sit on a dock.
SANSA: Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
SHAE: Why Dorne?
SANSA: It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
SHAE: I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.
SANSA: Don't ruin the game.
SHAE: I told you, I don't want to play.
SANSA: (pointing to another ship) What about that one there?
SHAE: That one? It's going to Volantis.
SANSA: Why?
SHAE: Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.
SANSA: That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
SHAE: Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
Littlefinger and Ros walk onto the dock.
SANSA: Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
Littlefinger approaches.
LITTLEFINGER: Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
SANSA: Lord Baelish.
LITTLEFINGER: Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
Shae looks to Sansa, then stands and walks back to Ros.
LITTLEFINGER: I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
SANSA: Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
LITTLEFINGER: You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
SANSA: I won't tell anyone.
LITTLEFINGER: How do I know?
SANSA: Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when.
LITTLEFINGER: I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.
Further back on the dock, Ros approaches Shae
ROS: You're her handmaiden?
SHAE: Yes. And you're his...?
ROS: I help manage his affairs.
SHAE: He's an important person.
ROS: So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I.
SHAE: Yes.
ROS: Given where we started.
SHAE: And where is that?
ROS: It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.
Littlefinger leaves Shae and walks towards them.
SHAE: I always do.
ROS: Watch out for her with him.
EXT. The Seas outside Slaver's Bay
Dragons  screech as they fly next to a boat at sea. On the deck are DAENERYS and JORAH watch them. Drogon dives and catches a fish. He cooks it with his fire breath and swallows it. He lands next to DAENERYS for affection.
JORAH: They're growing fast.
DAENERYS: Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army
Drogon screeches again and takes flight.
JORAH: We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
DAENERYS: The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
JORAH: Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
DAENERYS: It's too beautiful a day to argue.
A Dothraki man vomits on the deck below
JORAH: You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.
DAENERYS: Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ...
JORAH: The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before.
EXT. The shore outside Dragonstone.
The ship's boat has dropped Davos off below Dragonstone, and started back to sea. Davos begins to walk to the castle.
INT. Dragonstone war room.
Stannis sits, looking out to the sea, with Melissandre standing beside him. Davos enters.
DAVOS: Your Grace.
STANNIS: I heard you were dead.
DAVOS: Not yet.
STANNIS: I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace.
STANNIS: We are alone.
Davos approaches to address Stannis.
DAVOS: Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight.
STANNIS: I am fighting.
DAVOS: By burning prisoners alive?
MELISANDRE: How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?
DAVOS: I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.
MELISANDRE: I'm not your enemy.
DAVOS: You are my enemy.
MELISANDRE: Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.
Melissandre touches Davos's cheek, and he recoils.
DAVOS: ( gasps )
MELISANDRE: Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true.
She whispers in his ear
MELISANDRE:  Death by fire is the purest death.
Enraged, Davos draws his dagger and raises it to stab her. The guard hold him back.
DAVOS: ( growls ) This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.
STANNIS: Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
The guards pull him backwards out of the room
DAVOS: Your Grace!
GUARD: Come on.
MELISANDRE: You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.
DAVOS: She will destroy us all!
MELISANDRE: I will pray for you.
DAVOS: Your Grace!
The guards remove him from the chamber.
EXT. Streets of King's Landing.
Joffrey and Margaery are being transported through King's Landing in their royal palanquin, borne by the Kings guard.
GUARD: Guard: Halt. Down.
GUARD #2: Guard #2: Halt. Down.
The palaquin are set down, and Joffrey is confused and irritated.
JOFFREY: Why have we stopped?
GUARD: It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.
Joffrey looks out of his palquin, and sees Margaery stepping into the streets.
JOFFREY: Joffrey: What is she doing? Who gave her permission?
CUT TO: The nearby streets.
Margaery walks with purpose, and her maid tries to keep up.
MAID: My lady. We should have guards, my lady.
MARGAERY: Why?
Margaery is blocked by a disfigured commoner, who looks at her with disdain. She smiles at him.
MARGAERY: Pardon me.
A woman empties a bucket of feces just in front of Margaery's path. She continues, optimistic and undeterred.
MAID: Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress.
MARGAERY: I have others.
She steps across the puddle of filth and her handmaid follows.
CUT TO: Joffrey's palaquin.
GUARD: Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?
JOFFREY: No.
CUT TO: Margaery sitting in a small courtyard, surrounded by children.
CHILD: He was a soldier. He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay. He never came back.
MARGAERY: And your mother?
CHILD: She died when she had me.
MARGAERY: Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them.
Margaery hands him a toy knight carved from wood.
MARGAERY: Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father.
CHILD: He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.
MARGAERY: And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.
She turns to Child #2.
MARGAERY: Was your father a soldier, too?
Child #2 nods
MARGAERY:  You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you.
Women hand out food to the children.
Cut to: The streets, a little later.
Margaery holds hands with two children as she walks. Children laugh and play. She speaks to their caretaker.
MARGAERY: Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me.
INT. Joffrey's dining table that night
The doors open. Joffrey and Cersei join  Margaery  and Loras  for dinner.
MARGAERY: Your Grace.
LORAS: Your Grace.
They bow.
JOFFREY: Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?
MARGAERY: ( laughs )
JOFFREY: That's a lovely gown, my lady.
CERSEI: Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold.
MARGAERY: The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace.
JOFFREY: Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?
MARGAERY: I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?
LORAS: Yes.
MARGAERY: Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it.
They all sit at the table, and servants begin to pour the wine.
CERSEI: You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
MARGAERY: Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
LORAS: Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
MARGAERY: The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
CERSEI: Cersei: An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life.
JOFFREY: My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
CERSEI: You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery.
There is an awkward pause as the main course is brought to the table.
MARGAERY: Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need.
JOFFREY: Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing.
CERSEI: I'm sure she does.
EXT. Approaching the harbor of Astapor
DAENERYS stands on deck, watching their approach to the city.
CUT TO:  The path leading to Astapor
Kraznys mo Nakloz leads Daenerys, Jorah and Missandei. Missandei translates for Kraznys.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian )
MISSANDEI: The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
They approach the gate.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian )
MISSANDEI: They will stand until they drop.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian )
MISSANDEI: Such is their obedience.
The foursome walks though a battalion of Unsullied warriors, standing at attention, who have made an aisle for them to pass through.
DANAERYS: They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.
MISSANDEI: (speaking Valeryan) The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down. She wished to know how they are trained.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian ) Tell her what she would know and be quick about it.
Once they are through, the Unsullied reform at attention. The four ascend a platform at the end of the yeard, the sea behind them, to survey the soldiers.
MISSANDEI: They begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian )
MISSANDEI: Their discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing.
JORAH: Even the bravest men fear death.
MISSANDEI: ( speaking Valyrian )
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian )
MISSANDEI: ( speaking Valyrian ) The knight says even brave men fear death.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian ) Tell the old man he smells of piss.
MISSANDEI: ( speaking Valyrian ) Truly, master?
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian ) No, not truly. Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing? (Continues in Valyrian)
MISSANDEI: Missandei: My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian ) Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch.
KRAZNYS steps forward and descents to the yard.
MISSANDEI: He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian )
Kraznys calles an Unsullied forward. He pushes the man's shield and spear aside. He takes the Unsullied's knife and cuts away part of his leather chest armor
DAENERYS: Tell the good master there is no need.
KRAZNYS grabs hold of the man's exposed nipple.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian ) She's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?
KRAZNYS slices off the man's nipple, throwing it to the ground. The solder does not flinch.
Missandei: My master points out that men don't need nipples.
KRAZNYS replaces the armor strap, and returns the soldier's arms to the ready.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian ) Here, I'm done with you.
UNSULLIED: ( speaking Valyrian ) This one is pleased to have served you.
KRAZNYS turns around to face DAENERYS. The Unsullied soldier steps back into formation.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian )
MISSANDEI: To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them.
DAENERYS: You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?
MISSANDEI: ( speaking Valyrian ) She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian ) What a soft mewling fool this one is. ( continues in Valyrian )
MISSANDEI: My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother.
DAENERYS: How many do you have to sell?
MISSANDEI: ( Missandei speaking Valyrian )
KRAZNYS holds up eight fingers.
MISSANDEI: 8000
KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ: ( speaking Valyrian ) Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.
MISSANDEI: Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested.
KRAZNYS sheaths the knife. The Unsullied make way for KRAZNYS and MISSANDEI as the exit, then return to formation.
CUT TO: Slaver's Bay shoreline
Daenerys and Jorah walk along the shore.
DAENERYS: 8,000 dead babies.
JORAH: The Unsullied are a means to an end.
DAENERYS: Once I own them, these men ...
JORAH: They're not men. Not anymore.
DAENERYS: Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?
JORAH: Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
They come upon a busy yard where people work and some children play. One CHILD in particular looks at them as she tosses a wooded ball to herself. JORAH and DAENERYS continue into the yard.
JORAH: You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
The child remains just ahead of them. Meanwhile, a dark hooded figure follows behind.
JORAH: You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.
The Child rolls her wooden ball to DAENERYS, who picks it up. The CHILD motions for her to open it. Behind her, the hooded figure draws a knife. He knocks the ball out of her hand before she can twist it open. JORAH grabs the man and wrestles him to the ground, revealing  BARRISTAN SELMY. DAENERYS has been knocked to the ground, and the ball sits inches from her face. It opens, and a chittering, shiny scorpion crawls out and unfolds itself into display. It launches itself at DAENERYS, but is skewered by BARRISTAN's knife before it reaches her. He studies the pierced arachnid
CHILD: ( hisses )
BARRISTAN flicks the scorpion off his knife. The CHILD, whose mouth is now a corrupt shade of green, flees and jumps off the dock to the water. But when BARRISTAN reaches the edge, the CHILD is nowhere to be seen. He sheaths his knife, confused. DAENERYS and JORAH spot the CHILD on the overlook above them before she walks away.
DAENERYS: (to Jorah) The warlocks.
She walks towards BARRISTAN.
DAENERYS: I owe you my life, ser.
BARRISTAN SELMY: The honor is mine, my queen.
He lowers his hood
DAENERYS: You know this man?
JORAH: (Nods.) I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
Barristan approaches.
BARRISTAN SELMY: King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them.
BARRISTAN kneels before her.
I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father. Allow me to join your Queensguard and I will not fail you again.
BARRISTAN lowers his head in deference. DAENERYS considers his offer.
EXT: The woods outside Winterfell
BRAN runs through the woods, holding a bow. He stops, eyes searching. He turns to move again, but a raven startles him as it swoops  past his face and alights in a tree. BRAN steps closer, notches an arrow and takes aim.
JON: Don't think too much, Bran.
Suddenly, JON and ROBB are by his side.
JON: Relax your bow arm.
BRAN carefully lets the arrow fly. It misses and the raven takes flight. JON and ROBB laugh.
NED: And which one of you was a marksman at 10?
BRAN looks to the sky, trying to locate his father's voice.
BRAN: Father?
JOJEN appears next to him.
JOJEN: You can't kill it, you know.
BRAN: Why not?
JOJEN:  Because the raven is you.
EXT: A field in the north
BRAN wakes suddenly and sits up. He was sleeping atop furs  in an open tent. RICKON, in the cart nearby is startled awake by BRAN's movements. Their direwolves, Summer and Shaggydog, stand near them. HODOR leans down to check on BRAN while OSHA sits nearby, sharpening sharpens a stick.
HODOR: Hodor.
BRAN: It's all right, Hodor.
HODOR: Hodor.
OSHA: Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?
BRAN: No, it was the three-eyed raven.
OSHA: He's back.
BRAN: I tried to kill it, but I couldn't. There was a boy.
OSHA: I don't want to hear about it.
BRAN: But you asked.
OSHA: We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.
BRAN: I didn't ask for black magic dreams.
OSHA: I know you didn't, little lord.
Birds screech in the distance. OSHA looks up, concerned at their disturbance.
OSHA: We need to move.
She stands and puts away her knife.
BRAN: We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive.
OSHA: And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?
BRAN: No.
OSHA: Some good he is, then.
OSHA begins to pack up camp.
OSHA: I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off.
INT: Harrenhal chamber
ROBB looks pensively into a fire. TALISA stands nearby.
TALISA: My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds.
TALISA walks over to ROBB and half-embraces him
ROBB: Did you ever think you'd marry one?
TALISA: I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.
ROBB: Never?
TALISA: Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.
They kiss. The chamber door opens and ROOSE BOLTON enters.  ROOSE BOLTON: Pardon me, Your Grace. My queen.
TALISA: Lord Bolton.
ROOSE holds two pieces raven messages, one in each hand.
ROBB: Let me guess which one is the good news.  ROOSE BOLTON: Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
EXT: Harrenhal courtyard
ROBB stands and and CATELYN sits in an archway. CATELYN is dejected.
CATELYN: I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.
ROBB: We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
CATELYN: Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
ROBB does not answer.
CATELYN: Something else?
ROBB: By the time Bolton's bastard-RAMSAY got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And BRAN and RICKON have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages.
CATELYN: Have you received any demands?
ROBB: No.
CATELYN: Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
INT: Dungeon
THEON is bound on an X-shaped cross in a dungeon. Someone drenches him with a bucket of water to wake him. He wakes, shaking, and takes stock of his location. A blurry TORTURER looks on.
THEON: Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
The TORTURER approaches and grabs THEON's hand, roughly.
TORTURER: I want to do this.
The TORTURER thrusts an awl under THEON's finger nail. THEON screams in pain.
EXT: A field in the Riverlands
JAIME and BRIENNE make their way through a hedge. JAIME's hands are bound, and BRIENNE has him leashed.
JAIME: Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
BRIENNE: Yes.
They walk through the field. BRIENNE occassionally pushes JAIME forward.
JAIME: So how shall we pass the time?
BRIENNE: By putting one foot in front of the other.
JAIME: It's going to be a very dull walk.
BRIENNE: I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
JAIME: You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.
BRIENNE: If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman.
JAIME: All the good it's done her.
EXT: Riverlands forrest, a bit later.
JAIME relieves himself on a tree, while BRIENNE looks on.
JAIME: How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
BRIENNE: Not your concern, Kingslayer.
JAIME: It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
BRIENNE: How would you know?
JAIME: Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
She yanks on his leash and they move on.
BRIENNE: Move.
JAIME: Were you pledged to Stannis?
BRIENNE: Gods, no.
JAIME: Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal.
BRIENNE: Shut your mouth.
JAIME: Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you.
BRIENNE: I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king.
JAIME: Sounds like you quite fancied him.
BRIENNE: I did not fancy him.
JAIME: Oh, gods, you did.
JAIME: Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.
BRIENNE yanks on his leash in response.
JAIME: He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
BRIENNE: I'm not interested in foul rumors.
JAIME: Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
BRIENNE grabs the back of JAIME's head and yanks roughly. She puts her face directly in his.
BRIENNE: Shut your mouth!
JAIME: I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love.
A man approaches, leading  a horse.
MAN: Where are you headed, then?
BRIENNE: South. You?
MAN: Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win.
JAIME: No, you really can't.
They both laugh, kindly.
MAN: Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you.
BRIENNE: And you.
The man starts to walk away, but looks back over his shoulder.
JAIME: He knows who I am.
BRIENNE: He doesn't.
JAIME: Maybe you're right.  But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
BRIENNE: We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
JAIME: More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
BRIENNE pushes JAIME forward, and leads him further along in the woods.
INT: King's Landing, Joffrey's Chambers
Joffrey is being fitted by a TAILOR. CERSEI, seated nearby, looks on.
JOFFREY:  Make it tighter here.
CERSEI: That's better. It makes you look very strong.
The TAILOR lays some sample fabric on Joffrey's shoulder. Displeased, Joffrey snatches it away.
JOFFREY: No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.
JOFFREY dismisses the TAILOR.
TAILOR: Yes, Your Grace.
The TAILOR exits.
JOFFREY: Bloody flowers. On the king.
CERSEI: Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
Joffrey tosses the fabric away and moves to his bed to change back into his clothes.
CERSEI: Tell me what you think of her.
JOFFREY: Who?
CERSEI: Margaery.
JOFFREY: She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.
CERSEI: It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent.
JOFFREY: Yes, she is.
CERSEI: Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
JOFFREY: Not to me.
CERSEI: I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
JOFFREY: This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
CERSEI stands.
CERSEI: Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
JOFFREY: She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
CERSEI reaches out to him, but JOFFREY pushes her hand away.
CERSEI: You need to ask yourself
JOFFREY: I don't need to do anything.
The TAILOR returns with a different fabric sample. He drapes it on JOFFREY's shoulder.
JOFFREY: Better. Much better.
INT: Sansa's room in King's Landing
SHAE brushes SANSA's hair as SANSA sits before a mirror.
SHAE: I still don't believe it.
SANSA: He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
SHAE: Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
SANSA: Littlefinger's not in love with me.
SHAE helps SANSA into her dress.
SHAE: Love is not the thing he wants.
SANSA: He's too old.
SHAE: They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or?
SANSA: No.
SHAE: If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me.
SANSA: Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
There is a knock on the door.
GUARD: Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.
SANSA: Send him in.
SHAE opens the door and LORAS enters.
LORAS: Lady Sansa.
SANSA: Ser Loras.
LORAS: My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens. May I escort you to them?
SANSA exits with LORAS, while SHAE watches with concern.
EXT: King's Landing garden
SANSA and LORAS stroll together through the garden, her arm in his.
LORAS:  I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.
SANSA: You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose.
LORAS: Of course I did.
They approach MARGAERY.
MARGAERY: (to a maid)  It's more your color. You take it.
MAID: Thank you.
MARGAERY: (to LORAS) You're such a dear.
LORAS: I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.
SANSA: Thank you, Ser Loras.
LORAS exits. MARGAERY leads SANSA to a patio, filled with maids.
MARGAERY: Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.
They walk to Olenna, who is seated in the patio.
OLENNA: Kiss me, child.
Olenna extends her hand, and SANSA kisses it in greeting.
OLENNA: It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
SANSA: And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant.
OLENNA: Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.
MARGAERY: Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras.
OLENNA: Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
MARGAERY: Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
OLENNA: She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?
SANSA: Lemon cake's my favorite.
OLENNA: So we've been told. (To the SERVANT) Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others.
They move to a table away from the others.
OLENNA: Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
SANSA: I haven't had the pleasure.
OLENNA: No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.
SANSA: I--, I--
OLENNA: You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?
SANSA looks down and doesn't reply.
OLENNA: Has he ripped out your tongue?
SANSA:  Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion
OLENNA: Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?
MARGAERY:  I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
A SERVANT approaches and brings a platter.
OLENNA: Bring me some cheese.
SERVANT: The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.
OLENNA: The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
The SERVANT nods and exits quickly.
OLENNA: Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.
SANSA: My father always told the truth.
OLENNA: Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head.
SANSA: Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
SANSA holds back tears.
OLENNA: Go on.
SANSA regains her compsure.
SANSA: I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.
MARGAERY: She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her.
OLENNA: Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.
SANSA: He's a monster.
OLENNA: Ah. That's a pity.
SANSA: Please, don't stop the wedding.
OLENNA: Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese.
The SERVANT sets down the tray and slips away. SANSA sighs in resignation.
EXT: Riverlands Woods
ROBB's forces move along a path through the woods. The direwolf Grey Wind watches as RICKARD KARSTARK and ROBB watch the men march past.
RICKARD KARSTARK: We're at war. This march is a distraction.
ROBB: My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.  RICKARD KARSTARK: Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
ROBB: No.  RICKARD KARSTARK: Then it's a distraction.
ROBB: My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.  RICKARD KARSTARK: Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference.
ROBB: Have you lost faith in our cause?   RICKARD KARSTARK:  If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.
ROBB: You don't think we can win?  RICKARD KARSTARK:  May I speak my mind, Your Grace?
ROBB:  Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?  RICKARD KARSTARK:  I think you lost this war the day you married her.
TALISA rides past.
EXT: A bit further up the path
CATELYN weaves a wooden circle bound with twine . TALISA rides up and dismounts with the help of a soldier, her mount whinnying.
TALISA: Whoa, whoa.
MAN: Your Grace.
CATELYN: You're afraid of her. And she knows it.
TALISA: I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?
CATELYN: No.
TALISA: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-
CATELYN: You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.
TALISA: You've made them before?
TALISA sits.
CATELYN:  Twice.
TALISA: Did they work?
CATELYN:  After a fashion. I prayed for my son  Bran to survive his fall.
TALISA: (Nods.)
CATELYN: Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering.
TALISA: Which boy?
CATELYN: Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.
TALISA: And he lived.
CATELYN: And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
EXT: North of the Wall
The wildlings march through the mountains. JON and MANCE stop to talk.
MANCE: Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
JON: Yes.
MANCE: You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people.
JON: I understand.
MANCE: Well, how could you understand?
JON:  You want to protect your people.
MANCE: Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?
JON: No.
MANCE: I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth.
MANCE starts walking again.
CUT TO: A crag next to the marching forces.
MANCE and JON join TORMUND, YGRITTE and ORREL. ORREL sits, eyes white, looking up to a raven.
TORMUND: Shouldn't be long now.
JON: What's wrong with him?
MANCE: He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us.
YGRITTE: What, you've never met a warg?
The raven continues to circle overhead.
MANCE: Orell.
ORELL returns to consciousness.
MANCE: Where were you this time?
ORELL:  The Fist of the First Men.
MANCE: What did you see?
ORELL: Dead crows.
EXT: North of the Wall
The Night's Watch march through the snow covered mountains, looking exhausted.
RAST: What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to.
RAST moves ahead. SAM is drained. He falls to his knees. RAST looks back, satisfied. Then GRENN notices that SAM has given up. GRENN and EDDISON TOLLETT walk back to him
GRENN: Hey. Get up, Sam.
SAM: No.
GRENN: Get up.
SAM: I can't.
GRENN: If you stop, you'll die.
EDDISON TOLLETT: 'Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too.
SAM: You don't care.  EDDISON TOLLETT: 'Course we care.
SAM: You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me.
EDDISON TOLLETT: Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow. We didn't want to die.
GRENN: Help me get him up.
GRENN and EDDISON TOLLETT try to help SAM to his feet. RAST comes back to the trio.
RAST: Looks like that piggy is done for.
GRENN: Help us get him up.
RAST: He's slowing us down.
GRENN: Just get him up!
RAST:  Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.
JEOR comes back to see what is happening.
JEOR: What is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right?
GRENN:  Aye, I think so.
RAST: If he can't, we may as well just go without him.
JEOR: That's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me?
SAM: (nods)
RAST: Why should the rest of us-
JEOR: Rast you're responsible for him.
RAST: What am I supposed to do?
JEOR: Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on!
JEOR exits. SAM starts to follow, dazed and exhausted.
RAST:  I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?
They all walk on.
EXT: Woods in the North
BRAN lies sleeping on some furs. A branch snaps in the distance and he wakes with a start. OSHA and Summer are hunched and alert. OSHA has her makeshift spear at the ready.
BRAN: Where's Rickon and Hodor?
OSHA: Looking for food.
BRAN: What's out there?
OSHA creeps forward and then runs into the woods. Summer growls. A young figure approaches. He looks curiously at BRAN. Summer growls more fiercely. From behind him, OSHA places her spearpoint on JOJEN's neck.
OSHA:  Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood.
JOJEN: I'm unarmed.
OSHA: That was poor planning.
JOJEN: My sister carries the weapons.
MEERA appears quietly, slipping a knife to OSHA's throat, creating.a stand-off.
MEERA: I'm better with them. Drop the spear.
OSHA doesn't comply.
MEERA: Drop it.
OSHA releases the spear.
OSHA: If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits.
Summer continues to growl in warning. JOJEN approaches the direwolf.
JOJEN: You must be Summer.
Summer immediately stops growling. JOJEN holds out his hand. Summer sniffs it, and is pleased. The direwolf walks away. JOJEN approaches BRAN.
JOJEN: I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go.
EXT: Riverlands Woods
GENDRY, ARYA and HOT PIE walk through the woods, weapons drawn.
GENDRY: I'm just trying to understand.
ARYA: Would you please shut up about it?
GENDRY: Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
ARYA: I'm not listening.
GENDRY: But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.
ARYA: Shut up.
GENDRY: You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
ARYA: Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?
GENDRY: But you could have ended the war.
ARYA: Where are we going?
GENDRY: North.
They pause in the woods.
ARYA: If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now.
GENDRY: Maybe we already passed it.
ARYA: It's 100 feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather he's a lord. He'll protect us.
They hear some far-away singing.
GENDRY: Could be a minstrel.
ARYA: Shut up.
THOROS: A lion still has claws  HOT PIE:  A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food.
ARYA: Shh.
They crouch to hide behind a broken wall, and watch a handful of men approach. One is singing.
THOROS: And so he spoke, and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains Weep o'er his hall With no one there to hear.
An arrow whistles past the trio, surprising them. It embeds in a tree trunk behind them. They spin to hide out of sight.
THOROS: What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?
ANGUY:  Just a dirty little cub, I think.
THOROS: Loose a few more shafts.
ARYA steps out of hiding.
ARYA: Don't.
THOROS and ANGUY look down at her from the path. THOROS takes a deep drink.
THOROS: Put the sword down, girl.
ARYA: You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.
ANGUY: Generous.
THOROS: You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?
ARYA: What friends?
ANGUY:  The fat to your left and the lad beside him.
Resigned, GENDRY steps out and pulls HOT PIE with him. They ready their weapons. THOROS responds, and his party swiftly comes over the wall to face the trio. They do not draw weapons.
THOROS: Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?
ARYA: Who are you?
THOROS: Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
ARYA: No, who do you fight for?
THOROS:  The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
HOT PIE: I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
THOROS: You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way.
HOT PIE takes a few steps back. ANGUY notches an arrow in response. ARYA, GENDRY and HOT PIE raise their weapons, nervously.
ANGUY: Here's the thing, fat
ANGUY shoots the arrow into the sky.
ANGUY: When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking.
HOT PIE lurches forward two steps. The arrow lands, burying itself where HOT PIE was just standing. THOROS motions for the trio to move with them. Some men chuckle, and then everyone scrambles over the broken wall in turn.
ANGUY: Half the country's starving and look at this one.
THOROS: Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
THOROS follows HOT PIE. ANGUY, pulls his arrow from the tree trunk.
INT: Tyrion's Chambers in King's Landing
TYRION returns to his quarters. SHAE lies waiting for him.
SHAE: My lion.
TYRION: We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
They kiss.
SHAE: But you said I should come to you with any problems.
TYRION: Did anyone see you? No.
SHAE: No.
TYRION: You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
They kiss again.
TYRION: All right. What is this problem?
SHAE:  I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him.
TYRION: Baelish doesn't have friends.
SHAE: I don't know her name.
TYRION: Oh, Ros? The redhead?
SHAE: How do you know her?
TYRION: I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
SHAE: She's a whore.
TYRION: Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.
SHAE: You fucked her.
TYRION: Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice.
SHAE slaps at his chest, playful, and stands up to walk from the bed to pout.
TYRION: But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else.
SHAE: And was she good? Did you like her?
TYRION: Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?
SHAE: That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
TYRION: Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
SHAE: We have to protect her.
SHAE begins to pet him with affection.
TYRION: We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name.
SHAE pushes him again.
SHAE: A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?
TYRION: Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you.
SHAE: You pervert. You want her? This child?
TYRION:  I don't even want to talk about her.
SHAE: But you are.
TYRION: Only because you're making me.
SHAE grabs his chin and looks directly at him.
SHAE: I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
TYRION: This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
SHAE: Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me.
TYRION: Hmm, yes.
They kiss.
SHAE: Now do you think I'm cruel?
She begins to undress him.
TYRION: Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
She kisses him,  loosens his cloths, and kisses him lower.
TYRION: Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
EXT: King's Landing Courtyard
MARGAERY walks through the courtyard, accompanied by guards.
INT: Joffrey's Chambers in King's Landing
JOFFREY sits holding his crossbow. A guard knocks on the door.
GUARD: Lady Tyrell, my king.
JOFFREY: Send her in.
The door opens, and MARGAERY enters.
MARGAERY: You wanted to see me, Your Grace?
JOFFREY:  I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
MARGAERY: That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want.
JOFFREY: Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
She approaches.
MARGAERY: A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
JOFFREY: And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
MARGAERY: Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.
JOFFREY: What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
MARGAERY: The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
JOFFREY: You failed to do this.
MARGAERY: Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace.
JOFFREY: You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
MARGAERY: No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
JOFFREY: What makes you say this?
MARGAERY sits next to JOFFREY.
MARGAERY: Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me.
JOFFREY: No, he was a known degenerate.
MARGAERY: It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.
JOFFREY: Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
MARGAERY: As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
MARGAERY strokes the crossbow.
MARGAERY: You are the king.
JOFFREY: Yes. I am.
JOFFREY looks at his crossbow, a bit excited.
JOFFREY: Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
MARGAERY: It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
JOFFREY:  It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
JOFFREY uses the lever to cock the bow.
JOFFREY: The bolt goes here.
MARGAERY hands him the bolt, daintily. He takes it and arms the bow. He stands, weapon braced at his waist, and looks for a target.
JOFFREY: And then you just aim and
JOFFREY releases the bolt and pierces the head of a stuffed boar. MARGAERY erupts in applause and laughs. She stands.
MARGAERY: Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman.
JOFFREY: It's not unheard of.
MARGAERY:  May I? Please.
JOFFREY hands her the crossbow, and helps MARGAERY into a proper stance. They stand, posed and close.
MARGAERY: I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
JOFFREY: Could you do it? Could you kill something?.
MARGAERY:  I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?
JOFFREY: Yes.
MARGAERY: Would you like to watch me?
JOFFREY: Yes.
INT: Torture chamber
THEON screams as the TORTURER's ASSISTANT turns a huge screw that is planted on his foot.
THEON: Stop! Stop!
TORTURER: Tell us the truth.
THEON: (screaming) About what?
The ASSISTANT turns the screw again.
THEON: I don't know what you want.
TORTURER: I want the truth.
THEON: What truth?
TORTURER: Why'd you take Winterfell?
THEON: I took it to-I took it-
TORTURER: Who gave the orders?
THEON: No one. I took it on my own.
TORTURER: Why?
THEON: To take the North while it was vulnerable.
TORTURER: What were you going to do once you took it?
THEON: Hold it. Rule it.
TORTURER: Good. That's very good.
The ASSISTANT turns the screw again. Blood well ups around it as THEON screams.
THEON: Why did you do that?
TORTURER:  I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
THEON:  I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
The TORTURER approaches.
THEON: (panicking) Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them.
The TORTURER steps even closer.
THEON: What are you doing?
The TORTURER places a hood over THEON's head.
THEON: Please.
The ASSISTANT turns the screw, and THEON screams. The TORTURER walks away, followed by his team. They leave one lowly cleaning boy, RAMSAY, behind.
THEON: I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off.
The door closes shut. RAMSAY removes the hood from THEON. He is surprised.
RAMSAY: Your sister sent me.
THEON: Yara?
RAMSAY releases the pressure on his foot.
RAMSAY: I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
RAMSAY places the hood back onto THEON's head, and leaves.
THEON: No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go.
EXT: The North
HODOR, RICKON, OSHA, Jojan and MEERA walk along a narrow road. HODOR pulls the cart carrying BRAN. The direwolves are nearby. RICKON, runs excitedly down the hill.
OSHA: Rickon, stay with us.
BRAN: It's all right. The wolves will protect him.
BRAN nods to Summer, who turns to follow RICKON. They continue on the path.
JOJEN: You can get inside his head, see through his eyes.
BRAN: Only when I'm asleep.
JOJEN: That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.
BRAN: It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-
JOJEN: A three-eyed raven?
BRAN: You've seen it?
JOJEN:  We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
BRAN: Does it have anything to do with warging?
JOJEN:  No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight.
BRAN: Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
JOJEN:  Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
OSHA: What's he telling him?
MEERA: Why don't you ask?
OSHA:  Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?
MEERA: Where's the shame in that?
OSHA: Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
MEERA: Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
BRAN: When my father died, I dreamt it.
JOJEN: You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.
BRAN: You have the sight, too?
JOJEN: (Nods.) When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.
BRAN: Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
JOJEN: Yeah.
BRAN: He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
JOJEN: Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too.
BRAN: What else have you seen?
JOJEN:  Only one thing that matters-you.
EXT: Riverlands Tavern
The tavern is lively with  drinking and laughing
MAN: I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand.
Nearby, THOROS sits with ARYA, GENDRY and HOT PIE. He pours some ale for ARYA.
ARYA: I don't drink ale.
THOROS: There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
MAN: Yeah!
THOROS: You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-
ARYA: We're not children.
THOROS: How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?
ARYA: Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
THOROS: A smith, eh? Where'd you train?
GENDRY: King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
THOROS: That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
GENDRY: That's because he's twice as good.
THOROS: Aha! A smith and a salesman.
ARYA: Gendry stole us weapons.
THOROS: Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.
ARYA: He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
The men laugh.
ARYA: My brothers taught me.
The men laugh again. ARYA stands to prove herself. She draws her sword and points it at THOROS's throat.
MEN: Ooh!
THOROS looks at the blade, and feints a drink. Instead, he rises, draws his sword and disarms ARYA with a sweeping move of his blade. Surprised, ARYA steps backward, afraid. The men cheer. THOROS takes some dramatic and slightly drunken steps, then relents. He turns to rejoin the table, taking up some ale along the way.
THOROS: To your brothers!
The men cheer. ARYA meekly picks up her weapon and sits back down at the table, next to the silent GENDRY and HOT PIE.
THOROS: You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.
ARYA: You'll free us?
THOROS: I gave you my word.
The trio rises. So does THOROS.  But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-
THOROS is interrupted by the smiling entrance of ANGUY and more brothers, with a large hooded captive. They are proud of their capture.
ANGUY : Hey, hey.
The men cheer.
THOROS: Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
ANGUY: One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
THOROS: Poor man. You have my sympathy.
He removes the hood. The captive is the HOUND. ARYA is worried, and turns away before she can be seen.
THOROS: Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!
The men howl in jest.
THOROS: So good to see you again, Clegane.
HOUND: Thoros? The fuck you doing here?
THOROS: Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.
HOT PIE, GENDRY and ARYA start to leave.
THOROS: A pretty prize, lads.
MEN: Yeah!
The HOUND recognizes ARYA.
HOUND: Girl.
ARYA freezes, then turns to face him.
HOUND: What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
EXT: Riverlands
JAIME and BRIENNE walk along a river and approach a stone bridge.
JAIME:  It's a tough decision-take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
BRIENNE: Silence, Kingslayer.
JAIME: Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river.
BRIENNE: Good luck.
JAIME: It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
CUT TO: The bridge.
BRIENNE and JAIME have chosen the bridge.
JAIME: Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
BRIENNE: Be quick about it.
When they reach the middle of the bridge, JAIME sits down, back to the wall.
JAIME: I need to rest.
BRIENNE: Get up.
JAIME: I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?
BRIENNE: Get up now.
She looks around, feeling nervous and exposed.
JAIME: Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year.
BRIENNE tires of his ploy. He grabs him and tries to make JAIME stand back up.
JAIME: This heel is ruined. There's no way-
JAIME takes his opportunity and grabs BRIENNE's sword from its sheath. He runs as far as he can before the rope stops him. He cuts it with the sword. His hands are still bound, but he measures the feel of the sword, and chuckles.
JAIME:  I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
BRIENNE takes an aggressive stance. JAIME is playful and cavalier, trying to goad BRIENNE into making an ill-conceived move. She remains conservative in her tactics. They take stock of one another.
JAIME: Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
JAIME begins an attack. Their sword clash.
JAIME: You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
JAIME lunges again and pushes BRIENNE back. She counters, but he regains momentum. In a spinning move, they switch places.
JAIME: Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you.
He attacks again. They end with their swords in contest and switch to a game of strength and leverage.
JAIME: You're good. Graceless, but good.
BRIENNE uses her hilt to break the deadlock with an upward thrust of her sword. They face off again. This time, BRIENNE goes on the attack. She gains the advantage, and knees him in the stomach.
JAIME: See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.
JAIME spins to increase the force of his attacking blow, and drives BRIENNE back down the bridge. Their shouldersa collide and they face off once again, panting heavily. JAIME starts a new assault, but BRIENNE parries and gains the upper hand. She punches him in the jaw and he reels to the bridge wall. BRIENNE's next blow misses, but ignites sparks on the wall. BRIENNE grows stronger and confident as JAIME is beaten. Exhausted, he ends up on the ground. A horse neighs just off the bridge, and BRIENNE looks to locate who has joined them. Three mounted men ride out from the woods, with additional forces behind.
LOCKE: Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman.
JAIME: We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
LOCKE: You sure he's the one?
The MAN that JAIME and BRIENNE encountered in the woods  is brought forth.
MAN:  That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.
LOCKE: Give the man his silver.
JAIME: Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
LOCKE: Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours.
The mounted men move forward onto the bridge. BRIENNE and JAIME step backward, with no options available to hold off such numbers.
EXT: Riverrun
ROBB and BRYNDEN TULLY, waist deep in the river, release the funeral boat of HOSTER TULLY. They return to the dock to rejoin the somber and silent CATELYN and  TALISA.  EDMURE steps forward, holding a bow while the others look on. He lights the arrow and fires an arcing shot at the distant boat. The arrow splashes wide of its mark. Perturbed and embarrassed, EDMURE looks back, then draws another arrow to ignite. He shoots, and this arrow also splashes errantly, while the boat drifts further downstream. The large crowd near the dock murmurs. ROBB laughs under his breath and BRYNDEN looks impatient. EDUMRE takes a breath and unleashes a nervous shot that also splashes uselessly. Fed up, BRYNDEN pushes EDMURE aside and takes his bow. CATELYN, ROBB and TALISA try to maintain their composure. BRYNDEN lights an arrow, aims carefully, and unleashes an arcing shot. As the arrow flies, he turns and tosses the bow back to EDMURE, and walks off. Moments later, the arrow lands in the boat, setting it aflame. CATELYN is relieved. BRYNDEN continues to walk away. EDMURE watches as the flaming boat disappears at the river's bend.
INT: Riverrun war room, later
EDMURE: If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing--
BRYNDEN: Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him "nephew." He is your king.
EDMURE: Robb knows I meant him no disr--
BRYNDEN: You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
EDMURE: My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around.
ROBB: It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
EDMURE: I seized an opportunity.
ROBB: What value was the mill?
EDMURE: The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
ROBB: Is he there now? Of course not.
EDMURE: We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
ROBB: I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill.
EDMURE: We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
ROBB: Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.
BRYNDEN: Martyn is 15, I believe.
ROBB: Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
EDMURE: No.
ROBB: Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
EDMURE: No.
ROBB: How many men did you lose?
EDMURE:  But for every man we lost, the Lannisters--
ROBB: We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
EDMURE: I'm sorry. I didn't know.
ROBB:  You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
BRYNDEN: We seem to be running short of patience here.
ROBB: You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
INT: King's Landing, the Small Council chamber.
TYWIN stands by the head of the table. PYCELLE, VARYS, and LITTLEFINGER enter silently. TYRION enters next. TYWIN sits, then PYCELLE, VARYS, and LITTLEFINGER join him. TYRION remains still, while CERSEI enters and surveys the room.  She pauses, then walks to the table. She picks up one of the two remaining empty chairs and places it directly next to TYWIN, then sits while the others smirk. TYRION comes forward, and drags the final chair noisily (and comically) to the opposite head of the table. He sits.
TYRION: Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
TYWIN: What news of Jaime?
No one answers.
TYWIN: 20,000 unwashed northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?
VARYS: We are trying, my lord.
TYWIN:  Try harder. What do we have, then?
VARYS: Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name.
TYWIN:  Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.
LITTLEFINGER: For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.  Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me.
PYCELLE: A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
LITTLEFINGER: Titles do seem to breed titles.
TYWIN: You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
TYRION: Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.
TYWIN: Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
CERSEI: (chuckles)
TYRION: Master of Coin?
TYWIN:  It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
TYRION: I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.
CERSEI: I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
PYCELLE: Hear, hear.
EXT: Riverlands Woods
LOCKE's forces ride through the woods, singing.
MEN: (singing) He lifted her high in the air. He sniffed and roared and smelled her there. She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair. But he licked the honey from her hair. From there to here, from here to there. All black and brown and covered with hair. He smelled that girl in the summer air. The bear, the bear and the maiden fair.
Behind the singing soldiers, BRIENNE and JAIME are bound together, back to back, atop a single horse. JAIME suffers the indignity of facing backwards.
JAIME:  I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us.
BRIENNE: You were armed when we were taken.
JAIME: I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
BRIENNE: All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable.
JAIME: I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
BRIENNE: And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
JAIME: You were not beating me.
BRIENNE: Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
JAIME: When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist.
BRIENNE:  Would I?
JAIME: They'll knock your teeth out.
BRIENNE: You think I care about my teeth?
JAIME: No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?
BRIENNE: What does it matter?
JAIME: Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
BRIENNE: If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?
JAIME:  If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods.
EXT: Riverlands
The camp of the Brotherhood without Banners is bustling. GENDRY helps THOROS to put on his armor. ARYA sits nearby, watching.
GENDRY: If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new.
THOROS: Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
ARYA: Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
THOROS:  You're not our prisoner, little lady.
ARYA:  What am I?
THOROS: Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.
ARYA: So I can walk away, then?
THOROS: These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. ou're lucky we found you.
Arya gets up and walks away, frustrated. ANGUY and some men lead the bound HOUND through the camp.
HOUND: You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?
ANGUY: Better than anyone you've ever met.
HOUND: A coward's weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
ANGUY: Why? So you can kiss him?
ARYA:  You remember the last time you were here?
HOUND: Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
ANGUY places a hood over the HOUND's head.
ANGUY: Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more.
ANGUY helps the HOUND into the wagon, and guides his hooded head to hit the top of the doorway.
ANGUY: (sarcastically) Watch your head. Off we go.
ANGUY pounds the side of the wagon.
DRIVER: Walk up!
ARYA watches the wagon drive away while GENDRY packs up. HOT PIE enters, holding some bread.
ARYA:  What are you doing? We're about to leave.  Hot PIE: I'm staying.
GENDRY: You're what?
HOT PIE:  I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.
ARYA: Winterfell.
HOT PIE:  You sure?
ARYA: I'm sure.  Hot PIE: Well, I made you something.
HOT PIE hands ARYA the bread that he baked. It is shaped like an animal of some sort.
ARYA: What is it?
HOT PIE:  It's a wolf.
GENDRY: Yes, it is.
ARYA:	 That's the tail?
HOT PIE: Yeah.
GENDRY: Well, be safe.
HOT PIE: Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed.
GENDRY: You don't burn your fingers.
GENDRY pats HOT PIE's shoulder, grabs his pack, and exits.
ARYA: Good-bye, Hot Pie.
HOT PIE: Good-bye, Arry.
ARYA walks away and joins a brother on a horse.
MAN: Up you go, little lady.
ARYA takes a bite of the bread as they ride away.
ARYA: Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good.
INT: Riverrun great hall
CATELYN and BRYNDEN gaze out a grand window from within the castle, appreciating the beauty of the Riverlands.
CATELYN: A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
BRYNDEN: It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening.
CATELYN: I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words--
BRYNDEN: Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.
CATELYN: I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
BRYNDEN: After 30 years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name.
CATELYN: Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again.
CATELYN begins to weep. BRYNDEN sits to comfort her.
BRYNDEN: You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him.
CATELYN: (Sighs.)
INT: Riverrun dungeon.
TALISA tends to MARTYN LANNISTER's arm while WILLEM LANNISTER looks on.
MARTYN: You're Robb Stark's wife.
TALISA: Hold still.
MARTYN: Is it true what they say about him?
TALISA: I don't know. What do they say about him?
MARTYN:  That he can turn into a wolf at night.
TALISA: True.
MARTYN: And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
TALISA: True. You're a Lannister, aren't you?
MARTYN: Martyn Lannister.
TALISA: Martyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear.
EXT: North of the Wall
MANCE, TORMUND, JON, YGRITTE and ORELL walk through a winter storm. MANCE kneels down.
MANCE: Always the artists.
The camera pans up to reveal a huge spiral of  horse carcasses, dismembered and frozen in a horrific but almost beautiful.
JON: It's only horses. No men.
YGRITTE: You said there was dead crows.
ORELL: There was.
MANCE: How many men were here?
JON: About 300.
MANCE: And you know what those men are now?
JON: (Nods)
JON: Do you think anyone got away?
MANCE: It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and 20 good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly.
TORMUND: We're finally going to war, old friend?
MANCE: Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side.
MANCE and TORMUND embrace.
TORMUND:  We'll meet again.
MANCE:  Aye.  If you do your job.  Ah.
ORELL: How will we see your signal?
MANCE: Send your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen.
EXT: Craster's Keep, night
The Night's Watch continues its brutal march. They have reached a large farmhouse complex. As they approach, the women scatter and flee. SAM sees the white direwolf nearby.
SAM: Ghost?
They approach the main doorway, led by JEOR and are met by CRASTER.
CRASTER: What have we here? Frozen crows?
JEOR: We've come a long way.
CRASTER: Smaller flock than you went north with.
JEOR: We can talk inside.
CRASTER: Oh, can we?
CRASTER takes stock in silence. The Night's Watch is ready to force their way in, if necessary.
CUT TO: Inside Craster's Keep.
The men sit by the fire in a tense silence. Nearby, a woman wails. Some younger girls observe from the rafters. Women tend to the animals outside.
WOMAN: They need some water.
WOMAN #2: Tether it and I'll be inside.
CRASTER: Keep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you.  Karl TANNER: Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
CRASTER: Aye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man.
JEOR: You are a godly man?
CRASTER: I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods.
The woman continues to wail in another room. Another woman pours some water for CRASTER.
CRASTER: Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. (Pointing to SAM) And she's almost as fat as this one here.  Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.
CRASTER laughs uncontrollably. SAM stands and exits.
CUT TO: Craster's Keep courtyard.
SAM walks outside. He follows the sound of the wailing, and peers into the small hut where GILLY is giving birth.
WOMAN: Here we are.
WOMAN #2: Sharpen these for me, would ya?
WOMAN #3: I see the head. Push.
WOMAN: That's it. You're nearly there. One more push should do it.
The baby comes and the women tend to the newborn.
GILLY: (desperate) What is it? What is it?
GILLY sees that the baby is a boy and her face falls. Then she notices SAM peering in. He exits quickly.
INT: Torture room, night.
THEON is still hooded and strapped to the cross. The door clanks open. RAMSAY enters, removes the hood and starts to undo THEON's bindings.
RAMSAY: Keep quiet.
THEON groans and RAMSEY frees him, and lowers him to the floor. THEON takes a desperate drink of water from the flask that RAMSEY offers. He tries to stand.
RAMSEY: If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.
THEON: I can ride.
RAMSAY: You're sure?
RAMSEY douses the light as they prepare to leave.
CUT TO: Outside.
THEON painfully mounts the house that RAMSAY has procured.
RAMSAY: Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.
THEON: I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
RAMSAY: We're not in the Iron Islands. Go.
THEON rides away.
THEON:  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
EXT. Storm's End shoreline, day.
STANNIS and MELISANDRE walk to the craggy shore where some men hold a boat at the ready.
MAN: Come on back.
STANNIS: You refuse to tell me where you're going?
MELISANDRE: I don't know yet. The fires will show me.
STANNIS:  How long will you be gone?
MELISANDRE: I don't know.
STANNIS: You're abandoning me.
MELISANDRE: I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire.  I am sworn to serve you.
STANNIS:  Then serve me.
MELISANDRE: When I return, you will understand.
MELISANDRE starts to walk away, but STANNIS stops her.
STANNIS: My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.
MELISANDRE: I cannot.
STANNIS: Why?
MELISANDRE: You don't have the strength. It would kill you.
STANNIS: I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.
He clasps her to him.
STANNIS: (whispering) I want you.
MELISANDRE does not respond, and he is disappointed. She looks at STANNIS with concern.
MELISANDRE: Your fires burn low, my king.
He starts to walk away.
MELISANDRE: There is another way. A better way.
STANNIS: You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
MELISANDRE:  Yes.
STANNIS:  I'm the one true king.
MELISANDRE: You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it.
She walks to the boat.
EXT. Astapor
DAENERYS, JORAH and BARRISTAN walk along the shoreline parapet in the bright sun. A series of tortured slaves on crucifixes line the walkway.
BARRISTAN: The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace.
DAENERYS:  To whom?
BARRISTAN: To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
DAENERYS: Give me your water.
JORAH: Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death.
JORAH gives DAENERYS his canteen. She steps up to a bloodied man and offers a drink. He refuses.
DAENERYS: Here, drink.
BARRISTAN: Leave this place, Your Grace. Leave tonight, I beg you.
JORAH: And what is she to do for soldiers?
BARRISTAN: We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
JORAH: Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done.
DAENERYS: The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents.
DAENERYS hands back the canteen, and they continue their walk.
JORAH: How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?
BARRISTAN: Three.
JORAH:  Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?
BARRISTAN: (Shakes his head.)
JORAH: I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead.
DAENERYS: Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?
BARRISTAN: When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him.
JORAH: Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died.
DAENERYS: Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?
BARRISTAN: I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.
DAENERYS: I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.
They approach an impressive round structure with a huge, golden winged statue crouched atop it.
CUT TO: A courtyard of the building
DAENERYS, JORAH and BARRISTAN stand before a raised platform where KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ and GREIZHEN sit and MISSANDEI stands.
MISSANDEI: All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?
DAENERYS: They did not. I want to buy them all.
MISSANDEI: (speaking Valerian) She wants to buy them all.
KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) She can't afford them. The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants.
MISSANDEI: There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?
DAENERYS: Yes. 8,000. And the ones still in training as well.
GREIZHEN: (speaking Valerian) If they fail on the battlefield, they will shape Astapor.
MISSANDEI: Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.
DAENERYS: I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) The slut cannot pay for all of this.
MISSANDEI: Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) Her ship will buy her 100 Unsullied, no more.
MISSANDEI: Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.
KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) And this is because I like the curve of her ass.
MISSANDEI: The gold you have left is worth 10.
KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) What is left will buy her 10. I will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
MISSANDEI: But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.
KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed.
MISSANDEI: The Dothraki you have with you--
KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) I will give her 3 for those.
MISSANDEI:  The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them.
KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?
MISSANDEI: Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied.
DAENERYS has been looking at the young enslaved children who watch from above.
DAENERYS:  I have dragons. I'll give you one.
MISSANDEI: (speaking Valerian)
KRAZNYS looks shocked.
BARRISTAN: You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.
JORAH: Khaleesi, please.
DAENERYS approaches the platform.
KRAZNYS: Three dragons.
DAENERYS:  One.
KRAZNYS:  Two.
DAENERYS: One.
KRAZNYS consults with GREIZHEN.
KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian)
MISSANDEI: They want the biggest one.
DAENERYS:  Done.
KRAZNYS:  Done.
DAENERYS: I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck.
MISSANDEI: (speaking Valerian) She asks that you give me to her, as a present. She asks that you do this now.
CUT TO: outside the courtyard.
DAENERYS strides purposefully. JORAH and BARRISTAN try to keep up.
JORAH: Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army.
BARRISTAN: Aegon Targaryen proved that.
DAENERYS: You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?
JORAH and BARRISTAN nod. DAENERYS walks away and joins MISSANDEI
DAENERYS: Do you have a name?
MISSANDEI: This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.
DAENERYS: Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?
MISSANDEI: No, Your Grace. No family living.
DAENERYS: You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.
MISSANDEI: Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less.
DAENERYS: I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'
MISSANDEI: There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace.
DAENERYS: Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
MISSANDEI: All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it.
DAENERYS: And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.
MISSANDEI: Valar morghulis.
DAENERYS: Yes, all men must die. But we are not men.
INT: Littlefinger's brothel.
ROS kneels at a hidden compartment in the floor. She hands PODRICK a series of ledgers. He admires her assets. She notices.
TYRION: A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
LITTLEFINGER: I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.
TYRION: Not for bastards.
ROS: That's all of them, my lord.
LITTLEFINGER: Thank you, my dear.
TYRION: Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
PODRICK:  Yes, my lord.
PODRICK wheels the ledges away in a cart. ROS exits as well.
LITTLEFINGER: I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
TYRION: Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid.
LITTLEFINGER: You should have him knighted.
TYRION: If only the Master of Coin had such power.
LITTLEFINGER: If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
TYRION: Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding.
LITTLEFINGER: Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.
TYRION: We don't. I did fuck her once.
LITTLEFINGER:  I know.
TYRION:  But we don't.
LITTLEFINGER: I know. But how would the queen get that idea?
TYRION: Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
LITTLEFINGER: Keep a low profile.
TYRION: If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.
LITTLEFINGER: Well, you are richer than I am.
TYRION: Good point.
LITTLEFINGER: They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores.
TYRION: I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie.
CUT TO: The hallway outside Littlefinger's chambers.
TYRION walks into the hall. BRONN is chatting with a prostitute, and PODRICK stands by his wagon.
BRONN: Come on, I'm here later. Come on.
BRONN hops down and follows TYRION. BRONN trails with the wagon.
BRONN: Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading.
TYRION: You think all reading is dull reading.
BRONN: It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
TYRION: The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
BRONN: Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
TYRION: Unless he made it all up, yes.  Podrick, do keep up.
PODRICK:  Yes, my lord.
TYRION:  Podrick.
PODRICK:  Yes, my lord?
TYRION: After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?
They open a door and enter a chamber. GENNA, naked, lies on the bed.
PODRICK: No, my lord.
TYRION:  Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.
BRONN: She's not bad with second-timers, either.
PODRICK: Uh, my lord
GENNA walks over to PODRICK, smiling, and places her hands on him.
TYRION: A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?
TYRION walks further into the chamber, and pushes aside a curtain, revealing the naked MAREI.
TYRION: Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.
MAREI walks over to PRODICK, and begins to help KALYA to undress him.
MAREI: He's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome.
TYRION reveals the acrobatic KAYLA, who crawls to join the other.
TYRION: Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
PODRICK: My lord, I don't even
TYRION:  She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.
KAYLA performs an impressive and seductive back bend for PODRICK.
TYRION: Be back in time for my supper.
TYRION leaves a small purse. BRONN wheels out the cart as he and TYRION exit.
BRONN: Pace yourself, lad.
INT. Tyrion's chambers.
TYRION pours over the ledgers. BRONN wanders through the room, inspecting various objects, not impressed by any.
TYRION: For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.
BRONN: Let me guess. He's not a magician.
TYRION: No.
BRONN:  He's stealing it?
TYRION: Worse, he's borrowing it.
BRONN: What's wrong with that?
TYRION: We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father.
BRONN: Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt.
TYRION: Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.
BRONN: I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
TYRION: Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.
BRONN: And what if I don't?
TYRION: Well, you have to.
BRONN: But what if I don't?
TYRION: This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back.
PODRICK enters.
TYRION: Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?
BRONN: The lad's practically skipping.
TYRION: You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
PODRICK returns the purse to TYRION.
TYRION: Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year.
BRONN: He's a squire. You don't pay him.
TYRION: Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.
PODRICK: They wouldn't take it, my lord.
BRONN: Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
TYRION: Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
BRONN: What did you tell them?
PODRICK: I didn't tell them anything.
TYRION:  What did you do to them?
PODRICK: Lots of things.
TYRION: And they seemed to like these things?
PODRICK: Yes, my lord.
BRONN: Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
TYRION: Only they weren't paid.
BRONN: What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?
TYRION: Is that what you're telling us?  {PODRICK doesn't deny it.
TYRION: Sit down, Podrick.
TYRION grabs some wine. BRONN clears the table and has PODRICK sit.
TYRION: We're going to need details. Copious details.
TYRION pours wine for everyone.
EXT: Hills, morning somewhere
Theon rides at a clip. He looks in anticipation for his sister. An arrow flies past his head, and he gasps. He cannot figure out where the arrow came from. Over the rise, four mounted soldiers appear, galloping towards him. Theon spurs on his mount in panic.
THEON: Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on.
The soldiers close the distance to THEON. His horse jumps a broken wall as he rides into the trees. The soldiers give chase close behind. One swings a mace, and another shoots an arrow that zips past. One soldier veers off from the others into the woods, in an attempt to cut off THEON's escape.
SOLDIER: Ha! Ha!
They continue to fire at THEON. They all must duck to avoid a low branch. The last soldier has succeeded in his shortcut. He charges at Theon and unseats him with a powerful blow from his morningstar. THEON falls to the ground and gasps in pain.. The soldiers surround him, and dismount. THEON tries to get to his feet, but a SOLDIER kicks him back to the ground.
SOLDIER #1: You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?
One soldier places one foot on THEON's head to hold him down. Two others help.
SOLDIER #2: Take off his pants.
They strip down him pants to reveal his ass. THEON squirms in protest.
THEON: No! No! No, no, no!
SOLDIER #3: I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.
THEON: No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!
As the soldier stands above him, an arrow pierces his heart from behind. He staggers and turns, confused.
THEON: No, please! No! No!
A second arrow pierces the soldier's chest, and he falls to his knees. The others realize that they are under attack and start to flee. They are taken down quickly by arrows. THEON looks up, then works up his pants. RAMSAY approaches, bow in hand. The first soldier that he shot is still on his knees, in shock. RAMSAY stops in front of him, and reaches for another arrow.
SOLDIER #2: You little bastard.
RAMSAY notches the arrow, aims at the soldier's head, and executes him. THEON scrambles backwards in fear as RAMSAY approaches him. RAMSAY extends his hand, gently.
RAMSAY: Come, my lord.
THEON grasps his hand, and RAMSAY brings him to his feet.
RAMSAY: You're a long way from home and winter is coming.
They walk away together, THEON limping.
EXT. Riverlands at Night
LOCKE's men have made camp for the night. BRIENNE and JAIME are bound to trees while the men are gathered around a nearby fire.
LOCKE: I'll take the big bitch first. When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off.
LOCKE approahes. Two men help BRIENNE to her feet.
BRIENNE: My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.
LOCKE: Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you.
BRIENNE headbutts one of the four men around her. But with her hands bound, she has no chance. The men hold her and punch her into submission.
MAN: You're only making it worse.
BRIENNE headbutts him again, and gets another series of blows in return.
LOCKE: Take her over there where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.
MAN: Come on!
BRIENNE yells and screams as they lead her away.
JAIME: You know who she is, don't you?
LOCKE: A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big.
JAIME: She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
MAN: I'm gonna cut your throat!
JAIME: They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
LOCKE: I know what they are.
JAIME: Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched.
BRIENNE screams and men yell in the distance while LOCKE processes this information. Then he turns towards his men.
LOCKE: Bring her back here.
MAN: Yes, my lord. Get up.
MAN #2:  Come on.
MAN #3: Come on, on your feet.
LOCKE: Unbesmirched.
JAIME: Not defiled.
LOCKE: Fancy word for a fancy man.
JAIME: I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words.
LOCKE: I bet you did.
The men tie BRIENNE to her tree once again. JAIME looks at her.
BRIENNE: (screams)
LOCKE: Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?
LOCKE: Aye, you have both.
JAIME: Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
LOCKE: Hard to argue with that.
JAIME: Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once.
LOCKE: None of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
MAN: Come on, men.
The men unchain Jaime.
LOCKE: Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.
JAIME: I'm famished, actually.
LOCKE: I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.
JAIME: Well, I do like partridge.
LOCKE helps him up. JAIME groans from his soreness. BRIENNE watches them walk away towards the fire.
LOCKE: Bring the bird over here and the carving knife. Will this work as a table, my lord?
One of the men kick JAIME's knees out from under him. He falls to the ground.
LOCKE: On the stump.
Another man forces JAIME's right hand onto the stump while the others hold him down. LOCKE grabs JAIME's face and draws the large carving knife, then places its point at Jaime's eye.
LOCKE: You think you're the smartest man there is. That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
JAIME:  My father--
LOCKE: And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say 'my father' and that's it, all your troubles are gone.
JAIME:  Don't.
LOCKE:  Have you got something to say?
JAIME does not respond.
LOCKE: Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that.
Locke stands back up, releasing Jaime's face and withdrawing the knife.
LOCKE: Here, this should help you remember.
LOCKE winds up and cleaves the huge knife through JAIME's wrist in a single blow. JAIME looks with disbelief at his severed hand, and then screams in agony.
END CREDITS
EXT. The Riverlands
LOCKE's men ride through the woods. JAIME's rides with them, his servered hand dangling around his neck. He is glassy-eyed and dejected. BRIENNE, her hands bound,  rides next to him with concern.
MAN: How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
LOCKE: Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?
JAIME's horse drifts leftward and JAIME starts to bend and teeter over.
BRIENNE: He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
JAIME falls off his horse, face first into the mud. He grunts and searches  for purchase with his left hand.  Locke halts the party with a signal and dismounts. JAIME struggles to his feet.
JAIME: (desperately) Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please.
One of Locke's men approaches. He opens his canteen, then pours it out on JAIME's filthy head. The men laugh, and BRIENNE is disgusted. LOCKE comes closer.
JAIME: If I die, you won't be getting--
LOCKE: Oh, enough. Here.
LOCKE gives JAIME his canteen. JAIME gulps it down as quickly as he can.
LOCKE: Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
The men laugh, and JAIME doubles over, coughing spitting out the piss. A man comes to help him up. JAIME sees his opportunity, and elbows him in the face and grabs his sword as the MAN falls. LOCKE draws his weapon, as do some of his men. The surround JAIME. The Kingslayer makes some awkward left-handed blows that are easily parried. There are too many of them.  Another man kicks JAIME down from behind, back into the mud.  The men laugh. BRIENNE has had enough.
BRIENNE: Stop!
BRIENNE slides off her horse. JAIME picks up the sword and starts swinging at the men again. BRIENNE kicks down the man who turns to stop her, while JAIME takes a strong punch to the face. BRIENNE is halted by two drawn swords.
MAN: Far enough.
The men encircling JAIME continue to toy with him, landing blows when his back is turned. He falls into the black mud again. LOCKE comes to him, and kicks him repeatedly.  BRIENNE fumes. LOCKE steps on JAIME's left hand until he finally relents his grip on the sword. LOCKE kicks him again, leaving JAIME sprawled in the mud. The fight has left the Kingslayer. LOCKE kneels down and puts his face threatening close to JAIME's.
LOCKE: Do that again and I'll take your other hand.
LOCKE stands and the men pull BRIENNE back to the horses.
MAN: Come on, you.
JAIME lies in the mud, gazing upward. His severed hand rests cruelly beside his head.
INT: KIng's Landing.
TYRION enters VARYS's chambers.
VARYS: Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.
TYRION: I hope we might speak. In confidence.
VARYS: Oh, always in confidence.
VARYS works to open a large crate with a crowbar
TYRION: About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
VARYS: Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.
TYRION: I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to--
VARYS: End your life?
TYRION: I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof.
VARYS: Proof? Will there be a trial?
TYRION: I need to know.
VARYS: I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?
TYRION: I don't know. Do I?
VARYS pauses from his efforts to open the crate.
VARYS: As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts.
TYRION: Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which--
VARYS: You do not possess at the moment.
Varys puts down the crowbar and moves to a basin to wash his hands and freshen up.
VARYS: But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.
VARYS removes the top of the crate. He and TYRION peer in. VARYS protects his nose from the stink. TYRION is aghast.
TYRION: The sorcerer.
The sorcerer lies helplessly in the crate. His mouth has been sewn shut long ago. He mumbles desperately behind his sewn mouth.
VARYS: Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it.
VARYS returns the lid, in spite of the SORCERER's protests.
EXT: Craster's Keep.
GRENN and EDDISON TOLLETT work in the pig sty, shoveling mud and shit.
GRENN: When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling.
EDDISON: Or the shit.
GRENN: They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it.
EDDISON: And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.
GRENN: But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling.
EDDISON: Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day.
RAST stands at the side of the pig sty.
RAST: We need to get out of here.
GRENN: When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.
RAST: The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?
EDDISON: He had no way of knowing.
RAST: We do now. We know what's out there.
GRENN: Craster's been out here surviving.
RAST: So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
EDDISON: We're like the sons he never had.
RAST: Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves.
INT: Craster's Keep
GILLY cradles her baby, who gently fusses.
GILLY: Shh, shh, shh.
GILLY stands anxiously as SAM enters.
GILLY: You woke him.
SAM: I'm sorry. He's beautiful.
GILLY: Shh!
The baby cries, and Gilly soothes him.
SAM: He's beautiful.  Does he have a name?
GILLY: No.
SAM: Are you going to give him one?
GILLY: Why?
GILLY hands SAM the thimble that he gave her when they last saw one another.
GILLY: Here.
SAM: Gilly.
GILLY: You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.
SAM: I wanted you to have it.
GILLY: I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?
SAM doesn't answer.
GILLY: I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
The baby starts to cry loudly. SAM exits.
EXT: Woods, somewhere.
BRAN runs through the woods. A raven caws overhead. BRAN comes upon a godswood. JOJEN appears by his side.
JOJEN: You have to go after him.
BRAN: How?
JOJEN: You know how.
BRAN climbs to the high branches of the godswood until he finds the raven. He balances his way carefully to the raven.
CATELYN: Brandon.
Catelyn appears behind him in the tree.
BRAN: Mother.
CATELYN: How many times have I told you? No climbing.
BRAN: Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me.
CATELYN grabs him roughly.
CATELYN: I want you to promise me. No more climbing.
She shakes BRAN as her voice rises in volume.
CATELYN: Promise me. Promise me! Promise me!
CATELYN shakes him so hard that BRAN looses his footing and he falls from the tree.
BRAN: Mother! Mother!
CATELYN: Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!
CUT TO: Northern Woods at Night.
BRAN wakes suddenly before he hits the ground in his dream. He sits up. JOJEN watches him, wordlessly.
INT: King's Landing
VARYS and ROS speak in his chambers.
VARYS: Is he very large?
ROS: No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was--
VARYS: Extraordinary.
ROS: The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
VARYS: We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
ROS: (nods)
VARYS: What did he do to them?
ROS: I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive.
VARYS: So what did they say?
ROS: They said it was hard to describe.
VARYS pours her some wine.
VARYS: Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
ROS: He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
VARYS: Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?
ROS: He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest.
VARYS: What makes you say so?
ROS: His shipboard inventory.
Ros produces a scroll and hands it to Varys. He opens it.
VARYS: Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
ROS: Former profession.
VARYS: Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
ROS: Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
VARYS: Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
ROS: He's not interested in them, my lord.
VARYS: How do you know?
ROS: Because I'm one of his girls.
VARYS: Prodigies in odd places indeed.
INT: King's Landing, the Sept of Baelor
JOFFREY: Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.
CERSEI: The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably
OLENNA:  There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
CERSEI: There aren't more than 700 people of any importance.
OLENNA: No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats.
JOFFREY: Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.
MARGAERY: (laughs)
JOFFREY: He was wrong. And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?
CERSEI: Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?
MARGAERY: Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace. I'd love to see their tombs, really. It's like taking a walk through history.
JOFFREY: The tomb's just up here.
MARGAERY: This is so exciting.
JOFFREY and MARGAERY exit.
OLENNA: You were married here, Your Grace?
CERSEI: Yes.
OLENNA: Must seem like only yesterday.
CERSEI: Seems like a lifetime ago.
OLENNA: Your husband, was he buried here as well?
CERSEI: No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End.
OLENNA: Such a tragedy.
CERSEI: A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don't mix.
OLENNA: I should say not. My son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.
CERSEI: I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.
OLENNA: All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.
CERSEI: (chuckles)
OLENNA: I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing.
CERSEI: And yet the world belongs to them.
OLENNA: A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.
MARGAERY: (laughs)
CERSEI: The gods have seen fit to make it so.
CUT TO: the tombs
JOFFREY: My father didn't want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.
MARGAERY: I'm glad he did. I'm sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness.
JOFFREY: I couldn't agree more.
They hear the sounds of a shouting crowd outside the Sept.
MARGAERY: Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold. I've spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defense of King's Landing. They adore you.
JOFFREY: Open the doors.
The doors open.
CERSEI: Joffrey. Wait.
JOFFREY and MARGAERY step out of the sept.
WOMAN: Lady Margaery!
WOMAN #2: Lady Margaery!
WOMAN #3: Bless you, Lady Margaery!
MARGAERY waves to the crowd.
WOMAN #4: Lady Margaery!
WOMAN #5: Lady Margaery!
WOMAN #6: Margaery!
WOMAN #7: Long live Lady Margaery!
JOFFREY looks to MARGAERY and she smiles. He joins her in waving.
MAN: King Joffrey!
WOMAN #8: King Joffrey!
WOMAN #9: King Joffrey!
MAN #2: King Joffrey!
MAN #3: Gods bless King Joffrey!
EXT: Somewhere in the North
THEON and RAMSEY ride slowly through the woods.
THEON: How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
RAMSAY: Not far, my lord. Your sister is waiting for you there.
THEON: She sent you to save me?
RAMSAY: Yes. I served them, the men who were torturing you. I did what they told me and waited for the right moment.
THEON: Why would you risk your life for me?
RAMSAY: I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord. I was only a boy when they took you away. My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off. I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, 'That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son.' And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you.
THEON: Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me. Did he?
CUT TO: The woods, a bit later.
THEON and RAMSAY leap over a wall and move furtively along it in the rain. They approach a small castle.
THEON: My sister's men are loyal to her. We don't need to hide from them.
RAMSAY: Not all those are your sister's men. Some of them are loyal to your father.
RAMSAY opens the lower gate leading into the castle. It leads to a long hallway.
THEON: (chuckles)
RAMSAY:  What is it?
THEON: I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.
RAMSAY: What did he tell you to do?
THEON: Raid fishing villages. He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark. Ha. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
RAMSAY: He lorded it over you?
THEON: Didn't have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He's the King in the North.
They reach another gate. RAMSAY works to open it with his keys.
THEON: And me my father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that's what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys.
RAMSAY finally has worked the gate open.
RAMSAY: The Stark boys?
THEON: Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud.
RAMSAY: Maybe it's not too late.
THEON: It is. My real father lost his head at King's Landing. I made a choice and I chose wrong. And now I've burned everything down.
RAMSAY: Not everything, my lord. She's up here.
THEON and RAMSAY continue past the gate and through somedoors. The room is black.
THEON: Yara.
RAMSAY: Shh. Wait.
RAMSAY lights a torch. The room brightens to reveal the X-shaped cross on which Theon had been tortured.
RAMSAY: I brought him back. He killed the others.
THEON is stunned.
THEON: What? No, I didn't.
Some guards appear behind THEON. One grabs his shoulder, spins him and punches him in the gut.
THEON: You can't! No, please stop! No!
The two guards wrestle THEON back onto the cross. He sobs and yells.
RAMSAY: Put him back where he belongs.
RAMSAY smiles. THEON screams.
EXT. The Riverlands
LOCKE's men continue their ride. JAIME is half-conscious. BRIENNE tries desperately to think of a plan.
CUT TO: The Riverlands, that night.
BRIENNE sits, bound and thinking, her brow still furrowed.
BRIENNE: Eat. What are you doing?
JAIME: I'm dying.
BRIENNE: You can't die. You need to live to take revenge.
JAIME: I don't care about revenge.
BRIENNE: You coward. A little misfortune and you're giving up.
BRIENNE: You lost your hand.
JAIME: My sword hand. I was that hand.
BRIENNE and JAIME sit in silence. JAIME reaches for the bread and takes a bite.
BRIENNE: I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me?
JAIME doesn't answer.
INT: King's Landing, Tywin's chambers.
TYWIN writes while CERSEI looks on, impatiently.
TYWIN: You wanted to speak to me?
CERSEI: Yes, about Jaime.
TYWIN: What about him?
CERSEI: I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.
TYWIN: When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response?
CERSEI: You started a war.
TYWIN: And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?
CERSEI: Whatever you can.
TYWIN: Whatever I can.
Tywin seals the letter he finished, and starts another one.
TYWIN: You're still here.
CERSEI: Yes.
TYWIN: Why?
TYWIN: All right. Contribute.
CERSEI: The Tyrells are a problem.
TYWIN: The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives.
CERSEI: Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him.
TYWIN: Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are. You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
TYWIN goes back to writing.
CERSEI: Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.
TYWIN: I will.
EXT: King's Landing Garden
OLENNA sits thinking.
MAID: Do you like it, Nana?
OLENNA: Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. 'Growing strong.' Ha! The dullest words of any house. 'Winter is coming!' Now that's memorable. 'We do not sow.' Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong--ha, that strikes fear in the heart.
VARYS approaches.
OLENNA: Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong.
The maids exit and VARYS arrives.
VARYS: My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.
OLENNA: The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?
VARYS: A little obvious, perhaps.
OLENNA: Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. So?
VARYS: Might I sit?
OLENNA: No. Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you've sought me out.
VARYS: You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
OLENNA: Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl.
VARYS: Is she?
OLENNA: No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood.
VARYS moves to leave.
VARYS: She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.
OLENNA: Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.
CUT TO: Another part of the garden.
Varys and Olenna walk together.
VARYS: I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.
OLENNA: Which is Sansa Stark?
VARYS: Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.
OLENNA: Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?
VARYS: I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.
OLENNA: How?
VARYS: You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
OLENNA: That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
VARYS: Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.
OLENNA: It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.
VARYS: Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.
OLENNA: And why have you come to me with this matter?
VARYS: Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?
OLENNA: (laughs)
VARYS: Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North.
OLENNA: And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.
VARYS: Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
OLENNA: You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.
VARYS: Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.
OLENNA: You are a clever man, Lord Varys.
VARYS: You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.
OLENNA: One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's all rather obvious, isn't it?
EXT: King's Landing shoreline.
SANSA kneels at a rocky overlook, praying. MARGAERY approaches.
MARGAERY: Ahem. I didn't mean to disturb you.
SANSA: You haven't.
MARGAERY: We'd like some privacy, please. If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself.
The two guards leave.
MARGAERY: What did you pray for?
SANSA: I can't tell you.
MARGAERY: Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning. Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?
SANSA: I'm sorry, I just can't.
MARGAERY: My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. Pig-face, she called me.
SANSA: Pig-face? That's ridiculous.
MARGAERY: I think it had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink.
SANSA: (laughs)
MARGAERY: So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague.
SANSA: Porridge plague?
MARGAERY: You don't have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.
SANSA: But that's awful.
MARGAERY: (nods, laughs)
MARGAERY: Don't say that. No, you're not.
SANSA: So what happened to Alanna?
MARGAERY: Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It's all terribly frustrating.
They arrive at another overlook.
SANSA: I'm sure she's jealous of you now. You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.
MARGAERY takes both of SANSA's hands.
MARGAERY: I want us to be friends, good friends.
SANSA: That would make me very happy.
MARGAERY: You must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months.
MARGAERY: The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras. . .  Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that?
SANSA: (nods)
EXT: Craster's Keep, night
A funeral pyre  blazes in the night.
EDDISON: Down White Harbor way.
JEOR: He came to us from White Harbor. Never failed in his duty. He kept his vows the best he could. He rode far, fought fiercely. We shall never see his like again.
ALL: And now his watch has ended.
JEOR: And now his watch has ended.
JEOR exits.
GRENN: Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.
RAST: It wasn't his foot that killed him. That bastard Craster starved him to death.
SAM: Craster's got his daughters to feed.
RAST: You on his side?
SAM: We can't just show up and steal all his food. We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves.
RAST: The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow. He's a bloody wildling is all he is.
EDDISON: Never knew Bannen could smell so good.
The pyre burns.
INT: Craster's Keep, later.
CRASTER eats and JEOR writes.
CRASTER: You have one son, don't you, Mormont? I had my 99th. You ever meet a man with 99 sons?
JEOR: (shakes his head)
CRASTER: And more daughters than I can count.
JEOR: I'm glad for you.
The night's watchmen return to warm themselves, including SAM, GRENN, EDDISON, RAST and KARL TANNER.
CRASTER: Are you now? Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone.
JEOR: As soon as our wounded are strong enough.
CRASTER: Ah. They're as strong as they're gonna get. Them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it? Hmm? Or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself.
KARL TANNER: Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?
JEOR: Wait outside.
KARL TANNER: It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.
CRASTER: My wives gave you bread.
KARL TANNER: There's sawdust in the bread.
CRASTER: You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow.
KARL TANNER: I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.
JEOR stands.
JEOR: I told you to wait outside.
RAST: He's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die.
CRASTER stands in rage.
CRASTER: I gave you crows enough. I've got to feed my women!
RAST: So you admit you've got a hidden larder, then? How else'd you make it through winter?
JEOR: Enough! Out!
CRASTER: I am a godly man.
RAST: You're a stingy bastard!
CRASTER grabs an ax from the wall approaches KARL TANNER.
CRASTER: Bastard? Out with you, you little thief. And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies. I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard.
JEOR grabs RAST and forces him to exit.
KARL TANNER: You are a bastard. A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.
CRASTER raises his ax and attacks KARL TANNER.  KARL grabs his arm and stabs him in the belly. CRASTER gurgles and chokes.
JEOR: The gods will curse us for this. By all the laws--
KARL TANNER hits one of CRASTER's wives. He then picks her up from the ground, and she does not resist. He puts his knife to her throat.
KARL TANNER: There are no laws beyond the Wall. Now show us where he hides the food or you'll get the same as he did.
JEOR draws his sword.
JEOR: Unhand her.
KARL TANNER drops the woman and gets ready to face off with JEOR.
JEOR:  I shall have your head for this.
RAST stabs JEOR from behind. JEOR's hands go weak, and he drops his sword. GRENN charges KARL TANNER, and they wrestle for control of the knife. Women and men shout as the fight escalates. JEOR turns to face RAST, grabs him by the throat, lifts and pins him against a post. SAM flees to the outside and picks up a sword amidst the chaos. CRASTER lies dead on the floor. JEOR continues to choke RAST, until he suddenly spits up a mouthful of blood, and collapses to the floor. RAST comes to him and savagely stabs JEOR again and again.
CUT TO: Gilly's quarters
SAM enters.
SAM: Quickly. Quickly.
GILLY: What's happening? I'm not going out there.
SAM: No, we have to go. Now!
The baby cries, and they leave the hut to meet the chaos.
GILLY: Follow me. I know the best way. Come on.
GILLY and SAM run from the keep, into the woods.
RAST: Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well! I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights.
EXT: The Riverlands
The Brotherhood without Banners rides through the woods. A hooded ARYA rides with THOROS. They pass a series of men serving as lookouts
ARYA: Can I take this hood off yet?
THOROS: I do apologize, little lady, but it's better for you if you don't see where we're going.
MAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
They hail the lookouts.
MAN: Halt!
THOROS lifts ARYA's hood to reveal her mouth and offers her a drink.
ARYA: What is it?
THOROS: Blackstrap rum.
He lets he smell it.
ARYA: Ugh!
THOROS: Not easy finding molasses in wartime.
Nearby, GENDRY is also hooded.
GENDRY: I'd have some.
THOROS: Let's go home.
CUT TO; The mouth of a cave. The Brotherhood enters, single file, leading the hooded GENDRY, ARYA and the HOUND. They reach the main chamber and remove the hoods.
GENDRY: What is this place?
THOROS: Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
HOUND: You look like a bunch of swineherds.
ANGUY: Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
HOUND: You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
BERIC enters.
BERIC: No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
HOUND: Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
BERIC: And I won't see them again.
HOUND: Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.
BERIC: Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are 1000 miles from home. Which of us is running?
HOUND: Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
BERIC: Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
HOUND: Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.
The HOUND spits in disgust.
HOUND: You're fighting for ghosts.
HOUND: You found god? Is that it?
BERIC: Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
HOUND: If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.
THOROS: You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice.
ANGUY: And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched.
HOUND: I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.
THOROS: House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
HOUND: Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
ANGUY: Murder is a crime.
HOUND: I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not.
ARYA: You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was 12 years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
HOUND: Aye, he was a bleeder.
BERIC: You don't deny killing this boy?
HOUND: I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.
ARYA: That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
HOUND: Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.
BERIC: You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat.
HOUND: So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?
BERIC: Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.
EXT: Astapor
A pair of great doors open. DAENERYS, MISSANDEI, JORAH and BARRISTAN enter the large and bustling courtyard, populated by guards and townfolk. Two guards move through the square, carrying a litter containing one of DAENERYS's dragons.
KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian)
MISSANDEI: The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price.
KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian)
They come to the massive field where the thousands of Unsullied stand at attention. KRASZYS and GREIZHEN stand before them.
MISSANDEI: And who knows? In 10 years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper.
DAENERYS walks back to the woven crate containing her dragon. She opens the front and Drogon comes out, scrreching. DAENERYS holds onto the chain attached to the dragon's foot as it takes flight and hovers above her. She hands the chain to KRAZNYS, who struggles against the strength of the small dragon. He smiles greedily, and hands her the whip that represents command of the Unsullied.
DAENERYS: Is it done, then? They belong to me?
MISSANDEI: (speaks Valyrian)
KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) It is done.
MISSANDEI: It is done.
KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) She holds the whip.
MISSANDEI: You hold the whip.
KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) The bitch has her army.
DAENERYS turns slowly and walks to the unsullied. DROGON's unhappy screeching increases
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Unsullied!
The Unsullied come to attention. MISSANDEI is surprised that DAENERYS speaks Valyrian. KRAZNYS struggles against the dragon.
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Forward march!
The Unsullied march.
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Halt!
The Unsullied halt. KRAZNYS tries to control the dragon.
KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) Tell the bitch her beast won't come.
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) A dragon is not a slave.
KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) You speak Valyrian?
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old  Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue.
DAENERYS turns to the Unsullied.
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see!
An Unsullied pierces a slave master though the heart with his spear. KRAZNYS looks on in panic.
KRAZNYS: (speaks Valyrian) I am your master.
BARRISTAN draws his sword as the Unsullied follow DAENERYS's command.
KRAZNYS: (screaming Valyrian) Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!
DAENERYS: Dracarys.
Drogon unleashes his fire breath, consuming KRAZNYS, who screams in agony as he burns. The Unsullied attack and quickly overwhelm the guards. Drogon flies free, spouting fire above the courtyard.
CUT TO: The courtyard, later.
The courtyeard is filled with smoke and charred bodies. JORAH surveys the carnage and reaches DAENERYS. She walks forward to inspect he Unsullied, who are back in formation. She mounts a white horse, and rides among them.
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?
One Unsullied begins tapping his spear rhythmically in the sand. Soon others join him, and more still until the sound becomes thunderous and unanimous. JORAH and BARRISTAN look on.
CUT TO: Outside the yard.
DAENERYS rides away from the main gate with her Dothraki and  with MISSANDEI, JORAH and BARRISTAN. The 8000 Unsullied march behind her. She tosses away the whip. The three dragons fly overhead.
INT: Riverlands, the caverns of the Brotherhood without Banners
THOROS looks into the fire.
THOROS: Lord, cast your light upon us.
MEN: Lord of Light, defend us.
ANGUY unbinds the HOUND
THOROS: Show us the truth. Strike this man down if he is guilty. Give strength to his sword if he is true. Lord of Light, give us wisdom. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
MEN: For the night is dark and full of terrors.
The HOUND readies his sword and loosens for battle. BERIC kneels before THOROS. BERIC offers his left hand, and THOROS slices open a long gash in his palm. He then places the sword in BERIC's right hand. BERIC slides the blade across the open wound and the weapon erupts in flame.  The HOUND is taken aback. Both men take up shields and they set to battle. BERIC gets first advantage, with the flames putting fear in the eyes of the HOUND. The HOUND finds his rhythm and the battle becomes more even. BERIC  dodges a blow and shoulders the HOUND to stumble into a fire, sparks erupting. The HOUND is enraged, and makes a poorly chosen charge. He ends up on his knees.
THOROS: Get back.
THOROS pushes ARYA away as the fight comes close to them. The HOUND regains his footing and begins a brutal onslaught, shattering BERIC's shield. BERIC stumbles and regroups, pushing the HOUND back with a series of two-handed swings. The HOUND falls onto his back, and BERIC's blow set his shield aflame. The HOUND launches a wild counter attack while the crowd becomes more excited, and begins to chant.
MEN: Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
The HOUND tries to douse his shield, but it continues to burn.
ARYA: Kill him!
After parrying blows, the HOUND elbows BERIC in the gut. He stumbles backwards.
HOUND: (shouts)
The HOUND unleashes an overhead swing with all his might. BERIC blocks with his flaming sword, but the HOUND's powerful blow breaks the blade and cleaves deeply into BERIC's shoulder and torso. BERIC's eyes roll, and he falls to the ground, dead. ARYA is distraught and THOROS launches himself onto BERIC.
THOROS: Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished. Restore it.
HOUND: (shouts)
The HOUND falls to the ground and smashes his shield to the ground, trying to choke the flames.
THOROS: For the night is dark and full of terrors. Lord, cast--
ARYA  spins backwards and takes a man's knife.
GENDRY: Arya, don't!
THOROS: Bring him back from death and darkness
ARYA runs towards the HOUND, but GENDRY intercepts her and tackles her off of her feet.
ARYA: No! ARYA: Let go of me! Let me go!
From the ground, the HOUND taunts her.
HOUND: Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy.
ARYA: Burn in hell!
BERIC: He will. But not today.
BERIC kneels by the fire, resuscitated, bitter and humbled.
EXT: The North, the bustling wildling camp.
JON and YGRITTE bring firewood. TORMUND sits as ORELL greets them with disdain.
TORMUND: Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know.
ORELL: How often do these patrols go out?
JON: It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.
ORELL: You'd like to know that.
TORMUND: (sighs)  There are 19 castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned?
JON: Three.
ORELL: You sure of that?
JON: (nods)
ORELL: Which three?
JON: Castle Black.
ORELL: Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?
JON: Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
TORMUND: How many men remain in Castle Black?
JON: 1,000
ORELL: Liar.
Jon drops his bundle and steps towards Orell.
JON: What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?
YGRITTE: He's no crow.
ORELL: Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.
YGRITTE draws her dagger.
YGRITTE: I'm not afraid of you.
Tormund stands  throws Orell to the ground. He faces Jon.
TORMUND: I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat.
JON: 1000 men
Orell stands up.
TORMUND: We'll find out soon enough.
TORMUND walks away. JON and YGRITTE  walk, quick and agitated, through the camp.
JON: I don't need you to protect me.
YGRITTE: Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.
YGRITTE takes JON's sword and starts to run. JON gives chase.
JON: Give it back.
She stops by the fire and picks up a torch.
YGRITTE: Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back.
She turns and runs. JON runs after her. YGRITTE does not heed his cries.
JON: Ygritte! Ygritte!
YGRITTE reaches a cave. She looks back and smiles before entering.
JON: Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!
INT: The cave.
JON chases YGRITTE into the cave. YGRITTE leans his sword against a rock by a large pool. Water falls in a sheet from above. She puts down the torch, then removes her bow.
YGRITTE: Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.
She takes off her shoes.
JON: Ygritte.
YGRITTE: You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me.
She removes her furs, and then her tunic and pants, revealing herself, nude.
YGRITTE: All of me.
JON is dumbfounded. She walks to him, intensely.
JON: We shouldn't.
YGRITTE: We should.
YGRITTE tries to kiss JON. He resists her at first, but he cannot fight his feelings. They embrace and passionately kiss.  He kisses her neck, her breasts and continues downward.
YGRITTE: Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno--
YGRITTE moans.
INT: The cave, later.
JON lies restfully. YGRITTE sits up behind him.
They embrace and caress..
JON: I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
YGRITTE: Hmm.
JON: You seemed to like it.
YGRITTE: Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?
JON: There's been no one else. Only you.
YGRITTE: A maid. You were a maid.
JON: I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
YGRITTE: What do you think?
JON: Who was he?
YGRITTE: Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.
JON: Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund--
YGRITTE sits astride JON.
YGRITTE: I'm not done with you yet.
THEY kiss.
YGRITTE: How long's it been since you had a bath?
YGRITTE hops up and jumps into the pool beside the cascading water.  Jon joins her, and they kiss again.
YGRITTE: Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever.
They kiss again.
INT: Riverlands, the Brotherhood's cave.
HOUND: I want my gold.
THOROS: It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.
HOUND: Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.
The HOUND throws down the note.
ANGUY: We're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.
HOUND: Come try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass.
The HOUND walks towards ANGUY but THOROS holds him back.
ARYA: You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.
BERIC: Not in the eyes of god.
ARYA: You can't!
BERIC: Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.
ANGUY tossed the HOUND his swords.
BERIC: Go in peace, Sandor Clegane. The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.
A MAN places a hood over the HOUND's head and leads him out.
EXT: Harrnehal
MAN: Riders coming through!
The gates open to a courtyard and LOCKE's men ride in. BRIENNE looks at JAIME, who sits withered astride his mount.
MAN: The Kingslayer.
One of LOCKE's men forces BRIENNE and JAIME to kneel in the courtyard.
MAN #2: Down!
LOCKE: On your knees. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.
LOCKE pushes JAIME down with his foot. JAIME falls on his face, without resistance. JAIME groans.  Roose BOLTON: Pick him up, Locke.
Locke picks up Jaime with the help of one of his men.  Roose BOLTON: You've lost a hand.
LOCKE: No, my lord, he has it here.
LOCKE taunts JAIME with the dismembered hand tied around his neck. ROOSE pulls the hand from around JAIME's neck and hands it to LOCKE.  Roose BOLTON: Take this away.
LOCKE: Send it to his father?  Roose BOLTON: You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.  Roose BOLTON: Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now.
BRIENNE is cut free.
BRIENNE: Thank you, my lord.  Roose BOLTON: Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later.
ROOSE starts to walk away.
JAIME: Lord Bolton.
ROOSE turns around.
JAIME: Is there word from the capital?  Roose BOLTON: You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
JAIME falls to his knees in relief.
ROOSE: Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
His men pick JAIME up, and lead him and BRIENNE away.
INT; Harrenhal, Qyburn's workspace.
QYBURN tends to JAIME's, and he winces and groans. His severed wrist is wet and disgusting.
JAIME: Will I die?
QYBURN: No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
JAIME: Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
QYBURN: The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.
JAIME chokes QYBURN to make his point, then relents.
JAIME: I don't need my right hand to kill you.
JAIME: Mmm.
QYBURN: With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy.
JAIME: No milk of the poppy.
QYBURN: There will be pain.
JAIME: I'll scream.
QYBURN: Quite a bit of pain.
JAIME: I'll scream loudly.
QYBURN straps and buckles JAIME's arm to staunch the bleeding. JAIME suffers and screams as QYBURN snips away the corruption.
EXT: KIng's Landing.
LITTLEFINGER walks into a courtyard, where CERSEI awaits.
CERSEI: Lord Baelish.
LITTLEFINGER: Your Grace.
CERSEI: I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
She walks with him.
LITTLEFINGER: Of course, Your Grace.
CERSEI: I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
LITTLEFINGER: I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
CERSEI: My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
LITTLEFINGER: Myself, I often find them a hindrance.
CERSEI: And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.
LITTLEFINGER: I shall do my best.
CERSEI: Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
LITTLEFINGER: I assure you that it will.
CERSEI exits.
INT: King's Landing, Tyrion's chambers.
Podrick pours wine for Tyrion and Olenna.
OLENNA: Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern.
PODRICK: Pardon, my lady.
OLENNA: No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
PODRICK extis.
TYRION: Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.
OLENNA: I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
TYRION: It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
OLENNA: Naturally.
TYRION: It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
OLENNA: What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
TYRION: I understand that.
OLENNA: Good.
TYRION: But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense.
OLENNA: And?
TYRION: And we're at war, Lady Olenna.
OLENNA: Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.
TYRION: Yes, and maintaining supply lines--
OLENNA: I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, 12,000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? 2,000 in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. 20,000 head of cattle. 50,000 sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them.
TYRION: And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
OLENNA: As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?
TYRION: I would.
OLENNA: And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
TYRION: (nods)
The door opens and PODRICK returns with figs.
OLENNA: I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?
TYRION: My lady--
OLENNA: Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?
TYRION: Quite sufficient. Thank you.
OLENNA: Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.
TYRION and OLENNA stand, and she exits.
TYRION: Give me that.
TYRION takes a fig from PODRICK's tray.
INT: Riverlands, the Brotherhood's cave.
GENDRY works on BERIC's armor.
ARYA: What are you doing?
GENDRY: Just mending Lord Beric's armor.
ARYA: Why?
GENDRY: I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
ARYA: Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet.
GENDRY: The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
ARYA: You don't have to do this.
GENDRY: I want to. They need good men.
ARYA: Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you--
GENDRY: What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving.
ARYA: You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
GENDRY: He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family.
ARYA: I can be your family.
GENDRY: You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady.
ARYA exits.
INT: Riverrun
WILLEM and MARTY lie sleeping. There are sounds of a battle outside their cell. MARTYN shakes WILLEM to wake him
MARTYN: 'Willem. Willem!
The door bursts open, and RICKARD KARSTACK runs the guard through with his sword. He and his men enter.
WILLEM: Is this a rescue? Rickard KARSTARK: Lannister filth! Take him!
KARSTARK's men take WILLEM.  MARTYN  Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please--
RICKARD KARSTARK stabs MARTYN in the gut
INT: Riverrun
WILLEM and MARTYN lie dead on a blanket. TALISA kneels beside them and ROBB stands beside her. BRYDEN stands opposite, while CATELYN sits behind them.
ROBB: Bring them in.
Brynden opens the door.  RICKARD KARSTARK and his men walk in, hands bound.
ROBB: Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
RICKARD KARSTARK: Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance.
ROBB: Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen--
RICKARD KARSTARK: Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
ROBB: They were boys! Look at them.
RICKARD KARSTARK: Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
ROBB: My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
RICKARD KARSTARK: It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?
Brynden punches Rickard Karstark
ROBB: Leave him.
RICKARD KARSTARK: Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
ROBB: Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
MAN: Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards.
ROBB: This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
MAN: Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!
BRYNDEN takes out RICKARD KARSTARK and men. ROBB sits at his table. TALISA and EDMURE approach.
EDMURE: Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.
ROBB: Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
EDMURE: It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
ROBB: I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die.
CATELYIN stands and approaches.
CATELYN: The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
TALISA: Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.
ROBB: You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
TALISA: And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.
CATELYN: Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
EDMURE: A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed.
ROBB coniders.
EXT: Riverrun gards, later. Rain pours down.
Men bring out the bound RICKARD KARSTARK. ROBB appraoches.
ROBB: That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.
RICKARD KARSTARK: I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
ROBB: Kneel, my lord.
RICKARD KARSTARK willingly leans over the table, before ROBB, who holds a great sword,
ROBB: Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?
RICKARD KARSTARK: Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.
ROBBB beheads RICKARD KARSTARK with a single great blow. He walks away, conflicted and frustrated.
INT: RIverrun, the Brotherhood's caverns.
ARYA stands by the fire. THOROS lies nearby.
ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
THOROS: At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
ARYA: I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
THOROS: Don't think of it that way.
ARYA: But it is that way.
THOROS: It is. And it isn't.
ARYA: More is than isn't.
THOROS: Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.
ARYA: So why don't you?
THOROS: We need the gold.
BERIC enters and sits. ARYA looks uncomfortable.
BERIC: Do I frighten you, child?
ARYA: No.
BERIC: You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
ARYA: I thought he killed you.
BERIC: He did.
ARYA: But how?
BERIC: Thoros how many times have you brought me BACK?THOROS: It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
BERIC: How many times?
THOROS: Five, I think. No, this makes six.
BERIC: Six.
BERIC shows ARYA  the scar on his chest.
BERIC: Then I was stabbed in the belly.
THOROS: Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.
BERIC: Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
THOROS: Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
BERIC shows ARYA his right eye, sewn shut behind his eye patch.
THOROS: And the Hound makes six.
BERIC: Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.
THOROS: You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know.
BERIC: I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away.
ARYA: Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
THOROS: I don't think it works that way, child.
BERIC: He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him.
ARYA: I would. You're alive.
INT: Dragonstone.
SELYSE prays with palms open to a fire in a roughly hewn room.
SELYSE: Lord, cast your light upon me. Protect me in the darkness. Burn away my sins. Help me serve you. Use me as you will. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
The door opens and STANNIS enters. He stands at the threshold, silently. t
SELYSE: I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
STANNIS: My lady.
SELYSE nods in greeting.
STANNIS: I meant to come sooner. The battle--
SELYSE: I know of your troubles, My king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
STANNIS: Yes, of course.
SELYSE: You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.
STANNIS: I believed that once.
SELYSE: You are the one god's champion and the finest man I've ever known.
STANNIS: Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
SELYSE: No.
STANNIS: I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
SELYSE: You're doing god's work.
SELYSE: I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy.
SELYSE walks past STANNIS toward three specimen jars. Each contains a stillborn baby in a cloudy, green liquid.
STANNIS: That's not true.
SELYSE: So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.
STANNIS: She's my daughter. I want to see her.
SELYSE: You are a king. You don't need my permission.
Stannis exits.
CUT TO: The hallway.
STANNIS walks up to another closed door. SHIREEN sings behind it.
SHIREEN: (sings) Under the sea I know, I know/ Oh, oh, oh
CUT TO:  Inside SHIREEN's room.
SHIREEN lies below a shuttered window. Sounds of seabird and crashing surf waft through the room.
SHIREEN: (sings) The birds have scales  / And the fish take wing / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh
STANNIS: Shireen.
SHIREEN: Father!
SHIREEN rushes up and hugs STANNIS. He sighs and does not return his embrace. She looks up at him, showing the greyscale that has consumed the left side of her face.
STANNIS: You've grown since I last saw you.
She pulls him to sit on the bed.
SHIREEN: Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?
STANNIS: No.
SHIREEN: Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
STANNIS: He did. He fought bravely.
SHIREEN: He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
STANNIS: He won't be visiting, child.
SHIREEN: Why not? He's my friend. Look.
SHIREEN gets up and opens a nearby drawer. She returns with a carved two-masted boat.
SHIREEN: He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
STANNIS: Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.
SHIREEN looks down, cradling her ship. STANNIS rises and exits.
INT: Harenhall bathing chamber
BRIENE sits in a large bath pool in an ornate bathing room, scrubbing the layers of filth from her arms with a bristle brush.
JAIME: Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
JAMIE has entered with a SQUIRE. BRIENNE is surprised.
BRIENNE: What are you doing here?
JAIME: I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
The SQUIRE helps JAIME undress. We see JAIME's stubbed wrist, wrapped cleanly and tightly.
JAIME: Now get out.
The SQUIRE exits. JAIME removes his trousers and BRIENNE looks away in modesty. JAIME moves to  enter the tub with Brienne
BRIENNE: There's another tub.
BREINNE moves to the far corner of the tub, but JAIME walks to join her. He steps in
JAIME: This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.
BRIENNE: Why should I care how you die?
JAIME: You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.
BRIENNE stands bold and naked, challenging JAIME to continue. He is shamed.
JAIME: That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most--
BRIENNE: Don't you mock me.
JAIME: I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
BRIENNE: You need trust to have a truce.
JAIME: I trust you.
BRIENNE sits, appeased, but fuming.
JAIME: There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for 17 years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
BRIENNE: Of course.
BRIENNE stares wide-eyed, and doesn't answer.
BRIENNE: If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
JAIME is exhausted after his speech. He breaths heavily
JAIME: Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
JAIME tries to stand, but collapses into BRIENNE's arms.
BRIENNE: Help! Help! The Kingslayer!
JAIME: Jaime. My name is Jaime.
INT: Dragonstone dungeon
SHIREEN whispers to a sleeping DAVOS through the iron bars of his cell.
SHIREEN: Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.
DAVOS: Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?
SHIREEN: Shh, you'll wake Bert.
DAVOS: Bert?
DAVOS comes to the bars to talk.
SHIREEN: He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
DAVOS: Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew--
SHIREEN: he said you Were a traitor. Are you?
DAVOS: I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price.
SHIREEN: I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
DAVOS: Aye. So they did.
SHIREEN: You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
DAVOS: Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me.
SHIREEN: Take it. I have more.
DAVOS: My lady, I can't read the words.
SHIREEN: You can't?
DAVIS: (shakes his head no)
SHIREEN: I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
DAVOS: No. No. No.
SHIREEN: It's easy. It'll be fun.
DAVOS: Go. We can't.
SHIREEN: Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?
DAVOS: (laughs) I wouldn't know where to start.
SHIREEN: At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'
EXT: Slaver's Bay
Unsullied and Dothraki march across the landscape. DAENERYS rides up on a white horse. JORAH and BARRISTAN talk on their mounts nearby.
JORAH: It was a bitch of a siege.
BARRISTAN: Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?
JORAH: The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his.
BARRISTAN: Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?
JORAH: Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.
BARRISTAN: (laughs)
JORAH: In full plate metal for 16 hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
JORAH and BARRISTAN lead their horses to water.
BARRISTAN: Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.
JORAH: You swore an oath.
BARRISTAN: Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?
BARRISTAN nods towards DAENERYS in the background.
JORAH: With all my heart.
CUT  TO: just ahead at the river.
DAENERYS: These are the ones?
MISSANDEI: Yes, khaleesi. The officers.
A score of Unsullied march and halt in front of them.
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
The Unsullied part, revealing their chosen leader, GREY WORM
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian)  Remove your helmet
GREY WORM removes his helmet and walks forward, head bowed. He then looks up at DAENERYS.
GREY WORM: (speaks Valyrian) This one has the honor
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) What is your name?
GREY WORM: (speaks Valyrian) Grey Worm.
Daenerys is confused.
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Grey Worm.
DAENERYS: (speaks Valeryan) From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride.
GREY WORM: (speaks Valeryan) "Grey Worm" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.
CUT TO: Further back on the river.
JORAH and BARRISTAN lead their horses.
JORAH: King Robert wanted her dead.
BARRISTAN: Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
JORAH: I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
BARRISTAN: I didn't sit on the small council.
JORAH: No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally--
BARRISTAN: Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion.
The mount their horses.
BARRISTAN: He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
They begin to ride alongside the marching Dothraki and Unsullied.
BARRISTAN: Mm-hmm.
JORAH: Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
BARRISTAN: She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience.
JORAH: Which men do you have in mind?
BARRISTAN: Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.
JORAH: It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
BARRISTAN: I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
JORAH: Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man.
BARRISTAN: We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
JORAH: You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
BARRISTAN: If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride.
JORAH: You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.
INT: Riverrun war room
ROBB surveys a battle map, in deep concentration.
TALISA: Come to bed.
ROBB: You were right.
ROBB throws down an army piece in disgust.
ROBB: The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
TALISA: Don't let him.
ROBB: What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
TALISA: We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
ROBB: Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children.
TALISA: Give them a new purpose.
ROBB: What?
TALISA: Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is.
ROBB takes her hand and uses it to point out locations on the large map.
ROBB: Here. And we're here. King's Landing--
He pauses as a thought takes his mind.
TALISA: What is it?
ROBB: I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not.
ROBB moves one piece to take another on the map.
ROBB: And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
TALISA: Can you do it?
ROBB moves a final piece with a clack.
EXT: King's Landing garden
SANSA and MARGAERY sit with a sumptuous meal, watching LORAS and another man battle for show.
SANSA: He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might
MARGAERY:  I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.
SANSA: Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
MARGAERY: And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.
LORAS: Squire!
OLYVAR rushes forward to give LORAS a goblet.
OLYVAR: Well fought, ser.
LORAS: That was no fight. I don't know you.
OLYVAR: Olyver, if it please you.
OLYVAR starts to undo the straps of LORAS' practice armor.
OLYVAR: I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.
LORAS: (chuckles)
Their eyes meet.
CUT TO: LORAS's chambers
LORAS and OLYVAR lie a bed in passionate and hungry embrace. OLYVAR Is nude.
LORAS: How did you know?
OLYVAR: Know what?
LORAS: That I wanted to.
OLYVAR stands to get a drink.
LORAS: My lord I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.
OLYVAR: They rarely do, in my experience.
LORAS approaches behind him.
LORAS: You have a good deal of experience, do you?
OLYVAR: With the husbands.
They embrace and return to bed.
INT: Littlefinger's Chambers
LITTLEFINGER: That didn't take long.
OLYVAR: Well, it took long enough. It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.
LITTLEFINGER: Is he? And who's the lucky girl?
EXT: King's Landing shoreline overlook.
SANSA look out at a sailing ship in the bay.
LITTLEFINGER: She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?
SANSA: What is?
LITTLEFINGER: It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different.
SANSA: Is it?
LITTLEFINGER: Lady Margaery wears it that way.
SANSA: Many ladies wear it this way.
LITTLEFINGER: I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
SANSA: You still want me to come with you?
LITTLEFINGER: It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?
SANSA: Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.
LITTLEFINGER: I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend.
SANSA: I do, Lord Baelish.
LITTLEFINGER: Petyr.
SANSA: Petyr.
LITTLEFINGER: If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.
LITTLEFINGER kisses her hand.
LITTLEFINGER: We'll speak again when I return.
LITTLEFINGER exits.
INT: Tywin's chambers
TYRION enters, carrying a large tome. He spies CERSEI and pauses.
TYWIN: You're late.
TYRION: What's she doing here?
TYWIN: Our business concerns her, too. Sit.
TYRION sits at the table.
TYRION: You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.
TYWIN: Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
TYRION: I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
TYRION: (to Cersei) Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
TYWIN: Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
TYRION: Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.
TYWIN: Your jokes are not appreciated.
TYRION: It wasn't my best, but--
TYWIN: I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.
TYRION: Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
TYWIN: The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
TYRION: The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
TYWIN: There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
TYRION: And how do we do that?
TYWIN: We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
TYRION: Wonderful.
CERSEI: (amused) Yes, it is.
TYRION realizes TYWIN's intent to marry him to SANSA.
TYRION: You can't mean it.
TYWIN: I can and I do.
TYRION: Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
TYRION: She's a child!
CERSEI: She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.
TYWIN: There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that.
TYRION: And if I refuse?
TYWIN: You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
TYRION: I was wed. Or don't you remember?
TYWIN: Only too well.
CERSEI: You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
TYWIN: Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
CERSEI: What do you mean?
TYWIN: You'll marry Ser Loras.
CERSEI: I will not.
TYWIN: The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.
CERSEI: No, I won't do it.
TYWIN: Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.
CERSEI: I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.
TYWIN: You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
CERSEI: Father, don't make me do it again, please.
TYWIN slams his fist on the table and rises.
TYWIN: Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
TYWIN exits. Both CERSEI and TYRION brood.

SAM tends to the fire while GILLY sits nearby, cradling her baby.
GILLY: You've got too much wood in there.
SAM: But the more wood, the bigger the fire.
GILLY: It needs to breathe. Take off that big log.
SAM removes the log. The fire quickly comes to life.
SAM: Huh. You know your fires.
SAM sits.
GILLY: Someone built your fires for you growing up?
SAM: It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course.
GILLY: I knew you were highborn.
SAM: Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think.
SAM pulls out the dragonglass knife.
GILLY: What does it do?
SAM: I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?
GILLY: How much longer?
SAM: Not so far. A few more days.
GILLY: Is the Wall as big as they say?
SAM: Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
GILLY: You're playing with me.
SAM: I'm not. It's 700 feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best.
GILLY: Do you sing?
SAM: No. No, no, no. Not very well.
GILLY: Sing me a song.
SAM: Oh, all right. Let's see.
The baby fusses.
SAM: Oh ahem. (sings) The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife  /And she loves her little children.
EXT: The North, morning
MEERA skins a rabbit while OSHA looks on.
OSHA: That's not how you skin a rabbit.
MEERA: I know how to skin a rabbit.
OSHA: Not by the looks of it.
BRAN sits, back to a tree nearby. OSHA skins another rabbit in a quick motion and twists its head off.
OSHA: You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game.
MEERA: I didn't see any game before I got here.
OSHA: If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits.
MEERA: Well, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall.
OSHA: You learn how to use your fists, though.
MEERA: Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?
OSHA: I had someone else in mind.
MEERA: Well, someone else is sitting right here.
BRAN: You're both very good at skinning rabbits.
OSHA: Some of us are just a little better.
MEERA: Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?
OSHA: You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.
OSHA and MEERA stand, posturing for a fight.
BRAN: Stop it!
HODOR: Hodor.
BRAN: You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.
OSHA: Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.
BRAN: You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.
OSHA: Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.
BRAN: First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace.
OSHA and MEERA kneel and get back to work.
MEERA: Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.
OSHA: I said so, didn't I?
BRAN: Osha!
OSHA: You're a good little hunter.
MEERA: Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you.
OSHA: Don't push me.
JOJEN begins to spasm in his sleep. MEERA goes to him to help. She places a leather belt between his teeth. The spasm continues.
MEERA: Shh. I'm right here with you.
RICKON wakes.
RICKON: What's happening?
MEERA: I'm right here with you.
RICKON: What's wrong with him?
JOJEN's fit worsens, his eyes now open.
MEERA: The visions take their toll.
BRAN: He's having one now?
MEERA: (nods)
JOEN cones to his senses and sits up.
JOJEN: I saw Jon Snow.
BRAN: You saw him? At Castle Black?
JOJEN: He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.
EXT: North of the Wall
The Wildlings pack up their camp in the woods. TORMUND, ORELL, JON and YGRITTE are among them.
TORMUND: Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes.
TORMUND exits.
ORELL: Your flock gets smaller every year.
ORELL exits.
JON: You ever climbed it before?
YGRITTE: No. But Tormund's done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.
JON: Aren't you?
YGRITTE: Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down.
JON sits. YGRITTE hands him some climbing cleats to strap onto his boots.
YGRITTE: I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good.
JON: You kill someone for them?
YGRITTE: Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised.
They laugh.
YGRITTE: He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.
JON: Can we not talk about that here?
YGRITTE: 'Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.'
JON: Did I seem scared the other day?
YGRITTE: You were trembling like a leaf.
JON: Only in the beginning.
YGRITTE: Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
JON: What secret?
YGRITTE: Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
JON freezes. YGRITTE comes closer, furtively.
YGRITTE: But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down.
She moves to sit next to him.
YGRITTE: It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.
JON: I won't.
YGRITTE: 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
TORMUND returns. He hands JON a climbing axe.
TORMUND: Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers.
EXT: Riverlands Woods, the Brotherhood without Banners.
ARYA practices with a bow, shooting arrows into a straw man. She says a name with each arrow she lets fly. ANGUY watches, while THOROS sit nearby, drinking.
ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.
ANGUY: You're good. You're not as good as you think you are.
ANGUY: Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position.
ARYA pulls back the bow and ANGUY corrects her form.
ANGUY: Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold.
ARYA lowers the bow.
ARYA: What?
ANGUY: Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.
ARYA: But I have to aim.
ANGUY: Never aim.
ARYA: Never aim?
ANGUY: Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.
ARYA draws the bow.
ARYA: There's someone out there.
A party of mounted travelers approaches. ANGUY takes the bow and meets them on the path.
ANGUY: That's about far enough.
MELISANDRE lowers her red hood.
MELISANDRE: We come as friends.
ANGUY: Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that.
MELISANDRE: Valar morghulis.
THOROS: Valar dohaeris. (speaks Valyrian) I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.
MELISANDRE: (speaks Valyrian) You are Thoros of Myr.
THOROS: (nods)
MELISANDRE: (speaks Valyrian) The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?
THOROS: (speaks Valyrian) I failed.
MELISANDRE: (speaks Valyrian) You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk.
THOROS: (speaks Valyrian) You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?
THOROS: My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?
EXT: Brotherhood's caverns.
BERIC sits by the fire. MELISANDRE and THOROS enter. He stands.
BERIC: Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.
THOROS: Lucky for the ladies.
Melisandre scans Beric, with both her eyes and her hand. She is fascinated by his scars.
MELISANDRE: How many times has the Lord brought him back?
THOROS: Six.
MELISANDRE: (speaks Valerian) That's not possible.
THOROS: (speaks Valerian) The Lord has smiled upon me.
MELISANDRE: (speaks Valerian) You should not have this power.
THOROS: (speaks Valerian) I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will.
THOROS sits and begins to drink again.
THOROS: I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him.
MELISANDRE: You've been to the other side.
BERIC: The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason.
MELISANDRE: You have someone He needs.
CUT TO: The woods outside the cavern.
ANGUY hands an arrowhead to GENDRY.
ANGUY: Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at 200 yards. Can you make 'em?
GENDRY: Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel.
ANGUY: I'll get you the steel.
MAN: Come on.
MELISANDRE and her men pass nearby, pulling a wagon.
ARYA: I don't like that woman.
MELISANDRE, THOROS and BERIC approach.
ANGUY: That's 'cause you're a girl.
GENDRY: (laughs)
ARYA: What does that have to do with anything?
BERIC: Forgive me, lad.
Two of MELISANDRE's guards grab and bind Gendry.
ARYA: What are you doing? Let go of him.
ARYA tries to intervene, but the guard pushes her away easily.
ARYA: Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
BERIC: We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
ARYA: Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
A GUARD returns from the horses with two sacks of gold. He hands them to BERIC. MELISANDRE walks away.
ARYA: You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
THOROS: We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold.
GENDRY: You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
MELISANDRE: You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.
ARYA approaches MELISANDRE from behind, and spins her around from the elbow.
ARYA: You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
Melisandre grabs Arya's chin.
The wagon carrying GENDRY drives away.
EXT: The wall.
TORMUND, ORELL, YGRITTE, JON climb the wall. Three more wildlings lag behind. The wind howls and the snow swirls. They use ropes, pitons and axes. The climb is slow and arduous.  The height is  dizzying.
YGRITTE: You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?
JON smiles. Just above them, TORMUND's axe releases a cluster of ice from the wall.
TORMUND: Look out!
ORELL and YGRITTE dodge, but the falling ice hits JON in the face, and he loses his grip. His pitons gives way, and he slides helplessly down the wall until the slack of his rope is used up.
YGRITTE: You all right?
JON begins to climb again.
TORMUND: Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.
INT: A dungeon, somewhere.
RAMSAY blows a horn, waking THEON, who is bound to the X-shaped cross.
RAMSAY: Sorry. Were you sleeping?
THEON: Wa--
RAMSAY: Wa--? Wa--? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
RAMSAY holds up the mug from the table next to him. He slowly pours out the water to the floor. He rises and walks to THEON>
THEON: (whimpering)
RAMSAY: So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
THEON: Please.
RAMSAY: Please is not a body part.
THEON: I'll tell you everything, please.
RAMSAY: But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you.
Ramsay prods Theon.
RAMSAY: Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that.
RAMSAY works at the leather straps on THEON's right hand.
THEON: (groans)
RAMSAY: You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.
THEON: If I win, you'll let me go?
RAMSAY: If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.
THEON: Please.
RAMSAY draws a knife brandishes just before THEON's chin.
RAMSAY: You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
THEON: The North.
RAMSAY: Too vague.
THEON: Deepwood Motte.
RAMSAY: Terrible guess.
RAMSAY tortures THEON by stabbing his right pinky. THEON cries out.
RAMSAY: Now, where?
THEON: Last Hearth.
RAMSAY: Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
This time, RAMSAY holds the knife in THEON's pinky for much longer.
THEON: Karhold!
RAMSAY stops.
RAMSAY: Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
THEON: No. It was just a guess.
RAMSAY: Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?
THEON: Torrhen Karstark.
RAMSAY: He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
THEON: He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
RAMSAY walks away.
THEON: You swore to tell me if I--
RAMSAY: You're right.
THEON: Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.
RAMSAY: Yes. You win.
THEON is relieved. RAMSAY looks dejected. But get rises suddenly, full of energy.
RAMSAY: Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.
Ramsay tortures Theon by twisting his knife in the tip of THEON's pinky.
THEON: (screams louder than before)
RAMSAY: I'm afraid I am.
RAMSAY squeezes THEON's pinkie.
RAMSAY: Everything I told you is a lie.
RAMSAY continues to punish THEON's pinky.
THEON: (screams in desperation)
The torture continues.
THEON: Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!
RAMSAY stops and stands before THEON. He smiles.
RAMSAY: I win.
INT: Riverrun Great Hall
Robb, Catelyn, Brynden, Edmure, Black Walder and Lothar sit around a large table.
ROBB: Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
BLACK WALDER: The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come.
LOTHAR: Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
ROBB: Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.  Black WALDER: As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.
EDMURE: I don't think that's--
ROBB: We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
BLACK WALDER: And there's something else.
ROBB: We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
BLACK WALDER: Not what, whom.
BLACK WALDER looks at EDMURE.
EDMURE: What?
BRYDEN, ROBB and LOTHAR also stare at. EDMURE.
EDMURE: (chuckles) No.
EDMURE: How old is she?
LOTHAR: 19
EDMURE: Could I see her first?
BLACK WALDER: You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
BRYNDEN: Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
LOTHAR: Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.  Black WALDER: And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
ROBB: He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER exit.
EDMURE: Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord.
EDMURE stands.
ROBB: He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
EDMURE: I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
BRYNDEN stands and walks to EDMURE.
BRYNDEN: Listen to me and listen very carefully. You--
EDMURE: The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
BRYNDEN: The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
ROBB: It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.
BRYDEN sits.
EDMURE: He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing.
CATELYN: You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
ROBB: I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
BRYNDEN: You recall that heroic engagement?
EDMURE: I had something less permanent in mind.
ROBB: I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.
EDMURE: I'll marry her.
ROBB: You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it.
INT: Harenhall dining room
JAIME struggles to feed himself one-handed. BRIENNE sits next to him in a gown, and ROOSE sits across from them both.
ROOSE BOLTON: I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
BRIENNE: Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.  Roose BOLTON: When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason.
Brienne stabs Jaime's steak so that he has leverage to cut it.
ROOSE BOLTON: I should send you back to Robb Stark.
JAIME: You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?
ROOSE BOLTON: Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
JAIME: We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
ROOSE BOLTON: You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
JAIME: It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.
ROOSE BOLTON: King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
JAIME: He'll make time for you.
ROOSE BOLTON: As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.
JAIME nods and reaches for a pitcher.
JAIME: Shall we drink on it?
JAIME begins to pour, but ROOSE stops him.
ROOSE BOLTON: I don't partake.
JAIME: You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
JAIME pours wine for BRIENNE and himself.
JAIME: Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.
ROOSE BOLTON: Oh, she won't be going with you.
BRIENNE: I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to--
ROOSE BOLTON: You are charged with abetting treason.
JAIME: I'm afraid I must insist.
ROOSE BOLTON: You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
INT: King's Landing, Tywin's chambers.
OLENNA: Impossible.
TYWIN pours some wine.
TYWIN: Why?
OLENNA: My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter--
TYWIN: Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king.
TYWIN hands a glass to OLENNA.
OLENNA: Old.
TYWIN: Old?
OLENNA: Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.
TYWIN: The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?
OLENNA: Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through.
TYWIN: And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
OLENNA: Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?
TYWIN: Of course.
OLENNA: And you never--
TYWIN: No.
OLENNA: Not once? Not in any way?
TYWIN: Never.
OLENNA: I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.
TYWIN: Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
TYWIN: I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
TYWIN stands, offended. He pours himself more wine.
OLENNA: Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.
TYWIN: I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
OLENNA refuses TYWIN's offer for more wine.
OLENNA: As an authority on myself, I must disagree.
TYWIN: Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.
OLENNA: And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take.
TYWIN: The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
TYWIN sits back down at his desk.
TYWIN: If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children.
OLENNA: Oh
TYWIN: The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
OLENNA: You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
TYWIN: I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?
TYWIN takes up a quill and prepares to write. OLENNA stands, and takes the quill from his hand.
OLENNA snaps the quill.
EXT: The Wall.
The weather has worsened for the climbers. They shout to be heard over the howling winds. Each blow of the axe takes great strength to penetrate the ice. YGRITTE buries her axe in the wall, but a great crack opens across it. The ice wall cracks and pops to her right as the fissure travels across it. Suddenly, a huge swath of the wall gives way, taking three wildlings with it. They scream amidst the roar.
ORELL: No!
ORELL digs his axe deep into the wall. TORMUND does the same, bracing himself in a wide stance. The wall under YGRITTE and JON gives way and they falls amid an avalanche of ice and snow.
YGRITTE: (screams)
TORMUND prepares for the force of their fall on the rope that tethers them together.
TORMUND: (grunts)
YGRITTE: (screams)
JON: (screams)
ORELL loses his grip on the wall. He dangles, trying to gain purchase with his climbing axe. TORMUND holds on as best he can.
TORMUND: (grunts)
ORELL: We've gotta cut them loose!
TORMUND: No!
ORELL unsheathes his knife and begins to saw at the rope that connects him to YGRITTE and JON. They hang and dangle helplessly far from the wall, swinging back and forth. ORELL continues to cut through the rope. JON finally swings far enough to plant his axe in solid ice. At the same moment, ORELL cuts through the rope and YGRITTE plummets, limbs spinning. Her fall halts when the rope to JON goes taught.
JON: (grunts)
YGRITTE: (screams)
JON: (grunts)
YGRITTE: (screams)
Jon tries to quiet the rope beneath him. YGRITTE hacks her axe into the wall. She climbs up to JON. He reaches out his hand.
JON: Take my hand!
They strain to connect, then clasp hands. JON pulls YGRITTE up to safety. They embrace, panting and exhausted. JON looks up to the sneering ORELL. They all begin to climb again.
EXT: King's Landing garden.
SANSA and LORAS sit by a garden pool.
SANSA: That's a wonderful pin.
LORAS: Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so
SANSA:  I'm very happy about
LORAS: Uh, yes. I-I am as well.
SANSA: I feel like I'm in a dream.
LORAS: Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?
SANSA: No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
LORAS: It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is.
LORAS stands and  takes Sansa's hand to lead her away
CUT TO: Garden overlook.
TYRION and CERSEI watch SANSA and LORAS from afar.
TYRION: I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
CERSEI: We can have them both killed.
TYRION: It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
CERSEI: Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
They move inside and CERSEI sits.
TYRION: On a boat you built.
CERSEI: The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
TYRION: I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
CERSEI: I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.
TYRION: Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
Cersei doesn't answer.
TYRION: The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.
CERSEI: What do you want me to say?
TYRION: I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
CERSEI: Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
TYRION: Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
CERSEI: Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands.
TYRION: You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.
CERSEI: When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere.
TYRION: Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.
CERSEI: Who's going to tell her?
INT: Sansa's chambers.
SHAE helps SANSA with her dress.
SANSA: Do you think people will like it?
SHAE: I don't think they will even notice it.
SANSA: You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade.
SHAE: I'm sure he does.
SANSA: Will they let me invite my family?
SHAE: They haven't asked my opinion.
SANSA: But do you think they will?
SHAE: No.
The door opens.
MAID: Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I--
TYRION enters, catching SANSA partially dressed.
TYRION: I beg your pardon, my lady.
SHAE helps SANSA to recover her decency.
SANSA: Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.
TYRION: Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.
SANSA: Of course.
TYRION: Alone, if I may.
SHAE: Why do you need to speak to her alone?
SANSA: Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.
TYRION: Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
SANSA: It's all right, really.
TYRION closes the door.
INT: The Throne Room
VARYS and LITTLEFINGER look at the Iron Throne.
VARYS: 1000 blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.
LITTLEFINGER: There aren't There aren't even 200. I've counted.
VARYS: Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice.
LITTLEFINGER: Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.
VARYS: Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?
LITTLEFINGER: You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.
VARYS: I did what I did for the good of the realm.
LITTLEFINGER: The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
VARYS: But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
LITTLEFINGER: Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
CUT TO: Joffrey's chambers
Joffrey sits pensively with his crossbow. He stands and walks out, past the bloodied corpse of Ros. Her hands are tied above her head, and she is pierced by multiple crossbow bolts.
LITTLEFINGER: (voice over) Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
CUT TO: King's Landing Garden
Sansa and Shae watch a boat sail away from King's Landing. Sansa weeps hopelessly. Shae is sad, but resolute.
LITTLEFINGER: (voice over) And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.
EXT: The top of the Wall
YGRITTE pulls herself over the lip of the wall, exhausted. TORMUND and ORELL have already crested. TORMUND pulls up more supplies while ORELL looks through their provisions. YGRITTE doesn't have the strength to stand. JON pulls himself up as well, and collapses beside her. Above them, the sun breaks through the clouds. YGRITTE and JON prop themselves up and look across the northlands. It is beautiful. JON stands and helps YGRITTE up. The sun lights up the wall. JON leads YGRITTE to look at the southern side of the wall. The land is green and lush. They embrace and kiss.
EXT: The North
Just south of the wall, the wildlings march across the green expanse of the North.
YGRITTE: How far are we?
JON:  About a week, I think.
YGRITTE: You think? You don't know?
JON:  When we went to Castle Black, we took the kingsroad.
JON and YGRITTE sit. She adjusts her boots.
YGRITTE: You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting?  You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
JON:  Most of the time, yes.
YGRITTE: How do the men holding the banners fight?
JON:  They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.
JON:  Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
YGRITTE: So what good are they?
JON: They help the men march.
YGRITTE: How?
YGRITTE stands up and play-acts a silly march.
YGRITTE: Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.
JON: No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.
YGRITTE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.
YGRITTE leaves and ORELL catches up with JON.
ORELL: She's right, you don't.
JON: I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
ORELL: Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are.
JON: And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
ORELL:  People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her.
ORELL continues on. JON follows behind.
INT: Riverrun, ROBB's chambers at night
A thunderstorm roils outside of Riverrun. TALISA dries ROBB's hair with a towel. CATELYN and EDMURE sit at the map table. BRYNDEN enters.
BRYNDEN: That rain will cost us another day.
ROBB: Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
CATELYN: Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
BRYNDEN: Prickly?  That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
CATELYN: Yes, and that is why--
BRYNDEN: I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.
TALISA: I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits.
BRYNDEN: (laughs)
CATELYN: Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
EDMURE: He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.
CATELYN:  He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
ROBB: Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
BRYNDEN, CATELYN and EDMURE leave. ROBB and TALISA kiss. CATELYN turns back to watch before she exits.
CUT TO: ROBB and TALISA's room, later
TALISSA and ROBB are wrapped around one another, panting, glowing with sweat, and kissing intimately. They smile. ROBB stands and dons a robe. TALISA watches him, amorously.
ROBB: If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again.
TALISA: Attack. Attack.
ROBB sits at the war table. TALISA pulls a writing board onto the bed.
ROBB: Who are you writing?
TALISA:  My mother.
ROBB: Is that Valyrian?
TALISA: Gaaa.
ROBB: Gaaa? (sighs) Say hello for me.
TALISA: Rytsas.
ROBB: 'Ritsas.'
TALISA: That was close enough.
ROBB: Does she know her daughter's a queen?
TALISA:  Not yet.
ROBB: That will be a surprise, I expect.
TALISA: Many surprises for her.
ROBB: How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
TALISA:  Will you come with me one day to Volantis?  When all this is over?
ROBB:  I will.
TALISA: I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.
ROBB: What, now?  Are you certain?
ROBB stands.
TALISA:  Are you angry with me?
ROBB caresses her face. She grabs hold.
ROBB:  Angry? You're my queen.
TALISA: And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
ROBB: Maybe one of each.
TALISA: Don't get greedy.
TALISA kisses ROBB's hand.
TALISA: Can you leave the war for one night?
ROBB:  I love you. Do you hear me?  I love you.
Robb and Talisa kiss and fall into bed.
CUT TO: Riverrun encampment
Rain pours down as ROBB's men busy themselves with the chores of the night.
EXT: The North, day
The wildlings rest in the woods from their long march.
TORMUND: Most men fuck like dogs.
TORMUND demonstrates for JON with pelvic thrusts into his pack. YGRITTE sits nearby, disapproving.
TORMUND: No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. (laughts) Come on! Hey, come on.
Tormund gives Jon a playful jab and walks off. JON gets up and follows, along with YGRITTE and ORELL.
CUT TO: The woods, a bit later.
The wildings march.
ORELL: You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?
YGRITTE:  No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks.
ORELL: I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls.
YGRITTE: What, you're jealous?
ORELL:  Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
YGRITTE: And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
ORELL stops her.
ORELL: You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?
YGRITTE: (nods)
ORELL:  'Cause he's pretty?  Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
YGRITTE tries to walk, but ORELL stops her.
YGRITTE:  Don't touch me.
ORELL: You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.
ORELL walks away, and YGRITTE takes measure of him.
EXT: King's Landing garden
MARGAERY: Come on. Come walk with me.
Margaery and Sansa stand and walk
MARGAERY: I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother.
MARGAERY picks a rose.
MARGAERY: You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
SANSA: How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
MARGAERY hands the rose to SANSA.
MARGAERY: Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
SANSA: No.
They walk.
MARGAERY: Has he been kind to you?
SANSA:  He's tried.
MARGAERY: You don't want him, though.
SANSA: He's a Lannister.
MARGAERY: Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?
SANSA:  I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
MARGAERY: My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?
MARGAERY: If it's the pain you're worried about--
SANSA: I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
MARGAERY: What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar.
MARGAERY: Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.
SANSA: And that's a good thing?
MARGAERY:  It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice.
SANSA: How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
MARGAERY takes SANSA's arm.
MARGAERY:  Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.
INT: King's Landing, TYRION's chambers
TYRION and BRONN sit, drinking wine.
TYRION: She's a child.
BRONN: She's a foot taller than you.
TYRION: A tall child.
BRONN: What's the youngest you've ever had?
TYRION:  Not that young.
BRONN: How much older?
TYRION:  Older.
BRONN: You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem.
TYRION: Shae isn't going to like it.
BRONN: Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
TYRION:  I should never have told you about that.
BRONN: You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.
TYRION: Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
BRONN pours more wine for them both.
BRONN: You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. (chuckles) You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it.
TYRION: I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
BRONN: You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.
BRONN stands and grabs another pitcher of wine.
INT: King's Landing Throne Room
TYWIN enters the vast throne room. JOFFREY sits on the Iron Throne.
TYWIN: Your Grace.
JOFFREY: Grandfather.
TYWIN: You wanted to speak to me?
JOFFREY:  Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
TYWIN: You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them.
JOFFREY: I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
TYWIN: Of course.
JOFFREY: You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
TYWIN: I have, yes.
JOFFREY: May I ask why?
TYWIN:  The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively.
JOFFREY: So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?
TYWIN approaches and stands over JOFFREY.
TYWIN:  We could arrange to have you carried.
JOFFREY: Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
TYWIN: Where did you hear about this?
JOFFREY: Is it true?
TYWIN: Apparently so.
JOFFREY: Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
TYWIN:  When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple.
JOFFREY: And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
TYWIN: Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.
JOFFREY: But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
TYWIN:  Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
JOFFREY: But I haven't been counseled.
TYWIN: You are being counseled at this very moment.
JOFFREY: I should be consulted about such things.
TYWIN: From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace.
TYWIN bows and walks away. JOFFREY ponders.
EXT: Essos, outside Yunkai
DAENERYS, JORAH, BARRISTAN and GREY WORM walk across the rocky and arid landscape. An impressive cities lies in the distance among the mountains.
JORAH: Yunkai. The Yellow City.
BARRISTAN: The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them.
JORAH: On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man.
DAENERYS: I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
JORAH: We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.
DAENERYS: How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
JORAH:  200,000 if not more.
DAENERYS: Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city.
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor.  GREY WORM: (nods)
GREY WORM turns and exits.
CUT TO: The road to Yunkai.
The Unsullied come to attention. Led by a drummer and flanked by guards, a brightly colored palaquin carrying RADZAL MO ERAZ passes through. He surveys the Unsullied who speckle the rough landscape. The chains of the slaves who bear his load rattle as they walk. More slaves bear  ornate chests as they walk. They reach the camp where DAENERYS waits to receive them, with BARRISTAN, JORAH and her dragons at her side. The slaves lower the palaquin. RADZAL MO ERAZ steps out and is greeted by MISSANDEI.
MISSANDEI: Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace.
The dragons screech in warning as Razdal mo Eraz approaches nervously.
MISSANDEI: Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.
DAENERYS: You may approach. Sit.
A Dothraki woman presents a chair for RADZAL MO ERAZ, and he sits.
MISSANDEI: Will the noble lord take refreshment?
RADZAL MO ERAZ: (nods)
MISSANDEI pours him some wine. RADZAL MO ERAZ drinks, never taking his eyes from DAENERYS.
RADZAL MO ERAZ:  Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi.
DAENERYS tosses a raw steak in the air. The three dragons launch after it, screeching as they jockey and circle in flight.  RADZAL MO ERAZ recoils in trepidation.
DAENERYS: Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
RADZAL MO ERAZ: If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.
He claps twice to signal his slaves. They bring forth the two chests.
RADZAL MO ERAZ: The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
The slaves place the chests before DAENERYS and open their lids. The chests are filled with gold ingots. The slaves retreat and bow deeply before her in reverence.
RADZAL MO ERAZ: There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
DAENERYS: My ship?
RADZAL MO ERAZ: Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require.
DAENERYS: And what do you ask in return?
RADZAL MO ERAZ:  All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
DAENERYS: I have a gift for you as well. Your life.
RADZAL MO ERAZ: My life?
DAENERYS:  And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy.
RADZAL MO ERAZ: You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.
RADZAL MO ERAZ stands quickly. Drogon screeches angrily from his perch in warning.
RADZAL MO ERAZ: You swore me safe conduct.
DAENERYS: I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother.
RADZAL MO ERAZ: Take the gold.
The slaves rise and cautiously approach the open chests. The dragons refuse their approach with aggressive screeching. The slaves retreat in fear.
DAENERYS: My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out.
RADZAL MO ERAZ: (speaks Valerian)
RADZAL MO ERAZ turns and stomps off.
BARRISTAN: The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
DAENERYS: And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
JORAH:  I don't know.
DAENERYS: Find out.
JORAH nods and exits. Drogon hops next to DAENERYS and she strokes the dragon. He purrs.
INT: King's Landing, TYRION's chambers, night.
SHAE fondles a woven gold necklace in a beautiful inlaid wooden box.
SHAE: Chains?
TYRION:  Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.
SHAE: Golden chains.
TYRION: You could buy a ship with these.
SHAE: Do I need a ship?
TYRION: What?
SHAE: Am I going somewhere?
TYRION: Of course you're not going anywhere.
SHAE: So, am I invited to your wedding?
TYRION:  I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
SHAE: No?  She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.
TYRION: That doesn't mean that--this is duty, not desire.
SHAE: Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
TYRION:  I don't have a choice. My father--
SHAE: Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
TYRION: What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
SHAE: And I'm Shae the funny whore.
TYRION: My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
SHAE: While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?
TYRION:  I swear to you it will not be like that.
SHAE: No? What will it be like?
TYRION:  I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for.
SHAE: Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
TYRION moves closer to SHAE and takes her hand.
TYRION:  Listen. Listen to me, my lady.
SHAE: I'm not your lady.
TYRION: You are. You'll always be my lady.
SHAE: I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing.
SHAE pushes away TYRION's hand and exits.
EXT: Blackwater Bay, the seas by King's Landing
A two masted ship sails amongst wreckage of sunken ships. MELISANDRE and GENDRY walk its deck.
GENDRY: What happened?
MELISANDRE: Wildfire. I should have been here.
GENDRY: After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started.
MELISANDRE: Do you miss it?
GENDRY: King's Landing?
MELISANDRE: Your father's house.
GENDRY: Never had a father. Never wanted one.
MELISANDRE: Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?
GENDRY:  I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.
MELISANDRE: Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up.
GENDRY: I was born in Flea Bottom.
MELISANDRE: Your blood is noble.
GENDRY: Are you saying my father, he was some lord or
MELISANDRE: There. Your father's house.
GENDRY: I'm just a bastard.
MELISANDRE: The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood.
INT: Riverlands, The Brotherhood's Caverns
BERIC: Come sit by the fire, child.
ARYA doesn't answer. She sits curled on a rock.
THOROS: Not talking, eh? That's a first.
ARYA: I don't talk to traitors.
BERIC: I didn't like giving up the boy.
ARYA: But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.
BERIC: The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey.
ARYA: He's not my one true god.
BERIC: No? Who's yours?
ARYA:  Death.
Men chatter and cough as they enter the cavern, led by ANGUY.
ANGUY: Spotted a Lannister raiding party.
BERIC: How many?
ANGUY: No more than 20.
BERIC: How far?
ANGUY: Less than a day's ride south.
BERIC: (nods)
THOROS: What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?
MEN: Yeah!
ARYA: But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
THOROS: It will still be west of here two days from now.
ARYA: You swore.
BERIC: To take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first.
ARYA: Why? So you can steal their gold?
BERIC:  I swear to you, this isn't--
ARYA: I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all.
BERIC: One day you'll understand, but now--
ARYA runs off.
BERIC: Anguy, bring her back.
MAN: Come back, girl!
CUT TO: The woods outside the cavern, night.
Arya runs through the woods. She crosses a stream and keeps running. She crouches in the woods, looking back at the Brotherhood's torches. She takes flight again, and is grabbed by the HOUND.
HOUND: Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good.
He carries her off into the darkness.
INT: Harrenhall, night
BRIENNE sits in a shaft of moonlight. The door opens, and JAIME enters.
BRIENNE: I thought you were gone.
JAIME: Tomorrow.
BRIENNE: Have they told you what they plan to do with me?
JAIME:  Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.
BRIENNE: With Locke?
JAIME:  I owe you a debt.
BRIENNE: When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid.
JAIME: (nods) I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.
BRIENNE: Good-bye, Ser Jaime.
JAIME exits.
EXT: Harrenhall courtyard, day.
The courtyard is busy as the men ready to depart. JAIME struggles to saddle his horse one handed.
QYBURN: Here. Let me.
QYBURN  buckles the saddle for JAIME
QYBURN: It will take time.
JAIME: (nods)
QYBURN exits and ROOSE BOLTON approaches.  Roose BOLTON: Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain.
JAIME mounts his horse.
JAIME: My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.  Roose BOLTON: You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?
JAIME: (nods)  Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.
JAIME and QYBURN ride away. Theypasses LOCKE.
LOCKE: Safe journey, Kingslayer. Nothing to say? I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too. And don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her.
INT: Dungeon, somewhere
MYRANDA and VIOLET remove THEON's restraints and help him down from the cross.
MYRANDA: Shh.
THEON: (groans)
MYRANDA removes THEON's hood. VIOLET holds a cup of water to his lips, and helps him drink. He grabs the cup desperately and spills its contents in his mouth.
VIOLET: Gentle, my lord. Gentle.
VIOLET strokes and soothes THEON's forehead. MYRANDA kneels next to him and applies a salve to his forehead. THEON squirms.
THEON: (coughs)
VIOLET: Shh shh shh. Myranda knows what she's doing. Let her. She trained as a septa, only (giggles) she had other urges.
MYRANDA: So did the septons, only they lied about it.
VIOLET and MYRANDA fondle THEON's bare chest. THEON is suspicious.
THEON: Where is he?
VIOLET:  Who, my lord?
MYRANDA:  There's no one here but you, me, and Violet.
VIOLET and MYRANDA continue to caress THEON. VIOLET slides her hands under THEON's trousers. He grabs her hand to stop her.
THEON: Please.
VIOLET: Don't you want us to see it?
MYRANDA:  Oh, come on. Let us see it. Everybody talks about it.
THEON: He sent you.
MYRANDA: Who sent us?
VIOLET:  We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy.
MYRANDA: We heard so much about it. (giggles)
THEON: Please.
VIOLET: Oh! There it is.
She is disapointed that THEON is flaccid.
VIOLET: Oh. Do you think we're ugly?  He thinks we're ugly.
MYRANDA: Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face.
THEON: Help me. If he comes back
VIOLET: We need to make him feel better.
MYRANDA: And how can we make him feel better?
VIOLET:  I have an idea.
VIOLET stands and comes to MYRANDA. She pulls away the lacing of MYRANDA's dress until it peels away. She helps the dress to the ground. THEON is excited but disbelieving.
VIOLET: Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls.
MYRANDA: Maybe he doesn't know how we are.
MYRANDA straddles THEON and undulates on top of him. VIOLET kisses his forhead.
MYRANDA: Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy.
VIOLET: As good as they say?
MYRANDA: Mmm.
MYRANDA's breath quickens as she rubs across the length of him. THEON holds onto her, joining into her rhythm
VIOLET: And why should you get all the fun?
VIOLET shrugs off her own gown. THEON is entranced. MYRANDA grabs his face and pulls his attention back to her.
MYRANDA:  What? You like her better?
MYRANDA kisses THEON. VIOLET kneels beside them and grabs hold of THEON.
VIOLET:  Plenty there for both of us.
MYRANDA: I was here first.
THEON: (moaning)
RAMSAY's horn blares from across the room, startling THEON. VIOLET and MYRANDA retreat and RAMSAY walks out of the shadows.
RAMSAY: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing.
THEON: (cries)
RAMSAY: But I was getting jealous.
Ramsay stands in front of the naked VIOLET and MYRANDA, who sway innocently behind him.
RAMSAY: Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?
THEON leaps up in a clumsy attempt to flee. RAMSAY backhands him, and THEON falls to the ground, helpless and weak. RAMSAY tosses away the horn and wraps his arms around the naked women as they flank him.
RAMSAY:  Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.
RAMSAY cups their naked asses. He steps forward and draws a knife. THEON struggles to crawl away, but his arms and legs are useless from his days bound to the cross.
RAMSAY: Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?
RAMSAY whistles and two guards come forth.
THEON:  Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!
RAMSAY: This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.
The guards hold THEON down while RAMSAY sets to him with the knife.
THEON: No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!
EXT: The Northern woods.
YIGRITTE and JON crouch behind a rock. She has her bow at the ready, hunting a nearby deer.
JON: You're gonna scare it off.
YGRITTE: I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.
JON: It's too far away.
YGRITTE: (smiles)
YGRITTE draws her bow.
CUT TO: The  northern woods, later.
The wildling party is on the march. Two of them carry the deer that YGRITTE killed. In the near distance, YGRITTE spies a decrepit windmill.
YGRITTE: Is that a palace?
JON:  It's a windmill.
YGRITTE: Windmill. Who built it?  Some king?
JON:  Just the men who used to live here.
YGRITTE: They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high.
JON: Winterfell has towers three times that size.
YGRITTE: 'I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.'
JON: If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.
YGRITTE: What's swooning?
JON:  Fainting.
YGRITTE: What's fainting?
JON:  When a girl sees blood and collapses.
YGRITTE: Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
JON:  Well not all girls are like you.
YGRITTE: Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? (gasps) Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow.
She falls backwards into his arms, smiling.
YGRITTE: My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
JON: I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
She punches him playfully.
YGRITTE: Would you?
He grabs her.
JON:  So I could tear it off you.
YGRITTE: Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye.
JON: Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
YGRITTE: Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.
JON: Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that.
YGRITTE: You know nothing--
JON: Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed.
YGRITTE: And how do you know that?
JON:  Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same.
YGRITTE: Mance is different.
JON: You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
YGRITTE: You don't know that.
JON: I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you.
YGRITTE: All of us.
Ygritte kissed Jon, hungrily.
YGRITTE: You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live.
JON: Yes, first we'll live.
They kiss again.
EXT: The North, BRAN's camp.
MEERA walks into camp, carrying the rabbit she has caught. OSHA and HODOR sets up the tent while RICKON sleeps next to them. BRAN and JOJEN sit talking nearby.
OSHA: What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
HODOR:  Hodor.
JOJEN: That's where we are.
OSHA walks over to confront JOJEN.
OSHA: What are you telling him?
BRAN: It's all right, Osha.
OSHA: It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day?  Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.
MEERA: Leave him alone.
OSHA: He can speak for himself.
JOJEN: I don't fill his head with anything.
OSHA: So what do you talk about?
JOJEN:  What's happening to him and what that means.
OSHA: Go on, then. Tell us what it means.
JOJEN: It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.
OSHA: I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
OSHA starts to walk away.
JOJEN: We're not going to Castle Black.
OSHA: What did you say?
JOJEN:  I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
OSHA: Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me.
OSHA kneels next to BRAN.
BRAN: The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
OSHA: You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
BRAN: What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
OSHA:  Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.
BRAN: You don't understand. You don't know.
OSHA stands, agitated.
OSHA: You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long.
OSHA sits.
OSHA: I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.
OSHA rises and walks off.
EXT: Riverlands open field.
QYBURN tends to the stump of JAIME's right arm. His wrist is sewn roughly.
QYBURN: How is the pain, my lord?
JAIME:  What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
QYBURN:  Well, we've stymied the corruption.
JAIME: Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man.
QYBURN: All the good it's done me.
QYBURN places a salve onto JAIME's healing wound.
JAIME: You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
QYBURN: Faint praise, my lord.
JAIME: So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
QYBURN dresses JAIME's wound once more.
QYBURN:  No, my lord. That's not my weakness.
JAIME: What is?
QYBURN:  Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
JAIME: You performed experiments on living men.
QYBURN: On dying men.
JAIME: With their permission?
QYBURN:  My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
JAIME: Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.
QYBURN: How many men have you killed, my lord?
JAIME:  I don't know.
QYBURN: 50? 100?
JAIME: (shakes his head)
QYBURN: Countless.
JAIME: Countless has a nice ring to it.
QYBURN: And how many lives have you saved?
QYBURN:  A bird flew off and a bird flew back.  Lord Selwyn Tarth offered 300 gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
JAIME: A fair offer.
JAIME stands. QYBURN packs up his medicines.
QYBURN: A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
JAIME: Why not?
QYBURN:  He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
JAIME: (sighs)
QYBURN: He feels he's being cheated.
JAIME: They'd be fools to kill her.
QYBURN: These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much.
JAIME ponders, and then approaches STEELSHANKS WALTON, who drinks from a wine skin nearby
JAIME: We have to return to Harrenhal.
STEELSHANKS WALTON: Why?
JAIME:  I've left something behind.
STEELSHANKS WALTON: Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
JAIME: And what are those orders?
STEELSHANKS WALTON:  To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
JAIME: You think you'll get a reward.
STEELSHANKS WALTON stands.
STEELSHANKS WALTON: I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father--
JAIME: You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.
STEELSHANKS WALTON: I had nothing--
JAIME: Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
CUT TO: Horses galloping back to Harrenhall.
EXT: The ruins of Harrenhall.
JAIME and the en ride into the old courtyard. The castle is a ruin around them.
JAIME: Whoa.
STEELSHANKS WALTON: Eyes open, lads.
JAIME searches with eyes and ears.
JAIME: Be quiet.
JAIME hears singing in the distance. He dismounts and runs towards the sounds of the crowd. STEELSHANKS WALTON and his men follow.
MEN: (singing) The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered in hair He smelled that girl in the summer air The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!
Jaime climbs some wooden steps to join the crowd on a viewing platform. The crowd yells and cheers. In a wooden arena, Brienne stands desperate and defensive, brandishing a wooden sword. Her dress is torn and covered in  mud. Blood oozes from gashes on her neck and shoulder. An enormous brown bear lumbers and stalks her.  The bear roars.
MAN: Don't spare her.  Don't spare her!
LOCKE: Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight.
JAIME: A wooden sword?
LOCKE notices that JAIME is in the crowd.
LOCKE: I thought you'd gone.
JAIME pushes his way towards LOCKE.
JAIME: You gave her a wooden sword.
LOCKE: We've only got one bear.
JAIME: I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there.
LOCKE: All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
LOCKE shoves JAIME.
LOCKE: This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
The bear rears up before BRIENNE. She tries to hold him off with her wooden sword, but the bear's reach is too long. He takes a powerful swipe and disarms her. BRIENNE staggers backwards. The bear pounces and knocks her to the ground.
BRIENNE: Ah!
JAIME jumps into the wooden arena, arms flailing. He lands behind her, and startles the bear.
JAIME: Get behind me.
BRIENNE: I will not.
He helps BRIENNE up as the bear regroups. JAIME puts himself in front of BRIENNE. The bear regroups, swipes the ground and advances on them. Suddenly, a crossbow bolt pierces the bear's side. He turns his head towards the pain in its shoulder.
LOCKE: What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
STEELSHANKS WALTON:  Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
The bear shakes its head back and forth, confused by the pain. JAIME runs to the arena wall and crouches by the wall.
JAIME: Pull her up.
BRIENNE clambers onto JAIME's back. A man in the crowd grabs her outstretched hand. Two men pull her to safety. The bear roars.
BRIENNE: Hold my legs.
BRIENNE lies over the side of the platform and reaches down. The bear  charges at JAIME. STEELSHANKS WALTON fires a bolt that lands wide. JAIME jumps and grabs hold of a beam that juts out of the arena wall and clambers just out of reach of the bear. The bear roars. BRIENNE continues to reach down to JAIME as he tries clumsily to scale the wall. He swings his legs up, gains some leverage and hooks his handless forearm around the beam. He then lurches into BRIENNE's reach.
BRIENNE: Pull him up!
BRIENNE and the men pull JAIME up to safety. The bear pounds the wall.
LOCKE: The bitch stays.
JAIME stands up to confront LOCKE.
JAIME: We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
LOCKE: She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
JAIME: What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?  Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
JAIME and LOCKE stand off. LOCKE's men prepare for a fight, but LOCKE relents.
JAIME:  Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires.
JAIME and BRIENNE push their way through the crowd and walk off. STEELSHANKS WALTON follows. The bear roars.
EXT: Riverlands woods, morning
ARYA lies on the ground, eyes open. She gets up quietly, picks up a large rock and creeps towards the sleeping HOUND, step by step. The Hound sleeps peacefully. She raises it over her head to strike. Without moving, he speaks. She freezes.
HOUND: I'll give you one try, girl.
He turns to look at her.
HOUND: Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard.
CUT TO: Riverlands, edge of the woods, later.
The HOUND rides his horse, with ARYA sitting side saddle in front of him. He takes a bite of an apple and then offers to share with ARYA. She looks, but ignores it, so the HOUND takes another bite.
HOUND: Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you.
ARYA: There's no one worse than you.
HOUND: Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them.
ARYA: You're lying.
HOUND: Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open.
They reach a vista with an expansive river.
ARYA: Is that the Blackwater?
HOUND:  The Blackwater?  Where do you think I'm taking you?
ARYA:  Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
HOUND: Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
ARYA: But why?
HOUND:  Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
ARYA: Why would they be at the Twins?
HOUND:  Those outlaws you love so much never told you?  The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
The HOUND goads his mount, and they continue to ride.
EXT: Essos.
Soldiers gallop through the barren landscape outside Yunkai. DAENERYS, JORAH and BARRSITAN watch them from a distance, hidden in a crag. They are wrapped in drab fabrics to manage the heat of the desert.
BARRISTAN: Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
JORAH: They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
DAENERYS: You know these men?
JORAH:  Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, "The Titan's Bastard."
DAENERYS: Is he more titan or bastard?
JORAH:  He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are.
DAENERYS: How many?
BARRISTAN:  2,000, Your Grace. Armored and mounted.
DAENERYS: Enough to make a difference?
BARRISTAN: (nods)
DAENERYS:  It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
JORAH: I imagine you're right.
DAENERYS: I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
JORAH: He may not agree to meet.
DAENERYS: He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
CUT: Dany, Barristan, Mero, Prendahl, Daario, Jorah,Missandei
EXT: An open tent outside of Yunkai
BARRISTAN stands next to MERO, PRENDAHL and DAARO. DAENERYS sits in front of them with MISSANDEI and GREY WORM stand nearby.
DAARIO:  Daario Naharis
MERO steps forward.
MERO: You are the Mother of Dragons?  I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
JORAH: Mind your tongue.
MERO sits on the couch next to DAENERYS. DAARIO and PRENDAHL sit nearby.
MERO: Why?  I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
MERO waggles his tongue suggestively at DAENERYS. She does not react.
MERO: (laughs) You, slave girl, bring wine.
DAENERYS: We have no slaves here.
MERO: You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
DAENERYS: Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?
BARRISTAN: Under 2,000, Your Grace.
DAENERYS: We have more, don't we?
BARRISTAN:  10,000 Unsullied.
MISSANDEI serves wine to MERO, He toasts DAENERYS and drinks. MISSANDEI serves DAARIO and PRENDAHL.
DAENERYS: I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.
DAARIO: I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have 8,000 Unsullied.
DAENERYS: You're very young to be a captain.
PRENDAHL: He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
DAENERYS: Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side.
MERO: The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
JORAH: The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
DAENERYS: Or you could fight for me.
MERO motions for more wine. MISSANDEI obliges.
MERO: We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
DAENERYS: I would pay you as much and more.
MERO sniffs MISSNDEI, who jumps back, startled.
PRENDAHL: Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again.
DAENERYS: Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
DAARIO: You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
DAENERYS: A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide.
MERO: Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.  Grey WORM: (speaks Valyrian) My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?
DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) These men are our guests. (Speaks common.) You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
MERO: Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
DAENERYS:  A barrel, then.
MERO stands. DAARIO and PRENDAHL follow suit. They start to leave.
MERO: Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you.
DAARIO and DAENERYS exchange a glance. MERO gives a lecherous look to MISSANDEI as he passes.
MERO: I'll come looking for you when this is over.
Mero slaps Missandei's rump as he leaves.
DAENERYS: Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first.
BARRISTAN: Gladly, Your Grace.
EXT: Dragonstone shoreline.
Soldiers help MELISANDRE and GENDRY to exit their ship's boat. GENDRY looks up at the castle. MELISANDRE turns and GENDRY follows.
INT: Dragonstone War Room.
STANIS stands among his maps. MELISANDRE, GENDRY and their accompanying soldiers enter. STANNIS walks over to GENDRY and grabs him by the chin to get. a better look at his face. GENDRY stares back.
STANNIS: Half Robert, half lowborn.
MELISANDRE: Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
GENDRY exits with the soldiers.
STANNIS: What do you mean to do with him?
MELISANDRE:  You know what I mean to do with him.
STANNIS: Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?  If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy.
MELISANDRE: Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?
STANNIS:  No.
MELISANDRE: If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.
STANNIS: You've slaughtered many lambs?
MELISANDRE:  And none have seen the blade.
MELISSANDRE exits.
CUT TO: Dragonstone dungeon.
DAVOS sits, trying to sound out words by candlelight.
DAVOS smiles, pleased with himself. STANNIS enters and DAVOS rises to meet him. They talk across the bars that imprison DAVOS.
DAVOS: ' Your Grace.
STANNIS: They feeding you enough?
DAVOS:  Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain.
STANNIS: You don't belong in a place like this.
DAVOS: Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.
STANNIS: Yeah.
DAVOS: I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
DAVOS: (nods)
STANNIS: Melisandre's returned.
DAVOS: I didn't know she'd been gone.
STANNIS: Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
DAVOS: Why?
STANNIS:  She says there's power in king's blood.
DAVOS: She's going to kill him.
STANNIS: Sacrifice him.
DAVOS: Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice?  The boy is your nephew.
STANNIS: What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
DAVOS:  Because he has your blood in his veins.
STANNIS: So did Renly.
DAVOS: Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent.
STANNIS: How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no?  Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?
DAVOS:  Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?
STANNIS:  I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
DAVOS: I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
STANNIS: You have little regard for your own life.
DAVOS: Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.
STANNIS: I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?
EXT: Outside Yunkai
The camp of the Second Sons bustles with the work of the day. MERO, DAARIO and PRENDAHL sit in an open tent. MERO fondles the bare-chested WHORE who sits on his lap.
PRENDAHL:  Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
DAARIO: You talk too much.
MERO: She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
DAARIO: 8000 unsullied stand between her and your cock.
MERO: My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
DAARIO: She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
MERO: Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores.
DAARIO: I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend.
MERO: She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
DAARIO:  I fight for beauty.
PRENDAHL: For beauty?
MERO:  We fight for gold.
MERO: You'll die young.
PRENDAHL: What do we do about the dragon girl?  We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield.
MERO: There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
PRENDAHL: She's well guarded.
MERO: Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
PRENDAHL: Which one of us?
MERO:  Close your eyes, love.
The WHORE stands, and MERO picks up a coin purse. He pours out three coins into his hand.
MERO: Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking.
MERO hands the coins to the WHORE, spins her around and plants a kiss  and a slap on her ass.  She blindly feels her way forward to PRENDAHL, who takes a coin. She then fumbles back to MERO, and he takes a coin. She then orients he way to DAARIO.
DAARIO: Do you hear me?  Follow my voice. I'm right here.
She falls into his lap, laughing.
DAARIO: You have something for me?
DAARIO takes the final coin from the WHORE's hand, and holds it up. It is the Braavosi coin.
DAARIO:  Valar morghulis.
INT: King's Landing, Sansa's Chambers.
SHAE and two servants help SANSA with the final touches of her make-up. SHAE answers a kock at the door. She is displeased to see TYRION. The two servants leave, and SHAE ignores TYRION as he and PODRICK enter.
TYRION: Lady Sansa.
SANSA: You look very handsome, my lord.
TYRION: Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?
SHAE and PODRICK exit. TYRION shuts the door.
TYRION:  My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this.
SANSA: I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.
SANSA: I doubt that very much, my lord.
TYRION: You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
TYRION takes SANSA's hand, tenderly.
TYRION: But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?
SANSA:  When I have to.
TYRION: Well, today you have to.
SANSA smiles. TYRION leads her forward.
INT: King's Landing, the Sept of Baelor
CERSEI and MARGAERY look on as the sept is prepared for the wedding.
MARGAERY: You look radiant, Your Grace.
CERSEI: Radiant? Why radiant?
MARGAERY:  It's the word that came to mind.
MARGAERY takes CERSEI's arm in hers.
MARGAERY: We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
CERSEI: You're a musical girl, aren't you?  I imagine you have a lovely voice.
The begin to descend into the sept.
MARGAERY: A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.
CERSEI: Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?
They pass LORAS, and stop a bit further along.
MARGAERY:  Of course. They play it so often here at court.
CERSEI: So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
MARGAERY:  Not as well as you, I'm sure.
CERSEI: House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
MARGAERY: (nods)
CERSEI:  Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?
MARGAERY:  Gone.
CERSEI: Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.
They continue down the great stairs to the main floor.
CERSEI: I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'
They pause. CERSEI looks MARGAERY in the eye and frees her arm.
CERSEI: If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.
CERSEI exits.
CUT TO: Outside the sept.
The great doors open to Baelor's Sept. SANSA walks through them, alone.
CUT TO: Inside the sept.
TYRION stands on the stage, watching SANSA enter at the other side of the sept. The crowd quiets. SANSA pauses at the top of the steps. JOFFREY approaches, smirking.
SANSA: What are you doing?
JOFFREY:  Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband.
Sansa takes Joffrey's arm. The doors closes. They descend the stairs and walk throufgh the crowd, Sansa and Joffrey apprach Tyrion, passsing Bronn, Margaery, Olenna, Loras, Cersei, Tywin, Pycelle, and reach TYRION and the HIGH SEPTON. JOFFREY reaches down and takes TYRION's step stool, and noisily joins CERSEI and TYWIN. TYRION fumes.
HIGH SEPTON: You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
SANSA turns her back to TYRION. He attempts to cloak Sansa, but he is too short. Joffrey snickers and some in the crowd join in. TYWIN quiets their rudeness with a look.
TYRION: Could you-
SANSA kneels for TYRION. He places the cloak on her shoulders, and she accepts it. She rises
TYRION: Thank you.
HIGH SEPTON: Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever.
INT: DRAGONSTONE
GENDRY paces nervously in his chambers. The door opens noisily, and MELISANDRE enters, holding an ornate box.
MELISANDRE: Have you ever seen one like it?
GENDRY:  I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
MELISANDRE: It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth?  When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it.
MELISANDRE lights a stick and uses it to ignite some more candles.
GENDRY: In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
Melisandre hands a chalice of wine to Gendry.
MELISANDRE: Here, taste this.
GENDRY stands motionless, refusing the wine.
MELISANDRE: You think I'm trying to poison you?
MELISANDRE takes a deep drink. The GENDRY takes the wine from MELISANDRE, and drinks, thirstily.
GENDRY:  That's good.
He nearly finishes it in two drinks.
GENDRY: That's really good.
MELISANDRE: Where do you think it's from?
GENDRY:  I couldn't even guess.
MELISANDRE: Doesn't matter, does it?  It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take.
GENDRY: That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.
MELISANDRE strokes GENDRY's cheek.
MELISANDRE: There are no mistakes. Not for us.
GENDRY: I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
MELISANDRE takes a sip of wine. As she speaks, she caresses GENDRY and begins to undress him.
MELISANDRE: Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us.
MELISANDRE removes GENDRY's shirt.
MELISANDRE fondles GENDRY's midriff.
MELISANDRE: According to whom?  The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you?  Hmm?  When you pray to them, what's their answer?  A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see.
MELISANDRE drops her dress to the floor and caresses the back of GENDRY's head.
MELISANDRE: Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I.
MELISANDRE leads GENDRY to the side of the bed. She kisses him, and gently pushes him back onto the bed. She undoes his pants and strides him.
MELISANDRE: Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.
She helps him inside of her, and they both undulate and moan with pleasure. GENDRY fondles her breasts, and MELISANDRE gently leads his hands to the headboard of the grand bed. She quickly binds them with a single pull on a leather strap.
GENDRY: What are you doing?
MELISANDRE gives him a peck.
MELISANDRE:  You have to trust me.
She searches down GENDRY's body, and he gives himself over to her, eyes closed. She binds GENDRY's booted feet to the other end of the bed. He opens his eyes, watching and panting. MELISANDRE opens the ornate box at the side of the bed and pulls out a leech and places it on GENDRY's chest. He begins to panic.
GENDRY: What--?  Get it away. Get it off me.
MELISANDRE places more leeches on GENDRY's chest.
MELISANDRE: Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much.
GENDRY: Why are you doing this?
MELISANDRE:  I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
GENDRY: No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!
MELISANDRE places a leech on GENDRY's groin. The chamber door opens. STANNIS and DAVOS enter.
MELISANDRE:  You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
MELISANDRE walks to her dress and slips it back on. STANNIS  approaches them.
GENDRY: Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!
MELISANDRE returns to GENDRY, and removes the leeches with her forcepts.
GENDRY: (cries out)
Melisandre hands leeches to Stannis, next to the brazier that she lit earlier. Stannis takes out the leaches one by one, tossing them into the flames, which spark with each one.
STANNIS:  The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
INT: King's Landing, the wedding reception.
JOFFREY and CERSEI sit amist the festivities drinking wine and chatting. TYWIN sits to their left, stoic. At the head table, TYRION carefully (and drunkenly) fills his wine glass right to the brim. He smacks his lips and looks over to SANSA, who is disgusted with him. The Tyrells sit across the hall from the Lannisters. OLENNA speaks with amusement to LORAS and MARGAERY.
OLENNA: So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew?  Grandson?  I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute.
LORAS leaves in a huff. At the head table, TYRION checks his teeth in a golden plate and tosses it aside. TYWIN looks on with disdain as TYRION spills his wine. He starts to clean himself with the table cloth. The embarrasment brings SANSA out of her stiff discomfort.
TYRION: (snorts)
SANSA: Will you pardon me, my lord?
TYRION:  Of course. Of course. En--enjoy.
SANSA stands and exits. JOFFREY gets up to intercept her, but CERSEI steadies him with a touch to the hand.
CERSEI: Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
JOFFREY: I've got a lifetime for that.
JOFFREY shakes off her hand and leaves, CERSEI sighs and gets up to follow. Her handmaiden starts to trail her.
CERSEI: Stay.
Back at the head table, TYRION notices SANSA talking to VARYS, with SHAE standing by them. TYWIN appears beside him, startling TYRION.
TYWIN: You seem rather drunk.
TYRION: Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
TYWIN:  This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.
TYRION: And?
TYWIN:  If you're going to give her one, you need to perform.
TYRION: What did you once call me?  A drunken little lust-filled beast.
TYWIN: More than once.
TYRION: There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.
TYWIN takes away TYRION's wine and slams it on the table. TYRION spits and fumes.
TYWIN: You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty.
TYWIN returns to his own seat. LORAS stands above in the balustrade, surveying the scene from afar. TYRION salutes LORAS with his cup. LORAS looks away uncomfortably, and notices CERSEI on the balustrade, looking out at the sea. He approaches her.
LORAS: Well, my father once told me--
CERSEI: Nobody cares what your father once told you.
CERSEI exits.
CUT TO: The Wedding Celebration
SANSA walks through the revelry with SHAE. After opening a curtain for SANSA, SHAE quickly departs as JOFFREY intercepts SANSA.
JOFFREY: Congratulations, my lady.
SANSA: Thank you, Your Grace.
JOFFREY: Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?  What a glorious day.
SANSA: Yes, Your Grace.
JOFFREY: I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
SANSA does not reply.
JOFFREY: You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
JOFFREY smirks cruelly as he turns back to the main hall and claps his hands for attention.
JOFFREY: Time for the bedding ceremony.
TYRION: There will be no bedding ceremony.
JOFFREY takes SANSA's hand and leads her to the central banquet floor.
JOFFREY: Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.
TYRION: There will be no bedding ceremony.
JOFFREY: There will be if I command it.
TYRION stabs his knife resoundingly into the table in front of him. JOFFREY is shocked.
TYRION: Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
Tywin rises from his seat.
JOFFREY: What did you say? What did you say?
TYWIN:  I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.
TYRION's hand shakes with rage as he grips the knife with all his strength. Suddenly, he regains his drunken composure. He releases the knife and laughs obsequiously.
TYRION: A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there.
TYWIN: Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.
TYRION staggers from the head table, and tumbles into another as he walks.
TYRION: My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife.
TYRION entreats SANSA to come with him. She follows, embarrassed and small.
TYRION: I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree?  Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood.
CUT TO: Tyrion's Chambers
TYRION opens the door for SANSA. She enters nervously. TYRION closes the door, and staggers directly to the wine, and pours himself a glass.
SANSA: Is that wise, my lord?
TYRION:  Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion.
SANSA: Is that wise, Tyrion?
TYRION:  Nothing was ever wiser.
TYRION sits on the side of the bed.
TYRION: Astoundingly long.
SANSA: What?
TYRION:  Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
SANSA: 14
TYRION:  Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.
SANSA takes a breath. She pours herself some wine and drinks it. TYRION offers a drunken toast of solidarity. SANSA moves quietly and obediently to the bed and undresses her many layers while TYRION watches.
TYRION: Stop. I can't. I could, I won't.
SANSA: But your father--
TYRION: If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to.
SANSA: What if I never want you to?
TYRION toasts SANSA.
TYRION:  And so my watch begins.
TYRION drinks. He turns, sets down his glass, and passes out directly.  SANSA is speechless.
EXT: Encampment outside of Yunkai, night.
The encampment bustles in spite of the late hour, with the Unsullied patrolling the paths between the tents. One Unsullied trots through camp alone.
INT: Daenerys's tent
MISSANDEI bathes DAENERYS in a tub by candlelight
DAENERYS: 19
MISSANDEI: Yes, Your Grace.
DAENERYS: How can anyone speak 19 languages?
MISSANDEI:  It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
MISSANDEI:  Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
DAENERYS: (in Dothraki) Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
MISSANDEI: Athjahakar.
DAENERYS: Athjahaka.
MISSANDEI: Ath-ja-hakar.
DAENERYS: Athjahakar.
MISSANDEI: (nods)
DAENERYS: Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.
MISSANDEI: Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry.
MISSANDEI: (gasps)
DAENERYS turns to see MISSANDEI held captive, her mouth covered and a knife at her throat. Her assailant, DAARIO, wears the uniform of the Unsullied.
DAARIO: No screaming or she dies.
DAARIO leads MISSANDEI further into the tent. DAENERYS watches nervously, feeling vulnerable in her bath. DAARIO removes the knife from her throat, and lifts of the Unsullied helmet. His eyes smile at DAENERYS. She is confused and angry.
DAENERYS: What do you want?
DAARIO places the tip of his blade back onto MISSANDEI's throat.
DAARIO:  You.
DAENERYS: Let her go.
DAARIO: Don't scream, lovely girl.
DAARIO releases MISSANDEI with a grand gesture. She scampers next to DAENERYS.
DAENERYS: You were sent here to kill me?
DAARIO: (nods and chuckles)
DAENERYS:  So why haven't you?
DAARIO:  I don't want to.
DAENERYS: What do your captains have to say about that?
DAARIO:  You should ask them.
DAARIO removes his satchel and dumps its contents on the floor. The heads of MERO and PRENDAHL thud as they hit the floor.
DAENERYS: Why?
DAARIO:  We had philosophical differences.
DAENERYS: Over what?
DAARIO:  Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
DAENERYS: You're a strange man.
DAARIO: I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
DAENERYS: And this is supposed to impress me?
DAARIO:  Yes.
DAENERYS: Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
DAARIO:  They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
DAENERYS rises from her bath and steps to the floor. She stands naked before DAARIO, matching his confidence with her resolve. MISSANDEI steps behind her and slips her into a robe.
DAENERYS: Will you fight for me?
DAARIO: (nods)
DAENERYS walks to him.
DAENERYS:  Swear to me.
DAARIO unsheathes his sword and kneels, placing it across his knees.
DAARIO: The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours.
DAARIO bows his head.
INT: King's Landing, Tyrion's Chambers, morning.
The door to TYRION's chamber opens. SANSA sleeps alone in TYRION's bed. TYRION lies on the settee that he passed out on the night before.  SHAE walks in without looking at TYRION and slam the breakfast tray the she holds onto the table. SANSA rises from the bed while TYRION struggles to even prop himself up.
TYRION: You really ought to knock.
SHAE: I brought your breakfast.
Irritated, SHAE moves quickly through the room. She snatches SANSA's dress from under TYRION's head. His head thumps into the chair's arm. SHAE helps SANSA to dress while TYRION struggles with his hang over. SHAE begins to strip the bed, and notices that the sheets are stain-free. She softens and exchanges a sympathetic and understanding look with TYRION. She exits with the sheets.
EXT: North of the Wall, dusk.
SAM, GILLY and her BABY walk across the snowy landscape, exhausted. The wind churns. GILLY stops by a tree while SAM examines a broken farmhouse. A crow lands in the godswood tree above them
BABY: (fusses)
SAM: It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
BABY: (fusses)
GILLY hands the BABY to SAM. SAM smiles at the child while  GILLY collects firewood. A second crow joins the first in the tree. SAM pauses, surprised at the coincidence.
CUT TO: The broken barn, a bit later.
The wind howls and whistles in the night. Inside the broken barn, SAM tries to strike a fire with his flint stones.
SAM: How hard can it be to build a fire?
GILLY:  It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
SAM blinks rapidly, then sits next to GILLY. She spreads the furs over them both and looks at him.
BABY: (fusses)
SAM: He winked at me before.
GILLY: I doubt it.
SAM: I saw him wink at me.
GILLY: He blinked.
SAM: I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
GILLY: A what?
SAM:  Well, I mean, there's no real difference.
GILLY: A wink is on purpose.
SAM: You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
GILLY: Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
SAM:  What? No. This is just the way I talk.
GILLY: I'll build that fire.
GILLY sets down the BABY and stacks the wood. She tries to strike the flint.
SAM: Don't you think he should have a name?
GILLY:  I don't know many boys' names.
SAM: Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jon Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer.
GILLY: Craster.
SAM is taken aback. While he thinks of how to respond, the fire comes alive.
SAM: Uh, yes. Maybe that's not--
GILLY: Mormont.
GILLY feeds the fire.
SAM: That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name.
GILLY: Why is it a last name?
SAM:  Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly.
GILLY: His name is Samwell Tarly, too?
SAM:  No, Randyll Tarly.
GILLY: Randyll is a handsome name.
SAM: Please don't name him Randyll.
GILLY: Is your father cruel like mine?
SAM:  Different manner of cruel.
GILLY blows on the fire. Crows caw outside the broken barn.
GILLY: Not Randyll, then.
GILLY sits back down next to SAM. The sounds of crows escalate into a chorus of relentless cawing. SAM and GILLY listen with fear. SAM nods at her with a slight smile, and rises.
GILLY: Don't. Don't go out there.
SAM takes a burning torch from the fire.
SAM: I'll be back. I just want to look.
SAM reaches the side of the barn and looks out. He grabs his sword as he exits. The godswood tree is swarmed by crows. They cry out in a cacophany. GILLY joins SAM outside, clutching her BABY. Every branch of the godswood is covered by crows. There must be hundreds.
SAM: Go inside. Go back inside. I'll--
Suddenly the crows fall silent. A growl comes out of the darkness beyond them. SAM looks into the woods, and drops his torch.
GILLY: It's come for the baby.
A lone figure walks towards them from the woods. SAM readies his sword, two handed. The figure comes closer. It is a WHITE WALKER, approaching calmly.
SAM: Stay back!
The WHITE WALKER continues to approach. SAM extends his sword in front of him, an unconvincing threat. The WHITE WALKER is nearly upon SAM.
SAM:  You stay back!
The WHITE WALKER grabs SAM's sword. It sounds a resonant ring and suddenly shatters in his grip. He levels SAM with an uppercut that sends him sprawling to the ground. He turns his attention to GILLY and her BABY.
GILLY:  No, you can't have him! No!
SAM draws the dragonglass knife from his furs.
GILLY: No!
SAM runs to intercept the WHITE WALKER. He lunged and plants the dragonglass knife in the shoulder blade of the WHITE WALKER. The ghoul screeches and turns to attack SAM. But the WALKER seizes up, howls, and falls to his knees,  his flesh hardening and cracking like ice. Suddenly, he shatters into tiny shards, practically vanishing into crystal dust. SAM and GILLY are stupefied. The crows begin to sound again. SAM grabs GILLY. They run away from the barn and into the woods. The crows take to flight, swarming them and cawing in a thunderous clamor.
[Opening Credits]
[First scene shows the location of Casterly Rock (ancestral seat of House Lannister) on a giant map of Westeros. There are several game pieces representing different House sigils located on different parts of the map. ROBB STARK and CATELYN STARK are at a campsite, within a tent lit up by candles]
CATELYN: Are you sure about this?
ROBB: No.
CATELYN: It's dangerous.
[ROBB nods in agreement]
ROBB: If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible.  Take his home, take his gold, take his power.
CATELYN: Why are you telling me?
[ROBB pauses then walks around CATELYN]
ROBB: You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
[ROBB pours himself something to drink]
ROBB: Now Winterfell is burned to the ground.  The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.
[ROBB pauses]
ROBB: So, Casterly Rock?  I'm asking your advice.
[CATELYN pauses, staring at ROBB.  She then looks at the map]
CATELYN: We have enough men?
[ROBB grabs a House Frey piece]
ROBB: If Walder Frey cooperates.
CATELYN: If Walder Frey cooperates.
[Close up shots of the map showing the sigils of House Stark, House Frey and House Lannister]
CATELYN: If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.
[ROBB moves the House Frey piece to the House Stark side of the map]
ROBB: We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.
[A flash of anger spreads across CATELYN's face]
CATELYN: Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
The next scene shows ROBB'S direwolf, Grey Wind, as he leads House Stark's army to The Twins castle, the ancestral seat of House Frey.  [The scene shifts to the inside of The Twins, as a servant walks around with a plate of bread and salt in observation of the Westerosi tradition of "Guest Right".  ROBB, his wife TALISA MAEGYR, his uncle EDMURE TULLY, his great uncle BRYNDEN "BLACKFISH" TULLY, CATELYN and the Stark army are in the presence of WALDER FREY and his family.  ROBB takes a piece of bread, dips it into the salt and eats it while looking intently at WALDER]
WALDER: My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table.  I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven.
ROBB: We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.
[Servant stops in front of WALDER.  He takes a piece of bread from the plate and eats it]
ROBB: I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.
WALDER: Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace.  It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls.
[WALDER signals for his female relatives to appear before ROBB]
WALDER: One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are.
[As WALDER calls each relative by name, they briefly look up at ROBB]
WALDER: This is Arwyn, my daughter.  My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra.
[WALDER pauses to chew]
WALDER: My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
[EDMURE intently watches the Frey women]
WALDER: Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.  You could have had either.  Could have had both for all I care.
[EDMURE closes his eyes after hearing WALDER'S comments about his granddaughters]
WALDER: My granddaughter Marianne.  My granddaughter Freya.  My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?
[WALDER guessing at his granddaughter's name.  EDMURE raises his eyebrows]
MERRY: I'm Merry.
WALDER: Fine.  And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet.  Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.
[ROBB looks at the Frey women]
ROBB: My ladies.  All men should keep their word, kings most of all.  I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.  The fault is not with you.  Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.  I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another.  I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house.  I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.
[WALDER claps to signal the dismissal of the Frey women]
WALDER: Very good.
[WALDER focuses on TALISA]
WALDER: There she is.  Come closer, let me have a look at you.
[TALISA takes a couple of steps towards WALDER.  WALDER moves forward in his seat and squints]
WALDER: Still can't see you.  Old eyes.
[TALISA looks at ROBB who nods.  Frey men look on as she takes a couple more steps towards WALDER.  She bows her head]
WALDER: Love.  That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?  Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face.  Mmmm, very pretty.  Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.  Very shapely as well.  Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.  If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.
[WALDER leans forward with a grin]
WALDER: I can always see what's going on beneath a dress.  Been at this a long time.  I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is.  Doesn't drop an inch.
[WALDER grins, ROBB visibly uncomfortable]
WALDER: Your king says he betrayed me for love.  I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
[ROBB starts to step forward before CATELYN stops him]
WALDER: And I can respect that.  When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought.  Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.  We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men.
[ROBB visibly angry]
ROBB: Thank you, my lord.
[WALDER stands up and claps]
WALDER: Well, let's get ready.  The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Scene changes to the desert outside of the city of Yunkai on the continent of Essos.  An army of Unsullied are standing guard outside of DAENERYS TARGARYEN'S tent.  Inside her tent are her closest advisers: DAARIO NAHARIS, BARRISTAN SELMY, JORAH MORMONT and GREY WORM.  They are looking at a map of Yunkai]
DAENERYS: Where?
[DAARIO points at a location on the map]
DAARIO: There.
[DAARIO gets closer to DAENERYS, grabs and guides her hand to the location he was referring to.  JORAH watches him closely]
DAARIO: There, it's a back gate.  My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.
JORAH: Your men but not you?
DAARIO: I have no interest in slaves.  A man cannot make love to property.
[DAENERYS briefly looks up at DAARIO and JORAH briefly looks at her]
DAARIO: This is where we enter the city.  Very few guards, they know me.  They let me inside.
BARRISTAN: We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
DAARIO: I kill the guards.  I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.
[DAARIO nods at JORAH and GREY WORM.  JORAH looks at GREY WORM who briefly looks back]
DAARIO: Then comes the army.  Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.
JORAH: Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.  The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners.
DAARIO: You have a very suspicious mind.  In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.
[JORAH sighs and looks at Grey Worm]
JORAH: You command the Unsullied.  What do you think?
DAENERYS: [Speaking to Grey Worm in Valyrian] Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa.
GREY WORM: [In Valyrian] I trust him.
DAENERYS: [Speaking in the Common Tongue (in this case, English) again] You leave tonight.
JORAH: Very good.  We'll prepare.
[DAENERYS' advisers start to leave.  DAARIO grins at DAENERYS who looks back at him.  BARRISTAN walks towards JORAH]
BARRISTAN: Ser Jorah.  You can use an extra sword.
JORAH: You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.  Your place is by the Queen.  If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done.  No matter the cost, no matter our pride.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Scene shifts to Beyond The Wall in the North.  SAMWELL TARLY, GILLY and her baby are walking south towards Castle Black]
SAMWELL: We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us.  It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.  Too big, impossible to maintain.  Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.  It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.  No one's used it for centuries, most likely.  It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do.
[GILLY stops and looks at SAMWELL in a confused manner]
GILLY: How do you know all that?
SAMWELL: I read about it in a very old book.
GILLY: You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
SAMWELL: Yes.
GILLY: You're like a wizard.
[SAMWELL smiles.  Next shot, GILLY and SAMWELL gaze up at the Wall]
GILLY: Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.  Here we are.  Alive.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Scene changes to SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE and ARYA STARK on horseback in the Riverlands, on their way to The Twins, where THE HOUND plans on returning ARYA to her mother and brother in the hopes of receiving some reward.  They see a PIG FARMER along the way who's having trouble with the wheel spokes on his cart]
THE HOUND: Remember what happens to children who run.  I'm your father and I'll do the talking.
[THE HOUND hands the horse reins to ARYA and walks over to the PIG FARMER]
PIG FARMER: The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning.
THE HOUND: Need a hand?
PIG FARMER: Need about eight hands.
[THE HOUND lifts the cart up]
PIG FARMER: Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.
[PIG FARMER fixes the wheel, THE HOUND sets the cart down]
PIG FARMER: Many thanks.
[THE HOUND punches the PIG FARMER in the face, knocking him to the ground.  THE HOUND then unsheathes his dagger and prepares to kill him, prompting ARYA to intervene]
ARYA: Don't! Don't kill him.
THE HOUND: Dead rats don't squeak.
ARYA: You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people.  A real hard man you are.
THE HOUND: More than anyone you know.
ARYA: You're wrong.  I know a killer. A real killer.
THE HOUND: That so?
ARYA: You'd be like a kitten to him.  He'd kill you with his little finger.
[THE HOUND looks at the PIG FARMER on the ground]
THE HOUND: That him?
[Confused, ARYA turns her head to look down at the PIG FARMER]
ARYA: No.
THE HOUND: Good.
[THE HOUND again tries to approach the PIG FARMER in order to kill him but ARYA again intervenes pushing him back]
ARYA: Don't kill him!  Please.  Please don't.
[THE HOUND pauses then sheathes his dagger]
THE HOUND: You're very kind.  Someday it'll get you killed.
[PIG FARMER starts to regain consciousness.  ARYA grabs a piece of wood from the cart and hits him across the face with it, knocking him out again.  She then walks back to the horse as THE HOUND looks on surprised]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Scene changes to the North, south of the wall.  BRAN STARK, RICKON STARK, HODOR, JOJEN REED, MEERA REED and OSHA are walking past a windmill]
OSHA: Where are we?
BRAN: The Gift, I think.  Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night’s Watch for their sustenance and support.  Maester Luwin taught me that.
JOJEN: Doesn’t seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
MEERA: It’s good land and there’s no war up here.  Why leave?
BRAN: Wildlings.
[BRAN looks at OSHA who stares back at him]
BRAN: Sorry.  But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women.
RICKON: Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
[OSHA stares at RICKON who looks back at her]
RICKON: That’s what Old Nan said.
JOJEN: There’s a storm coming.
BRAN: I don’t see any.
[Thunder rumbling, everyone looks up at the sky and at the windmill]
MEERA: It’s as good a place to shelter as any.
[They begin walking back towards the windmill.  OSHA puts her hand on RICKON’S head]
OSHA: We can drink some blood while we wait.  I don’t need much.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Scene changes showing ORELL’S eagle circling over an old horse breeder’s home.  JON SNOW, TORMUND GIANTSBANE, ORELL, YGRITTE are hiding, waiting for ORELL’S scouting report]
ORELL: Only one old man and eight good horses.
TORMUND: What’s one old man doing with eight horses?
JON: He breeds them for the Watch.
YGRITTE: How’s he keep folks from stealing them?
JON: The Watch protects him.
ORELL: Not today they don’t.  He’s selling horses, he’s got some gold in there.
TORMUND: And proper steel.
ORELL: Let’s carve him up.
JON: We just take the horses and go.  The old man’s no threat.
[ORELL looks at TORMUND]
ORELL: I keep telling you.
[YGRITTE looks at JON]
YGRITTE: He’s an old man.  A spear through the heart’s a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
[JON looks at TORMUND]
JON: The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.  They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
TORMUND: I hope so.  Killing crows in their castle is tough.  Killing them out here in the open, that’s what we do.
[TORMUND announces to the rest of the wildlings]
TORMUND: Spread out.  Surround the hut and move in.
[The wildlings run towards the OLD MAN’S home.  JON smacks his sword, Longclaw, against a rock to alert the OLD MAN and his horses. Upon hearing his horses moving about, the OLD MAN steps outside and sees the wildlings running towards his home.  He gets on one of the horses and starts riding off.  YGRITTE preps her bow and arrow, aiming for the OLD MAN]
JON: Ygritte!
[JON intervenes and YGRITTE hits a tree instead]
TORMUND: Clear the barn!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Scene changes to ARYA looking at The Twins.  They’re relatively close.  Meanwhile, THE HOUND eats pig feet by the cart.  ARYA walks back to THE HOUND]
ARYA:  No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all.
[THE HOUND waves a pig’s foot at ARYA]
THE HOUND: Best part of the animal.
[THE HOUND continues to eat while ARYA gazes back at the Twins]
THE HOUND: Don’t worry, they’re still there.
[ARYA angrily turns back and looks at THE HOUND]
ARYA: I know they’re still there.
THE HOUND: You check every five minutes like you’re afraid they’re gonna move.
ARYA: I’m not afraid.
THE HOUND: Of course you are.  You’re almost there and you’re afraid you won’t make it.  The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.  No point in trying to hide behind that face.  I know fear when I see it.  Seen it a lot.
ARYA: I knew fear when I saw it in you.  You’re afraid of fire.
[THE HOUND pauses]
ARYA: When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl.
[ARYA moves in closer to THE HOUND]
ARYA: And I know why, too.  I heard what your brother did to you.  Pressed your face to the fire like you’re a nice juicy mutton chop.
THE HOUND: That give you some ideas?
[ARYA turns her back to THE HOUND]
ARYA: Might do.
THE HOUND: Go ahead then.  You might get away.  Might even make it there on your own.  They’re just over the river.  The closest you’ve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy’s neck.
[ARYA turns around and angrily stares at THE HOUND]
ARYA: Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
[THE HOUND stares back at ARYA as she walks away to get a closer look at the Twins as thunder rumbles in the sky]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Scene changes back to BRAN and company inside of the windmill.  The storm has already begun]
BRAN: How are we going to get past the Wall?  My uncle said it’s 700 feet high.
[OSHA looks at Bran and he looks at her]
BRAN: How did you get past it?
OSHA: Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
BRAN: It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
OSHA: Some climb straight up the ice.
[BRAN looks at HODOR]
BRAN: Even Hodor’s not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
[HODOR visibly scared of the thunder]
HODOR: Hodor!
JOJEN: Nineteen castles guard the Wall.  Only three are still manned.
[HODOR still shaken from the thunder]
Hodor: Hodor!
JOJEN: One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
BRAN: My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
[MEERA looks at Bran]
MEERA: Well, we’ll have to open them up again.
[MEERA gazes outside and sees the OLD MAN on horseback]
OLD MAN: [From outside] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
MEERA: There’s a rider out there.
JOJEN: Just one?
[Thunder rumbles]
MEERA: There’s more.
HODOR: Hodor!
[Horses neighing outside.  OSHA tries to quiet down HODOR]
OSHA: It’s just thunder, sweet giant.
HODOR: Hodor.
OLD MAN: [From outside]  I yield.  I yield.
JOJEN: Wildlings.
[OSHA starts turning her head then gazes outside]
OSHA: [To BRAN and RICKON]  Where’s Shaggydog and Summer?
BRAN: Hunting.
[Thunder rumbles]
HODOR: Hodor!
[HODOR stands up]
JOJEN: Shhh, quiet, Hodor.
HODOR: Hodor!
JOJEN: [To BRAN] Make him shut up.  If they hear us…
BRAN: [To Hodor] Hush, Hodor.  No, no more Hodoring.
[OSHA tries to hold HODOR back but he pushes her aside and starts yelling and moving around anxiously]
HODOR: Hodor!
[HODOR continues Hodoring]
BRAN: Hodor, calm down.
OSHA: You need to keep quiet.
JOJEN: They’re gonna hear us.
[HODOR continues Hodoring.  ORELL hears voices coming out of the windmill.  He stops and looks up]
BRAN: Hodor, be quiet.
[HODOR continues Hodoring]
BRAN: Hodor, calm down.  Hodor, be quiet!
[BRAN’S eyes roll back as he wargs into HODOR.  HODOR stops making noises as he falls to his knees and then falls asleep on the ground.  ORELL is still looking up at the windmill from the outside.  Inside of the windmill, everybody is in shock at what just happened]
MEERA: [To BRAN] What did you do?
Bran: Nothing.  I don’t know.
[The sound of a horse is heard from outside.  OSHA gets near the windmill opening]
RICKON: What’s That?
OSHA: That’s a horse dying.
[Scene shifts to the wildlings who are outside of the windmill with the OLD MAN.  ORELL is still looking up at the windmill]
WILDLING 1: Bring them over here.
WILDLING 2: That was the last of them.  The rest are dead.
ORELL: [To TORMUND] I heard shouting up there.
TORMUND: Thunder.
ORELL: I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
TORMUND: Maybe it's ghosts.
[ORELL’s eagle is seen circling over the windmill.  TORMUND approaches the OLD MAN who is sitting on the ground.  He pulls a knife out on TORMUND, YGRITTE gets her bow and arrow out and aims for the OLD MAN]
TORMUND: That won’t help you, grandpa.
[TORMUND sticks his hand out, asking for the knife.  The OLD MAN gives it to TORMUND, who tosses it aside]
TORMUND: Where you riding?
OLD MAN: Doesn’t matter now, does it?
TORMUND: No, it doesn’t matter now.
ORELL: Cut his throat or he’ll tell the crows we’re here.
[TORMUND unsheathes his sword]
TORMUND: You understand.
OLD MAN: Let me stand at least.
[BRAN and RICKON’S direwolves, Shaggydog and Summer, are seen hiding behind a cart, outside of the windmill]
OLD MAN: Let me go with a bit of dignity.
[TORMUND helps the OLD MAN get up.  He then gets in position for the kill]
Orell: [Looks at JON] Make the crow kill him. [Walks towards JON]  You’re one of us now.  Prove it.
[YGRITTE, TORMUND and the OLD MAN stare back at JON.  The scene changes to back inside of the windmill]
Jojen: [Looks at BRAN]  The wolves are out there.
BRAN: I can’t do it by choice.  I don’t know how.  It happens in my dreams.
JOJEN: You’re a warg, Bran.  It’s in your blood.
BRAN: I can’t.
JOJEN: You just did, with him.
[JOJEN looks at HODOR who is still resting]
JOJEN: A wolf is nothing compared to that.
[Scene switches back to outside of the windmill.  JON unsheathes Longclaw.  He places his sword against the OLD MAN’S neck]
OLD MAN: She looks sharp.
[JON nods his head.  The OLD MAN closes his eyes and starts praying, JON hesitates]
YGRITTE: [Looks at Jon]  Do it.  Do it.
[JON looks back at YGRITTE]
ORELL: Told ya.  He’s still one of them.
TORMUND: Go on, boy.
[JON glares back at TORMUND]
TORMUND: Go on!
[JON raises his sword but hesitates. YGRITTE shoots the OLD MAN in the chest with an arrow, killing him.  This prompts ORELL and TORMUND to reach for their swords]
ORELL: He’s a crow.  He’ll always be a crow.  And here’s his crow wife guarding him.  He’ll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
[JON and YGRITTE are standing side by side in defensive positions]
TORMUND: Kill him!
[YGRITTE prepares to shoot an arrow at either ORELL or TORMUND but JON pushes her to the ground first.  JON, ORELL and the other wildlings have a sword fight while TORMUND runs towards YGRITTE.  She starts yelling and screaming as TORMUND tries to restrain her]
Tormund: He’s one of them!
YGRITTE: No!
TORMUND: Do you hear me?
[YGRITTE bites TORMUND’S arm which causes him to lose his grip on her.  She starts running away but TORMUND grabs her and tackles her to the ground]
TORMUND: You’re not gonna die for one of them.
[Scene switches back to inside of the windmill.  Everybody is looking at BRAN]
JOJEN: Do it.  They’ll find us if you don’t.
[BRAN’S eyes roll back as he wargs into Summer.  Scene goes back outside to JON fighting the wildlings.  Suddenly, the direwolves start attacking the wildlings.  JON continues fighting ORELL until he impales him with Longclaw]
JON: You were right the whole time.
[JON twists his sword as ORELL wargs into his eagle right before dying.  The eagle attacks JON, biting and scratching his face.  JON tosses the eagle aside and makes a run for one of the OLD MAN’S horses.  He starts riding away as TORMUND and YGRITTE look on]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[The scene changes to Yunkai.  DAARIO, JORAH and GREY WORM are outside of the back gate]
DAARIO: When you hear a songbird’s whistle, you come.  I’m a great whistler, the greatest in the land.
[DAARIO approaches the back gate, a guard yells at him in Valyrian]
DAARIO: Daario Naharis.
[The guard lets DAARIO in as JORAH and GREY WORM wait.  In the distance, DAARIO whistles.  JORAH and GREY WORM go through the back gate and into Yunkai.  They see two dead guards and DAARIO sitting down]
DAARIO: That one was quick.
[DAARIO wiping blood off his arakh, a Dothraki blade]
JORAH: There may be others.
DAARIO: I doubt it.  The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
[Suddenly, they’re surrounded by Yunkai guards.  A brief fight ensues.  DAARIO throws a knife by JORAH’S head, killing a Yunkai guard who was behind him.  The trio defeat the first wave of guards]
JORAH: [Addressing DAARIO] That’s what you call a few guards?
[DAARIO smiles at JORAH as more Yunkish guards appear, surrounding the trio]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[The scene changes to right outside of The Twins, where the Stark army are set up in tents and passing the time with some wrestling.  It then switches to inside of The Twins, at the wedding ceremony of EDMURE and WALDER’S daughter, ROSLIN FREY. WALDER walks the bride to the altar, her face is covered with a veil.  EDMURE is standing at the altar, looking worried, as ROBB and his family are looking on.  ROBB turns his head back towards WALDER and ROSLIN, while ROOSE BOLTON stares at ROBB.  As WALDER approaches, he trades glances with ROBB.  When WALDER and ROSLIN finally reach the altar, he removes her veil.  EDMURE'S fear of an ugly bride are put to rest when he finally sees how beautiful ROSLIN is.  ROSLIN gets down on her knees in front of EDMURE]
ROSLIN: Lord Edmure, I hope I’m not a disappointment to you.
[EDMURE helps ROSLIN up]
EDMURE: You’re a delight to me, my lady.
[ROSLIN smiles]
SEPTON: You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
[EDMURE removes his cloak as he goes behind ROSLIN to drape it over her shoulders.  ROSLIN and ROBB trade glances.  ROBB then looks at WALDER who gives him a strange look before grinning.  EDMURE finishes putting the cloak on ROSLIN, then looks at CATELYN who smiles at him.  He walks back to ROSLIN’S side and the SEPTON ties EDMURE and ROSLIN'S hands together]
SEPTON: In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.  Look upon each other and say the words.
[EDMURE and ROSLIN turn to each other]
EDMURE & ROSLIN: Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger.  I am hers (I am his) and she is mine (he is mine) from this day until the end of my days.
[BLACKFISH looks at the ugly Frey women who smile back at him.  He quickly turns around]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Scene changes to inside of the windmill.  It’s nighttime.  OSHA lights a candle]
MEERA: Is that safe?
OSHA: They’re long gone.
BRAN: [Looks at JOJEN] You were right.  I can get inside Summer’s mind whenever I want.
JOJEN: Of course you can.  North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals.  But you did a lot more than that.  You got inside Hodor’s mind.
[Shot of HODOR still resting]
BRAN: They can’t do that north of the Wall?
JOJEN: No one can do that.  Anywhere.
BRAN: [Looks at RICKON]  When I was looking through Summer’s eyes, I saw Jon.
RICKON: Where?
BRAN: He was with the wildlings.  They tried to kill him but he got away.
OSHA: He’ll be heading back to Castle Black then.  That’s where we should go.
BRAN: For all we know, Castle Black’s already under attack.  If this many wildlings got through-
OSHA: I already told you.  I’m not going north of the Wall.
BRAN: Everything Jojen told me is true.  You saw what I did to Hodor.  I have to find the three-eyed raven.
[OSHA grabs BRAN by the hand]
OSHA: Listen to me, little lord.
BRAN: Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to come with me.  It won’t be safe for Rickon.
RICKON: [Surprised] Me? I’m coming with you.
BRAN: No.  You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.  The Umbers are our bannermen.  They’ll protect you.
RICKON: I’m coming with you.  I’m your brother.  I have to protect you.
BRAN: Right now, I have to protect you.
[RICKON'S eyes start tearing up]
BRAN: Robb’s at war and I’m going beyond the Wall.  If something happens to us, you’re the heir to Winterfell.
[RICKON shakes his head with tears in his eyes]
BRAN: [Looks at OSHA]  Will you know how to find the last Hearth?
OSHA: You Southerners build your big castles and you never move.  You’re easy to find.
[RICKON stands up and looks at OSHA]
RICKON: We’re not Southerners.
[RICKON turns around to look at BRAN]
RICKON: And I don’t want to leave you.
OSHA: Shhh.  [She grabs RICKON by the waist and sits him on her lap]  Come here, little soldier.  You and me, we’re gonna have some adventures.
[RICKON starts crying.  BRAN looks at OSHA]
Bran: You don’t have to do any of this.
[RICKON cries as OSHA strokes his hair]
OSHA: Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be.  [To RICKON] Shhh.  We’ll be fine, you and me.  The Umbers are great warriors.  Even I heard about them growing up.  They’ll teach you how to swing a sword.
RICKON: [Crying, looks at OSHA]  I know how to swing a sword.
[OSHA strokes RICKON’S hair and kisses him on the head.  She then gets up and helps RICKON up as well]
BRAN: You’re leaving now?  It’s the middle of the night.
OSHA: I learned to walk in darkness.
[OSHA kisses RICKON on the head again]
OSHA: Say your good-byes, little man.
[RICKON walks one step before dropping to his knees to give BRAN a tight hug.  The Reeds look at BRAN and RICKON and then switch their gaze to OSHA]
Osha: [Looks at the Reeds] Keep this one safe.  [MEERA gives a slight nod]  He means the world to me.
[Final shot of BRAN and RICKON hugging followed by a shot of OSHA and RICKON exiting the windmill, with Shaggydog leading the way]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Scene shifts to DAENERYS’ tent outside of the city of Yunkai.  It’s nighttime and there are Unsullied soldiers surrounding the tent.  The next shot is inside of the tent.  BARRISTAN is having a drink, MISSANDEI presents some food to DAENERYS who is sitting down.  She suddenly gets up and ignores the food, as she approaches BARRISTAN with impatience]
Daenerys: We’ve been waiting a long time. [BARRISTAN looks at her]  Haven’t we?  [BARRISTAN shrugs]  Well I don’t know, you tell me.  How long does it take to sack a city?
[BARRISTAN briefly ponders the question before JORAH, GREY WORM and several Unsullied guards arrive.  JORAH and GREY WORM are both tired and covered in blood]
JORAH: [Looks at DAENERYS]  It was just as you said.  They did not believe until it was too late.  Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
[DAENERYS likes the news but her face suddenly shows some worry]
DAENERYS: And Daario Naharis?
[JORAH’S face goes from a smile to a look of shock.  Suddenly, DAARIO emerges from behind the Unsullied guards, with a Yunkai flag draped over his shoulder and his face covered in blood.  He walks towards DAENERYS and drops to one knee.  He drapes the flag over his knee and looks up at DAENERYS]
DAARIO: The city is yours, my queen.
[DAENERYS starts to smile]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[The scene shifts to the wedding celebration inside of The Twins.  A band is playing music on the balcony of the hall.  WALDER is seated on the high chair at the main table, underneath the balcony where the musicians are playing.  Seated to his left are ROSLIN and EDMURE.  Seated to his right is his wife, JOYEUSE FREY.  Stark men and Frey men and women are celebrating the marriage.  TALISA is seated at a table towards the front, near WALDER'S main table.  Next to her is LOTHAR FREY, one of WALDER'S many sons]
TALISA: [Looking at the band and talking to LOTHAR] They’re good, aren’t they?
LOTHAR: They ought to be because they cost enough.
[ROBB takes a drink and starts laughing.  Next shot is from across the hall, where ROOSE, BLACKFISH and CATELYN are seated, enjoying themselves]
BLACKFISH: Look at the crowd there.
[Seated next to BLACKFISH is WENDEL MANDERLY of House Manderly.  Next to him is BLACK WALDER FREY, another one of WALDER'S sons]
CATELYN: [Looking at EDMURE and talking to BLACKFISH] He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.
[Shot of EDMURE whispering in ROSLIN'S ear as she smiles]
BLACKFISH: The God’s love to reward a fool.
CATELYN: [Laughs] Uncle.
BLACKFISH: What? He’s my nephew, I love him.  And he’s a damned fool.
[CATELYN and BLACKFISH both laugh.  A servant tries to pour some wine into ROOSE'S cup but he covers it with his hand before she can pour anything.  CATELYN looks at ROOSE]
CATELYN: Don’t you drink, Lord Bolton?
ROOSE: Never do, my lady.  Dulls the senses.
BLACKFISH: That’s the point. [Still talking to ROOSE while the servant pours him more wine] Didn’t you marry one of these Frey girls?
ROOSE: Aye.  Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl’s weight in silver as a dowry.  So I have a fat, young bride.
[ROOSE smiles and BLACKFISH laughs.  CATELYN gives ROOSE a serious look]
CATELYN: I hope she makes you very happy.
ROOSE: Well, she’s made me very rich.
BLACKFISH: Pardon, my lord, my lady.  I need to find a tree to piss on.
[BLACKFISH gets up from his seat and begins exiting the hall, as ROBB and TALISA look on]
ROBB: My mother’s alone with Roose Bolton.  I should rescue her.
TALISA: Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I’ve ever met.
ROBB: Be kind.  She’s finally starting to like you.
TALISA: And I like her.  But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there [Looks at EDMURE and ROSLIN], eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey’s hand.
ROBB: Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake.
[TALISA gasps and tries to strike ROBB but he catches her hand]
ROBB: Striking your king is an act of treason.
[ROBB and TALISA look at each other before ROBB tries to kiss her.  TALISA stops him]
TALISA: No, don’t.  Don’t insult them.
WALDER: [Addressing ROBB loudly so everybody can hear] Your Grace.
[Everybody starts knocking on the tables.  WALDER signals for the music and knocking to stop]
WALDER: The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.  But they are not yet man and wife.  A sword needs a sheath [Everybody laughs]. And a wedding needs a bedding [Everybody cheers].  What does my sire say?
EVERYBODY: [Knocking on the tables, chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!
ROBB: [Gets up from his seat and addresses WALDER] If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them.
[Everybody cheers, the band starts playing celebratory music again.  EDMURE smiles, ROSLIN looks concerned.  Men start getting up from their seats and approach the main table]
EVERYBODY: [Chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!
[The men pick up ROSLIN and carry her out of the hall.  The women grab EDMURE and start bringing him out as well. TALISA looks worried when she sees ROSLIN being carried away.  Everybody is cheering on.  The men start removing some of ROSLIN'S clothes while the women start doing the same to EDMURE]
EDMURE: Ho-ho!  Careful now, ladies.  Once you set that monster free, there’s no caging him again [Laughs].
[ROBB looks on smiling and clapping.  TALISA looks at ROBB with a worried look]
EVERYBODY: [Chanting] To bed! To bed! To bed!
[ROOSE and CATELYN look at ROSLIN and EDMURE being carried out of the hall]
CATELYN: Poor girl.
ROOSE: Every bride suffers the same.  I’m sure you endured yours with grace.
CATELYN: Oh, Ned forbade it.  He said it wouldn’t be right if he broke a man’s jaw on our wedding night.
[ROOSE looks at CATELYN and chuckles before walking away]
[ROBB and TALISA watch as the bedding procession is almost finished]
TALISA: That is a very strange custom.
ROBB: I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective.
TALISA: It seems normal to you?
ROBB: It’s tradition. [TALISA stares at ROBB]  Without the bedding ceremony, there’s no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage.
[TALISA puts her hand on ROBB'S shoulder, runs it down his arm, before grabbing his hand and placing it on her stomach]
TALISA: No, but there are other ways of providing proof.
ROBB: Boy or girl?
TALISA: I don’t know.  But if it’s a boy, I know what we should name him.
ROBB: Oh, do you?   It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming.
TALISA: Eddard. [Catches ROBB by surprise] Don’t you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
ROBB: I do.
[ROBB and TALISA kiss.  CATELYN looks on and smiles as BLACK WALDER walks towards the door of the hall to close it.  He walks back and the band starts playing the Lannister song, “The Rains of Castamere.”  The band’s expression is very serious and the song isn’t as cheerful as their previous songs.  CATELYN looks up at the band with a worried expression.  Scene changes to outside of The Twins, Grey Wind is locked up in a kennel, whimpering, sensing something is wrong as Frey soldiers are on the move.  The scene then changes again to the main gate of The Twins, where the tents are set up and men are still celebrating. THE HOUND and ARYA approach the gate, riding the pig farmer’s cart]
THE HOUND: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[Three Frey guards stop THE HOUND and ARYA from entering The Twins]
FREY GUARD: Where are you going?
THE HOUND: Got salt pork for the feast.
FREY GUARD: The feast is over.
THE HOUND: It doesn’t sound like it’s over.
[ARYA watches as Frey soldiers run into the Twins]
FREY GUARD: If I tell you it’s over, it’s over.  [Angrily] Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here.
THE HOUND: Got pig’s feet, too [ARYA looks up].
FREY GUARD: [Infuriated] Are you soft in the head?  Turn this cart around!
[THE HOUND gives up.  As he looks back, he notices that ARYA is not in the cart.  The scene then switches back to the hall inside of The Twins.  WALDER signals for everybody to be quiet.  He addresses ROBB]
WALDER: Your Grace.
[WALDER stands up with a cup in his hand.  Everybody takes a seat except ROBB.  ROOSE returns to the hall and sits next to CATELYN]
WALDER: I feel I’ve been remiss in my duties.
[CATELYN looks scared.  ROOSE slowly turns his head to look at CATELYN.  He's smiling as he looks down at his arm, inviting CATELYN to take a look]
WALDER: I’ve given you meat and wine and music but I haven’t shown you the hospitality you deserve.  My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.
[CATELYN pulls back ROOSE'S sleeve, she sees that he’s wearing chainmail.  She starts gasping as ROOSE stares at her.  She suddenly gets up from her seat and slaps ROOSE across the face, prompting him to run to the other side of the hall]
CATELYN: Robb!
[LOTHAR pulls a knife out of his sleeve and repeatedly stabs TALISA in the stomach from behind.  She starts screaming as ROBB looks on in horror.  As ROBB starts to approach her, the band now have crossbows and they shoot arrows at Robb, hitting him.  The rest of the Frey men in the hall start slaughtering the Stark men.  ROBB is repeatedly shot with arrows and falls to the ground.  TALISA falls to the ground in agony.  CATELYN in shock over ROBB, gets hit in the shoulder by an arrow, making her fall down.  As the massacre continues, WALDER smiles and sips from his cup.  The scene then switches to ARYA sneaking into The Twins.  She hides behind a barrel and watches some Stark men eating with Frey men in front of the kennel that Grey Wind is in]
MAN 1: [Laughing] You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh? [Men laughing]
[ARYA grins]
MAN 2: Feast over yet, is it?
FREY MAN: Aye, it’s over! [Slit’s the throat of a Stark soldier]
[The Frey men kill the Stark men.  They flip over the table and march off as ARYA hides in the shadows of the barrels.  ARYA can hear Grey Wind whimpering as he tries to break out of the locked kennel.  She goes behind the flipped over table and sees Grey Wind jumping up and down.  Suddenly, Frey men appear with crossbows.  Grey Wind growls at them before they shoot him to death.  ARYA is horrified.  She watches as Grey Wind takes his last breath and dies.  She then notices more Frey men emerging from a doorway.  She starts walking towards the doorway until THE HOUND puts his hand on her shoulder and turns her around]
THE HOUND: It’s too late.
[THE HOUND hits ARYA on the back of the head, knocking her out.  He carries her over his shoulder and starts exiting The Twins.  The scene then changes to CATELYN crawling underneath the table at the hall with the arrow still lodged in her shoulder.  She notices JOYEUSE hiding underneath the main table.  ROBB gazes at TALISA laying on the ground with her hand on her bloodied stomach.  He starts crawling towards her.  WALDER notices and signals for everybody to stop]
WALDER: The King in the North arises, heh heh.
[ROBB places one hand on TALISA'S stomach and lifts her head up with his other hand.  She has already died.  CATELYN grabs a dagger and emerges from under the table.  She grabs JOYEUSE by the hair and drags her out from under the main table.  CATELYN presses the dagger against JOYEUSE'S throat as WALDER looks on.  The archers fix their sights on CATELYN]
CATELYN: Lord Walder!  Lord Walder, enough!  Let it end!  Please!  He is my son! [ROBB is still cradling TALISA on the floor]  My first son!  Let him go and I swear that we will forget this!  I swear it by the Old Gods and New!  We will take no vengeance.
WALDER: [Angrily] You already swore me one oath right here in my castle.  You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter!
[ROBB lays TALISA'S head on the ground]
CATELYN: Take me for a hostage but let Robb go!  Robb, get up! Get up and walk out!  Please!  Please!
WALDER: And why I would let him do that?
[CATELYN straightens up and presses the dagger harder against JOYEUSE'S neck]
CATELYN: On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife’s throat!
[ROBB starts to stand up]
WALDER: I’ll find another.
[ROBB turns to CATELYN]
ROBB: Mother.
[CATELYN turns to ROBB with tears in her eyes as ROOSE suddenly reappears in front of ROBB.  He faces ROBB and grabs him by the shoulder]
ROOSE: The Lannisters send their regards.
[ROOSE thrusts a dagger into ROBB'S heart. While still staring at CATELYN, ROBB dies and collapses to the floor next to TALISA.  CATELYN wails loudly while WALDER takes a sip from his cup.  She slits JOYEUSE'S throat with the dagger, killing her.  JOYEUSE falls to the ground with blood spraying from her neck and CATELYN drops the dagger.  She looks on hopelessly, in a dreary daze.  After a long pause, BLACK WALDER finally emerges behind CATELYN and slits her throat, killing her.  She falls to the floor with blood spraying from her neck]
[Cut To Black]
[End Credits.  No music]
EXT: The Twins, Night
ROOSE BOLTON climbs the stairs to the top of the Twins. The sounds of the battle below draw him to the edge.  The Stark camp is engulfed in flames as the battle rages on.
CUT TO: The Stark encampment
The battle outside the castle walls is fierce. Stark bannermen and  Frey forces battle for their lives. Swords clash, and some men are set aflame. One man is strung up by his neck into the trees.
MAN: It's too late.
Man #2: Yah! Yah!
The HOUND rides out from the castle, ARYA slumped in front of him. He surveys the battle and picks up a Stark banner as he rides by. He urges his mount forward and they trot into the flames.
MAN: Go, move out!
The HOUND pauses amidst the blinding smoke and flames. His horse whinnies nerviously. The chants of the Frey men grow louder.
FREY MEN: The King in the North! The King in the North! he King in the North! The King in the North!
Frey men march out of the castle. Mounted behind them, ROBB STARK's headless body has been turned into a grotesque effigy. It is tied roughly onto a post. Grey Wind's head has been mounted to the corpse's shoulders.
FREY MEN: The King in the North! The King in the North!
FREY MAN: Here comes the King in the North! Here comes the King in the North!
ARYA rouses in front of the HOUND. She watches in horror as the Frey men lead the awkward effigy into the yard.
FREY MEN: The King in the North! The King in the North!
FREY MAN: Here comes
ARYA is dejected and the HOUND has fear in his eyes. He spurs the horse forward, and they ride away through the fire and battle. A Stark banner succumbs to the flames.
EXT: King's Landing Garden
SANSA and TYRION stroll side-by-side through the gardens on a beautiful day. SHAE follows, a few paces back. ELDRICK and DESMOND pass, snickering at them
TYRION:  Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
SANSA: What are you doing?
TYRION: I have a list.
SANSA: A list of people you mean to kill?
TYRION: For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand--
SANSA: You should learn to ignore them.
TYRION: My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.
SANSA: You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
TYRION: The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
SANSA: (laughs)
TYRION realizes that SHAE overheard that comment. He looks back, embarrassed, and she returns his look, cooly.
SANSA: So how should we punish them?
TYRION: Who? Whom?
SANSA: Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
TYRION: Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
SANSA: I hear that you're a pervert.
TYRION: I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
SANSA: (chuckles) We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.
TYRION: Lady Sansa!
SANSA: My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
TYRION: Why sheep shift?
SANSA: That's the vulgar word for dung.
TYRION: My lady--
SANSA: Well, you asked me.
PODRICK runs down the steps of the garden, looking for TYRION.
GIRL: Oh! That's him!
PODRICK: My lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council.
INT: The Hand's Chamber  TYRION enters. TYWIN, CERSEI, VARYS and PYCELLE are already seated. JOFFREY walks behind his grandfather, excited and grinning.
TYRION: Killed a few puppies today?
JOFFREY: Show him. Come on, show him.
Hand shaking, PYCELLE offers a scroll to TYRION. He drops it before TYRION can grab it.
PYCELLE: Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers.
Annoyed, TYRION reaches to the floor and snatches the scroll. He reads it. JOFFREY is manic with energy.
TYRION: 'Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
JOFFREY: Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. (to Pycelle) Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
VARYS: Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.
CERSEI: A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
JOFFREY: Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.
TYRION: No. She is no longer yours to torment.
JOFFREY: Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster.
TYRION: Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.
The room goes silent. JOFFREY is aghast at the slight.
JOFFREY: I could have your tongue out for saying that.
CERSEI takes JOFFREY's hand to calm him.
CERSEI: Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
PYCELLE: Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste.
JOFFREY pulls his hand free from his mother's caress.
JOFFREY: I am the king! I will punish you.
TYWIN: Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you.
JOFFREY: My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
Once again, the room goes silent as the depth of the insult sinks in.
TYWIN: The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
CERSEI stands and tries to lead JOFFREY away.
CERSEI: Come along.
JOFFREY: I'm not tired.
CERSEI: We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
CERSEI pulls JOFFREY towards the door.
TYWIN: Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.
JOFFREY: I'm not tired!
CERSEI: Come.
CERSEI and JOFFREY exit. PYCELLE stands, takes the scroll from the table, and shuffles out. Next, VARYS rises smoothly to depart. TYRION cautiously swivels to leave as well.
TYWIN: Not you.
TYRION measures the situation as VARYS exits.
TYRION: You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
TYWIN: You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
TYRION: A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
TYWIN: You really think a crown gives you power?
TYRION sits back down at the table.
TYRION: No. I think armies give you power.
TYWIN: Mm-hmm.
TYRION: Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.
TYWIN: Mm-hmm.
TYRION: Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances.
TYWIN: Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
TYRION: I'm all for cheating. This is war.
TYWIN: But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
TYRION: So that's why you did it? To save lives?
TYWIN: To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.
TYRION: The northerners will never forget.
TYWIN: Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
TYWIN gathers his paper and stands.
TYWIN: I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
TYRION: Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
TYWIN places the papers on his desk, as TYRION approaches.
TYWIN: One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.
TYRION: I will not rape her.
TYWIN: Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
TYRION: Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
TYWIN: The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
TYRION: (smirks)
TYWIN: Does that amuse you?
TYRION: No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.
TYWIN: Easy for me, is it?
TYRION: When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
TYWIN: The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister.
TYWIN walks away.
INT: TYRION's chambers
TYRION enters to find SANSA staring out the window.
TYRION: Sansa.
SANSA turns to him. Her face is wet and swollen from crying. She looks at TYRION with disdain. She turns back to the window, and TYRION lets her be.
EXT: The North
MEERA jogs across the rough landscape, bow in her hand and Summer at her side. She reaches JOJEN, BRAN and HODOR.
MEERA: It's empty.
JOJEN: Let's find a place to sleep.
They walk together.
INT: The abandonded Nightfort, a bit later.
A fire crackles behind HODOR as he looks down into a well. He plays with his echo.
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
BRAN: Don't, Hodor.
HODOR stops and joins the others. MEERA whittles while JOJEN cooks at the fire. BRAN sits pensively, his hand exploring the rough wooden table at his side.
BRAN: Maybe we shouldn't stay.
MEERA: You'd rather be out there?
BRAN: There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
JOJEN: I always quite liked the horrible stories.
BRAN: So did I. Once.
JOJEN moves to sit with the others.
BRAN: You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
MEERA: No. Who's he?
BRAN: Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry.
MEERA: If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat--
BRAN: It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
INT: The Twins, dining hall.
WALDER eats noisily in the large, empty dining hall. ROOSE BOLTON sands nearby. Servants scrub blood from the floor.
WALDER: 'The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter-Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and I'm Lord of Riverrun. (laughs)
ROOSE BOLTON: The Blackfish escaped.
WALDER: An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
ROOSE BOLTON: As you say.
WALDER: They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?
ROOSE BOLTON: You'll be needing a new young girl.
WALDER: Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
ROOSE BOLTON: (grunts)
WALDER: And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.
ROOSE BOLTON: He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant--
WALDER: Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
ROOSE BOLTON: (nods)
WALDER: Well, here's to the Young Wolf! (howls)
ROOSE BOLTON: Forever young.
They both laugh.
WALDER: Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
ROOSE BOLTON: At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
WALDER: Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing.
ROOSE BOLTON: I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.  Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon.
WALDER: Oh. And?
INT: A Dungeon, somewhere.
RAMSAY sits, merrily eating a sausage. THEON is strapped once again to the X-shaped cross.
RAMSAY: Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock.
THEON looks up accusingly at RAMSAY, who mugs a reaction of shock.
RAMSAY: What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
THEON sulks.
RAMSAY: People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
He holds up a pork sausage as a visual aid.
RAMSAY: Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?
RAMSAY shakes the sausage. THEON winces and whimpers. He begins to weep. RAMSAY takes a bite.
RAMSAY: Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
THEON: (cries)
RAMSAY: But my father taught me to aim for their head.
THEON: Kill me.
RAMSAY: Sorry, what?
THEON: Kill me.
RAMSAY: A little louder.
THEON: Kill me!
THEON begins to sob.
RAMSAY: You're no good to me dead. We need you.
RAMSAY rises from the table. He walks to THEON grabs THEON's hair and pulls his head back.
RAMSAY: You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat.
THEON: (groans)
RAMSAY: Stinking meat.
RAMSAY sniffs THEON.
RAMSAY: You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
THEON: Theon Greyjoy.
RAMSAY gives THEON a powerful slap.
RAMSAY: What's your name?
RAMSAY punches THEON harder.
THEON: Please.
RAMSAY grabs THEON's neck with both hands and throttles him.
RAMSAY: What is your name?!
THEON: Reek. My name is Reek.
Satisfied and victorious, RAMSAY releases THEON and walks away. THEON weeps again.
INT: The North, the abandoned Nightfort, night
The wind howls outside. A distant gasp startles BRAN awake.  Summer paces as the gasping continues.
BRAN: Hodor.
HODOR wakes. MEERA draws her knife reflexively as she jumps to consciousness. The gasps continue. Summer growls. Footsteps approach. A figure rises from the well, clanging and groaning. The huge figure enters through the trap door, which clangs shut behind him. MEERA yells and jumps the figure, pinning him to the ground, knife at his throat. It is SAM.
SAM: Don't kill me!
MEERA: Who are you?
GILLY enters, frantic, holding her BABY.
GILLY: Sam! Sam!
MEERA: Who are you?!
GILLY: Gilly. Don't hurt us.
MEERA releases SAM and he gets up from the floor.
JOJEN: Where are you going?
SAM: To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
BRAN: My brother, he's in the Night's--
JOJEN: Shush.
SAM: Who's your brother?
JOJEN: Doesn't matter.
Summer growls. SAM realizes that BRAN has a direwolf.
SAM: You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
BRAN: No, I'm not.
SAM: I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
HODOR: Hodor.
SAM: I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will.
BRAN: Take us north of the Wall.
MEERA sheaths her knife and goes to inspect the well.
SAM: What? Why in the world would you want to go--
BRAN: I don't want to. I have to.
JOJEN: How did you get through the Wall?
MEERA: Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
SAM: Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
GILLY: Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
SAM: If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you.
JOJEN: There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
SAM: What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way.
JOJEN: You saw the white walkers and the army of the dead.
SAM: How do you know all that?
JOJEN: The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
Everyone is silent. Birds call in the distance. The BABY fusses.
SAM: But you're going to stop them?
BRAN: Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to.
EXT: The Iron Islands, day
A lone rider gallops towards the Pyke.
INT: The Pyke
BALON sits at a cluttered table. YARA stands nearby. BALON opens a leather tube to reveal a scroll. He draws out the scroll, and recognizes the wax seal of the Flayed Man. He breaks the seal and unrolls the scroll.
BALON: 'Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home.
YARA carefully unwraps the burlap and twine from around a package. Inside is a small chest. She frees the clasp.
BALON stands as YARA opens the box. She is stonefaced. BALON joins her, and offers a similarly sober reaction.  He returns to reading the scroll.
BALON: 'Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight.
Yara looks at Balon.
BALON: Theon disobeyed my orders.
Yara gives Balon a challenging look.
BALON: The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me.
YARA: He's your son.
BALON: Son? He's not a man anymore.
YARA: He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
BALON: Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
BALON sits by the fire.
YARA: And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
CUT TO: YARA aboard an ironborn ship. The crew stands at attention as she walks past
YARA: (voiceover)  I'm going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.
MAN: Get those ropes!
The crew prepares the ship for travel. The Pyke stands in the distance. YARA is in command.
YARA: (voiceover) I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.
INT: The North, the secret tunnel between the Nightfort and North of the Wall.
BRAN inspects the dragonglass knife.
BRAN: What is it?
JOJEN: Dragonglass.
SAM: We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
Jojen takes a dragonglass knife from SAM, and inspects it.
BRAN: Why? What are they for?
SAM and GILLY exchange a long look.
SAM: Killing white walkers.
MEERA: How do you know that?
GILLY: The walker came for my Baby. And Sam--
MEERA:  But no one's killed a white walker in thousands of years.
SAM: Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.
SAM offers a dragonglass knife to HODOR, who refuses it. BRAN takes it and hands it him.
BRAN: Take it, Hodor.
HODOR looks at the remarkable knife. SAM hands dragonglass arrowheads to MEERA.
SAM: And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us.
BRAN: I wish I could. I really do.
BRAN, HODOR, MEERA and JOJEN walk to the northern exit of the tunnel. SAM and GILLY watch them go.
INT: Dragonstone Dungeon
DAVOS approaches GENDRY's cell. GENDRY sits with his back to the bars.
DAVOS: How are you keeping?
GENDRY: Great. Never better.
DAVOS: It was just a bit of blood.
GENDRY: I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want.
DAVOS: I'm not a highborn.
GENDRY: She called you Ser. I heard it.
DAVOS sits down, mirroring GENDRY on the other side of the bars.
DAVOS: A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
GENDRY: Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help.
DAVOS: I lived below the Street of Flour.
GENDRY: How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
DAVOS: The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
GENDRY: Gin Alley.
DAVOS: The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.
GENDRY: Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me.
DAVOS: If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?
DAVOS: She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that.
They  both chuckle.
GENDRY: So how'd you become a lord?
DAVOS: Oh, that's a long story.
GENDRY: Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.
DAVOS: Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
DAVOS shows GENDRY is half-fingers.
GENDRY: You see? Highborns.
DAVOS: I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
GENDRY: Why did you?
DAVOS: I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
GENDRY: Does he?
DAVOS: He's dead.
DAVOS stands up.
GENDRY: How'd he die?
DAVOS: Following me.
DAVOS exits.
EXT: King's Landing, seaside garden
SHAE stares out at the ships in the harbor. VARYS approaches behind her.
VARYS: When did you come to this strange country?
SHAE: When I was 13.
VARYS: You were only a child.
SHAE: I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
VARYS: You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking.
SHAE: And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
VARYS: She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
SHAE: I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
VARYS: No, I expect not.
SHAE: She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
VARYS: We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister--
SHAE: I have a name.
VARYS: You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
SHAE: What do you want from me, Lord Varys?
Varys hands Shae a small bag of diamonds.
VARYS: Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.
SHAE: Why do you want me to leave?
VARYS moves to leave
SHAE: Lord Varys.
SHAE tosses the bag of diamonds at VARYS's feet.
SHAE: If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.
SHAE exits.
INT: TYRION's chambers, evening
TYRION and PODRICK sit drinking at his table.
TYRION: Keep up.
PODRICK: I don't think I can, my lord.
TYRION pours more wine for each of them.
TYRION: It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.
CERSEI enters from the garden.
CERSEI: Leave.
PODRICK stands and exits.
CERSEI: So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.
CERSEI pours herself some wine.
TYRION: She doesn't deserve this.
CERSEI: Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
TYRION: There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
CERSEI: (chuckles)
TYRION: Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
CERSEI: I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
TYRION: I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
CERSEI: You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
TYRION: So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
CERSEI: So she can have some happiness in her life.
TYRION: You have children. How happy would you say you are?
CERSEI: Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive.
TYRION: Even Joffrey?
CERSEI sits.
TYRION: How long does it go on?
CERSEI: Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
TYRION: Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.
CERSEI: Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
EXT: Riverlands woods
The HOUND and ARYA ride past four laughing Frey soldiers.
FREY SOLDIER: I'm telling you, that's what she did. Sounded like a cow in heat.
FREY SOLDIER #2: Aye, not for long.
FREY SOLDIER #3: That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
FREY SOLDIER: I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body.
ARYA slides off the horse and lands on her feet.
FREY SOLDIER #2: You sewed it on?
FREY SOLDIER: I did.
FREY SOLDIER #2: I bet there were 1,000 men claiming they were the one.
FREY SOLDIER: It was me. And Malcolm and Talbott. Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it. What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone. Give it a nice firm mooring and--
Arya comes up behind the men. They notice her.
FREY SOLDIER: What do you want?
ARYA: Mind if I keep warm?  Frey Soldier #2: Fuck off.
ARYA: But I'm hungry.
FREY SOLDIER: Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?
ARYA: I've got money.
Arya produces the silver Braavosi coin from her belt.
FREY SOLDIER: What kind of coin is that?
ARYA: It's worth a lot.
ARYA drops the coin in front of the FREY SOLDIER.
ARYA: Sorry.
FREY SOLDIER: Little shit.
The FREY SOLDIER reaches down for the coin. ARYA pushes him down by the neck and stabs the FREY SOLDIER repeatedly.
FREY SOLDIER #2: Fool!
The other three soldiers rise to attack, but the HOUND appears to shield her. The Frey Soldiers attack the HOUND. He punches one in the face and slices another across the gut. He dodges a blow and disarms the third. He then dispatches the two soldiers who remain standing. ARYA watches, awestruck. She stands up as the HOUND deals a final blow.
HOUND: Where did you get the knife?
ARYA: From you.
ARYA holds up the knife, emotionless. The HOUND takes it.
HOUND: Is that the first man you've killed?
ARYA: The first man.
HOUND: Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first.
The HOUND walks to the soldier's fire and starts eating their meal. ARYA bends down and picks up her Braavosi coin.
ARYA: (whispers) Valar morghulis.
EXT: The North.
JON cleans his facial wounds in a small pool. His horse grazes nearby. He hears the sound of a bow being drawn. He turns to see YGRITTE, an arrow notched and aimed at him. She is the picture of controlled anger. JON stands and faces her.
JON: Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am.
YGRITTE: (grunts)
JON: I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.
YGRITTE's emotions start to crack.
YGRITTE: You know nothing, Jon Snow.
JON: I do know some things. I know I love you.
YGRITTE grunts and draws her bow harder in rage.
JON: I know you love me. But I have to go home now.
YGRITTE fights back tears. JON turns, and she looses an arrow into  Jon's shoulder. Jon falls to the ground, grunting in pain. YGRITTE notches another arrow as JON lurches up and grabs onto his horse. YGRITTE hesitates. JON mounts and YGRITTE puts an arrow into his leg. JON cries out and spurs his horse. YGRITTE has found her resolve. She notches another arrow. She tracks him and shoots him a third time as he gallops away. She begins to weep.
EXT: Caslte Black courtyard
It is a grey day, and the courtyard is relatively quiet.
CUT TO: Castle Black interior.
MAESTER AEMON sits by the fire. SAM and GILLY stand before him. She cradles her BABY.
SAM: I know how this must look. What I meant was--
GILLY: I swear to you, my lord--
MAESTER AEMON: I'm not a lord, my dear. Not for many, many years. Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles. Among other things. What is your name?
GILLY: Gilly.
MAESTER AEMON: Ah, for the gillyflower. Lovely.
GILLY: Yes, my--
SAM: Maester.
GILLY: Master.
SAM: Maester.
MAESTER AEMON: And the child?
SAM: She hasn't chosen a name yet.
GILLY: His name is Sam.
MAESTER AEMON: Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?
SAM: He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build 500 miles of ice walls 700 feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us.
MAESTER AEMON: Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being. We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall.
GILLY: Thank you Maester. I can cook and clean and I can--
MAESTER AEMON: Good. Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell. I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay.
SAM sits at the writing desk and readies a quill.
SAM: Miles better.
MAESTER AEMON: We had 44 ravens at last count. Make sure they're all fed. Every one of them flies tonight.
INT: Dragonstone
DAVOS sits in a rough-hewn chamber. A pile of sealed scrolls sits on the table in front of him. SHIREEN sits reading a book nearby. DAVOS opens a scroll and tries to read it.
SHIREEN: Night
DAVOS: 'First night of the full moon.' Why is there a G in night?
SHIREEN: I don't know. There just is.
DAVOS: Well, your father's not going to go to that.
SHIREEN sits next to DAVOS. He puts the scroll back on the table.
SHIREEN: My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.
DAVOS: I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
SHIREEN: 'His fangs were as long as bastard swords.'
SHIREEN moves back to the bed.
DAVOS: Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'
SHIREEN: ' Noblemen.'
SHIREEN: What is it?
Bells ring out in the distance. SHIREEN puts down her book.
SHIREEN: Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?
DAVOS: Stay here. Bar the door.
DAVOS stands and exits.
CUT TO: The Dragonstone War Room
MELISANDRE picks up some pieces from the war map. STANNIS is hunched over the table, holding a single scroll. MELISANDRE starts to drop the pieces in the fire, one by one. DAVOS enters.
CUT: Melisandre, Stannis, Davos
STANNIS: The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.
DAVOS: And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
MELISANDRE: I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
DAVOS: Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man.
STANNIS: Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?
DAVOS: Aegon Targaryen.
STANNIS: And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
DAVOS: On the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread.
STANNIS: He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.
DAVOS: You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark--
MELISANDRE: And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
MELISANDRE touches STANNIS's shoulder. He turns, and then walks to face the sea.
DAVOS: His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.
STANNIS: What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
DAVOS: Everything.
STANNIS: The boy must die.
INT: Dragonstone Dungeon, night
DAVOS enters, bearing a torch. He unlocks GENDRY's cell.
GENDRY: What are you doing?
DAVOS: You're leaving.
GENDRY: Is this some kind of trick?
DAVOS: Yes, but not on you.
DAVOS throws a cloak to GENDRY.
CUT TO: Dragonstone shore.
DAVOS and GENDRY walk to a rowboat. DAVOS tosses a bag into the boat and pushes it into the water.
DAVOS: Aim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater.
They wade into the water.
GENDRY: I know not to drink seawater.
DAVOS: Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.
GENDRY: Where should I go?
DAVOS: You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
GENDRY: The gold cloaks are looking for me.
DAVOS: They were looking for me for 20 years. Do they know your face?
GENDRY: No.
DAVOS: I'd worry more about the Red Woman.
Gendry boards the rowboat and sits
DAVOS: The other way.
Gendry turns around in the boat and sits at the oarlocks.
DAVOS: You ever been in a boat before?
GENDRY: No.
GENDRY: You know how to swim?
GENDRY: No.
DAVOS: Don't fall out. Go on.
DAVOS pushes the rowboat away from the shore.
GENDRY: Why are you doing this?
DAVOS: Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.
GENDRY begins to row away.
DAVOS: When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me.
EXT: Castle Black
JON lies slumped on his horse's back as it approaches Castle Black. A GUARD calls from a high walkway.
GUARD: Horse approaching! Halt! Halt!
JON slides off the horse and lies motionless in the snow. The GUARD rushes down
CUT TO: Castle Black courtyard
Two Night's Watchmen drag JON through the courtyard. Others come rushing in to see what is happening. They set JON down and roll him over. SAM and PYP stand over him.
SAM: Jon! Jon! Jon, it's us.
PYP: I don't think he can see us.
JON: Pyp? Sam?
SAM: Hush, now. You're home. Carry him inside. Gently.
They carry JON to the stairs.
EXT: The streets of King's Landing
The market is busy and teeming with daily life. JAIME enters the gate, soiled by days of travel. He marvels at being back in the capitol after so long. BRIENNE follows just behind.
MAN: Out of the way. Step aside, country boy. People working here.
JAIME is quiet and humble. He exchanges a look with BRIENNE, who nods encouragingly. They walk into the clamor.
INT: Cersei's chambers
CERSEI sits, admiring a collection of exotic shells, reliving some memory. JAIME enters quietly behind her.
JAIME: Cersei.
CERSEI looks up and gasps. They measure one another. She notices JAIME's hand. He looks down.
INT: Dragonstone war room
DAVOS stands before some guards. STANNIS and MELISANDRE interrogate him.
STANNIS: You don't deny it?
DAVOS: No. I let him go.
MELISANDRE: Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?
DAVOS: Aye, I do.
MELISANDRE: You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
DAVOS: There has got to be another way.
STANNIS: What other way?! Tell us about this other way.
DAVOS: I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire.
STANNIS: Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die.
DAVOS: I understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me.
MELISANDRE: Take him away.
The guards start to wrestle DAVOS away.
STANNIS: Why am I gonna need you?
Davos produces a scroll and holds it our for  Stannis.
MELISANDRE: My king.
Stannis takes the scroll and reads it.
Stannis hands scroll to Melisandre. She reads it.
STANNIS: When did you learn to read?
DAVOS: Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
Melisandre burns the scroll.
MELISANDRE: This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him.
DAVOS: You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.
STANNIS: I've made my decision.
MELISANDRE: He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.
STANNIS: (chuckles) You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now.
DAVOS and MELISANDRE look at one another.
EXT: Outside Yunkai
DAENERYS, MISSANDEI, JORAH, BARRISTAN and DAARIO stand on  the rocks, surrounded by the Unsullied and the Dothraki. The dragons chitter as they wait outside Yunkai.
BARRISTAN: They will come, Your Grace. When they're ready.
DAENERYS: Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
JORAH: You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.
DAENERYS: People learn to love their chains.
The door opens and a crowd pours out. Each wears a collar around their neck. As they get close to DAENERYS, the Unsullied, as one,  take a defensive position, spears pointed at the crowd. A dragon screaches.
MISSANDEI: (speaking Valyrian) This is Daenerys Targaryen, the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, Mother of Dragons. It is to her you owe your freedom
DAENERYS: No.
DAENERYS surveys the crowd.
DAENERYS: (speaking Valyrian)  You do not owe me your freedom.  I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you.
The crowd is silent until one man, holding his daughter, calls out.
MAN: Mhysa!
DAUGHTER: Mhysa!
The whole crowd joins in the shouting.
CROWD:  Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
DAENERYS: What does it mean?
MISSANDEI: It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi. It means 'mother'.
The crowd steps closer and they continue to call to DAENERYS. The Unsullied take a more threatening stance to hold them back. Panic and fear begin to ripple through the confused crowd. They regain their voice and renew their cries.
CROWD: Mhysa! Mhysa!  Mhysa.
DAENERYS: It's all right. These people won't hurt me.
DAENERYS steps forward  kneels next to her three dragons.
DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Fly.
The dragons screach and launch to the sky. DAENERYS steps down among the Unsullied.
CROWD: Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa.
DAENERYS:  (in Valyrian) Let me pass
DAENERYS walks into the crowd. The touch her gently as she passes through them. They are elated, and they continue to chant to her.
CROWD: Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa. Mhysa!
DAENERYS walks deep into the crowd. They lift her up above them, and she sits on their shoulders as the crowd reaches towards her. They spin slowly and the crowd forms rings around her. She smiles and the crowd tightens into a spiral of adulation. The Unsullied remain in formation. The dragons soar overhead.
