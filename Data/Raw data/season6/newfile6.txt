DAVOS hears GHOST’s howling and exits, then peers across the courtyard and sees JON SNOW’s body. He immediately runs down the steps. He slows as he approaches JON SNOW’s body. Other brothers of the Night’s Watch approach. DAVOS kneels beside JON SNOW’s body.
NIGHT’S WATCHMAN: It’s the Lord Commander!
DOLOROUS EDD and other Night’s Watchmen rush up behind DAVOS.
DAVOS: Help me get him inside.
The other Night’s Watch brothers pick up JON SNOW’s body and carry it away. DAVOS remains, staring at the left over pool of blood.
DOLOROUS EDD wipes the table clean. The other Night’s Watch brothers place JON SNOW’s body on the table. DOLOROUS EDD places his hand on JON SNOW’s wounds, then brushes JON SNOW’s eyes closed.
DOLOROUS EDD: Thorne did this.
DAVOS: How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?
DOLOROUS EDD: Trust? The men in this room.
DAVOS: Does the wolf know you?
DOLOROUS EDD looks at DAVOS over his shoulder and nods.
DAVOS: We need all the help we can get.
As DOLOROUS EDD moves towards the door, someone knocks on it. The Night’s Watch brothers draw their blades.
MELISANDRE (O.S.): Ser Davos.
DOLOROUS EDD looks over his shoulder at DAVOS. DAVOS nods. The Night’s Watch brothers sheathe their swords. DOLOROUS EDD walks to the door and opens it. MELISANDRE enters. DOLOROUS EDD closes the door behind her. MELISANDRE is distressed at the sight of JON SNOW’s body.
MELISANDRE: I saw him in the flames, fighting at Winterfell.
DAVOS: I can’t speak for the flames, but he’s gone.
MELISANDRE touches JON SNOW’s cheek.
ALLISER THORNE sits at the high table among the other leaders of the Night’s Watch. The rest of the Night’s Watch brothers are shouting at each other.
MALE VOICE #1: He was our Lord Commander!
MALE VOICE #2: He never should have been!
ALLISER THORNE pounds his fist three times on the high table, then stands. The room quiets.
ALLISER THORNE: You all know why you’re here. Jon Snow is dead.
NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #1: Who killed him?
ALLISER THORNE: I did.
The Night’s Watch brothers resume shouting.
ALLISER THORNE: And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle.
NIGHT’S WATCHMEN #1: Murderers!
NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #2: Traitors!
The shouting resumes. OLLIE walks up beside the high table. ALLISER THORNE pounds the high table again.
ALLISER THORNE: You’re right!
The shouting stops.
ALLISER THORNE: We’ve committed treason, all of us. Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. I had no love for him. That was no secret. But I never once disobeyed an order. Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night’s Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me. I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night’s Watch. Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night’s Watch. He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before. He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered. Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I’ve no doubt about that. And what he thought was right would have been the end of us. He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it.
The men begin to murmur among themselves.
GHOST nudges JON SNOW’s hand and whimpers.
DAVOS: He’ll have seen we didn’t come. Thorne will have made it official by now. Castle Black is his.
DOLOROUS EDD: I don’t care who’s sitting at the high table. Jon was my friend, and those fuckers butchered him. Now we return the favor.
DAVOS: We don’t have the numbers.
DOLOROUS EDD: We have a direwolf.
DAVOS: It’s not enough. I didn’t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn’t have wanted his friends to die for nothing.
DOLOROUS EDD: If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.
DAVOS: We need to fight, but we don’t need to die. Not if we have help.
NIGHT’S WATCHMAN: Who’s gonna help us?
DAVOS: You’re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.
DOLOROUS EDD’s washes over with realization. He turns to the Night’s Watchman at his side.
DOLOROUS EDD: Bolt the door. Don’t let anyone in. I’ll be back as soon as I can.
DOLOROUS EDD leaves through the door.
RAMSAY (V.O.): She was 11 the first time I saw her.
MYRANDA’s body lies on a table.
RAMSAY: The kennelmaster’s daughter. She smelled of dog. I wasn’t much older, but everybody was already afraid of me. You certainly were.
RAMSAY turns and looks at MAESTER WOLKAN, then looks back at MYRANDA’s body..
RAMSAY: Myranda wasn’t, though. What could I do to her that those hounds couldn’t? She was fearless. There was nothing she wouldn’t do.
RAMSAY stands and places his hand on MYRANDA’s forehead.
RAMSAY: Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over. I wish you could be here to watch.
RAMSAY looks as though he is going to cry.
MAESTER WOLKAN: Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord? Or would you rather the men build a pyre?
RAMSAY: Buried, burned?
RAMSAY walks past MAESTER WOLKAN as he exits the room.
RAMSAY: This is good meat. Feed it to the hounds.
RAMSAY is walking with ROOSE.
ROOSE: Your command of the cavalry was impressive. Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead. Do you know who struck the killing blow?
RAMSAY: No.
ROOSE: A shame.  I’d reward the man.  Still, a great victory. Do you feel like a victor?
RAMSAY and ROOSE stop walking. RAMSAY looks back over his shoulder at ROOSE.
ROOSE: I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark. Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?
RAMSAY: No.
ROOSE walks past RAMSAY into Winterfell’s great hall.
ROOSE: A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North. They won’t back us without Sansa Stark. We no longer have Sansa Stark. You played your games with her. You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they’re both gone.
RAMSAY: I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds. They won’t get far.
ROOSE: I’m glad to hear it. Without Sansa, you won’t be able to produce an heir. And without an heir, well…
ROOSE sits at the dinner table. RAMSAY stares at him, astonished.
ROOSE: ...let’s hope the maesters are right and Lady Walder’s carrying a boy.
EXT. NORTHERN WILDERNESSSANSA and THEON are running through the woods frantically. The barking of dogs can be heard in the distance. SANSA tires. THEON runs back to hear and pulls her onward.
THEON: We can’t stop.
The pair resume running. They happen upon a large, snowy river.
THEON: We have to cross here.
SANSA steps on a patch of thin ice and gasps.
SANSA: I can’t.
THEON: It’s the only way to throw off the hounds.
SANSA: But it’s too cold. I can’t. I won’t make it. I’ll die.
THEON: I’ve seen what his hounds do to a person. This way is better.
THEON guides SANSA into the water. SANSA gasps at the cold. The both wade across.
THEON and SANSA are walking together. They are blue with cold. Barking can no longer be heard. THEON spots something off camera.
THEON: Over here. Come on.
THEON leads SANSA to an overturned tree. Its roots provide shelter from the snow. They sit down under the roots, shivering.
THEON: Sansa. Sansa.
THEON wraps his arms around SANSA. She rests her head on his shoulder and closes her eyes. Dogs barking can suddenly be heard closeby.
THEON: Stay here. I’ll lure them away.
SANSA: No, I won’t make it without you.
THEON: You will. Go north, only north. Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black. He’ll help you.
THEON runs into the woods but is immediately confronted by House Bolton soldiers and hounds.
BOLTON OFFICER: Where is Lady Bolton?
THEON: Dead.
BOLTON OFFICER: Liar.
THEON: She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts. I left her to die in the snow.
The dogs catch SANSA’s scent and begin barking. They lead the soldiers to SANSA under the roots of the tree. SANSA cowers from them.
BOLTON OFFICER: I can’t wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.
One of the soldiers grabs SANSA and pulls her to her feet. A horse whinnies in the distance. The soldiers draw their weapons. BRIENNE and PODRICK ride towards the soldiers with their sword drawn.
BOLTON OFFICER: It’s a bloody woman.
BRIENNE cuts down BOLTON OFFICER as she rides past. PODRICK engages one of the soldiers in mounted combat. BRIENNE faces off with another mounted soldier. Their blades clash, but neither is hit. As BRIENNE rides past him, another soldier knocks her from her horse. She drops her blade but scrambles to retrieve it when she sees a soldier advancing towards her on foot. When she reaches the blade, the soldier kicks her. She retrieves the blade again and stands, engaging him in a swordfight. She cuts him down. A mounted soldier charges at BRIENNE. She jumps and strikes him, causing his horse to fall over, trapping him beneath it. While PODRICK continues his mounted sword fight, THEON grabs the blade of a fallen soldier off the ground. PODRICK cuts down the soldier he is fighting and they both fall from their horses. Another soldier advances on PODRICK, and they begin fighting. BRIENNE crawls over to the man trapped beneath his horse and slits his throat with a dagger. The soldier PODRICK is fighting knocks PODRICK’s sword out of his hand. PODRICK falls to the ground. Just before the soldier is about to strike PODRICK, THEON stabs the soldier from behind. PODRICK stands up. BRIENNE walks over to SANSA. SANSA stands up to confront her. BRIENNE places her blade on the ground in front of SANSA and kneels before her.
BRIENNE: Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again. I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.
SANSA turns at looks at THEON for confirmation. THEON nods his head.
SANSA: And I vow...that you shall always have a place by my hearth and…
PODRICK: Meat and mead at my table.
SANSA: Meat and mead at my table. And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the old gods and the new. Arise.
BRIENNE stands up. SANSA smiles at BRIENNE.
CERSEI is sitting in the dark by a table. The door to her chamber opens and a handmaiden enters.
HANDMAIDEN: Your Grace, I’m sorry to disturb you. A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor.
CERSEI smiles.
CERSEI: Myrcella…
CERSEI runs through the courtyard and out to the harbor. She descends the steps to the harbor where a small boat is coming to shore. Her smile fades. As the small boat gets closer to shore, it is revealed to be carrying JAIME and a casket. CERSEI begins to tear up.
JAIME is standing on the balcony, looking out. A bell tolls in the background. JAIME turns and looks back into CERSEI’s room, then enters it.
CERSEI: Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?
JAIME: Mother.
CERSEI: All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now. Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?
CERSEI begins to tear up.
CERSEI:  I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.
JAIME walks over to CERSEI and kneels in front of her.
CERSEI: I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.
JAIME: Shh, shh. Don’t think about it.
CERSEI: I have to. I have to. It’s not right she has to suffer alone.
JAIME: She’s not suffering. She’s gone. No one can hurt her anymore.
CERSEI (crying): She was good. From her first breath, she was so sweet. I don’t know where she came from. She was nothing like me. No meanness, no jealous, just good.
JAIME: I know.
CERSEI: I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I’m not a monster.
CERSEI: No, I knew this would happen. The witch told me years ago. She promised me three children. She promised me they’d die. “And gold their shrouds.” Everything she said came true. You couldn’t have stopped it. It’s prophecy. It’s fate.
JAIME: You don’t believe that.
CERSEI: Of course I do. You told me yourself when Father died. You said we had to stay together. You said people would try to tear us apart, take what’s ours. That was a prophecy, too. I didn’t listen to you, and everything you said came true.
JAIME places his hand on CERSEI’s cheek..
JAIME: Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn’t us. We’re the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world. And everything they’ve taken from us, we’re going to take back and more.
JAIME embraces CERSEI.
JAIME: We’re going to take everything there is.
SEPTA UNELLA: “The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men. They scream in agony and their shame is so great, they do not feel the flames, for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed, they were saved.”
MARGAERY: I’d like to see my brother.
SEPTA UNELLA: Confess.
MARGAERY: Please. How is he? At least tell me that.
SEPTA UNELLA: Confess.
MARGAERY: I am the queen and I demand to see my brother.
SEPTA UNELLA: Sinners don’t make commands. They make confessions.
SEPTA UNELLA slams the scripture book closed and approaches MARGAERY aggressively.
The door opens and HIGH SPARROW enters.
HIGH SPARROW: Septa Unella.
HIGH SPARROW sighs.
HIGH SPARROW: Our other guests need you.
SEPTA UNELLA exits. HIGH SPARROW walks over to MARGAERY and gently pulls her hair away from her face.
HIGH SPARROW (whispering): There.
MARGAERY looks up at HIGH SPARROW.
HIGH SPARROW: Septa Unella can be overzealous at times. I’ll speak with her.
MARGAERY: My brother, can you tell me how he is?
HIGH SPARROW sits on a stool beside MARGAERY.
HIGH SPARROW: It isn’t Ser Loras that brings me here. Your husband misses you dearly. The love between a man and wife is sacred. It reflects the love the gods have for all of us. But sin leads us away from the sacred. And only confession can purge sin.
MARGAERY: I have nothing to confess.
HIGH SPARROW: So you believe you are pure? Perfect? Wholly without sin?
MARGAERY: None of us are.
HIGH SPARROW: You have started down the path. But you have many miles to go..
HIGH SPARROW exits. MARGAERY hugs her knees.
DORAN: I always envied Oberyn. He lived. He truly lived. Sailed around the world. Fought men from every country. Lay with the most beautiful women alive.
ELLARIA: And men.
DORAN: And men. He experienced everything, while I sat here in Dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed. But that is life. We each have our roles.
DORAN sits in his wheelchair. ELLARIA places a pillow behind him.
DORAN: Oberyn was born to be an adventurer. And I was born to rule.
ELLARIA: The gods are not fools. You would have been a lousy adventurer. And Oberyn, pfft, he would have been a terrible ruler.
A maester approaches.
DORAN (to TYENE): Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?
MAESTER: Prince Doran.
The maester bows and hands DORAN a scroll. DORAN unravels and reads it.
DORAN: The Princess Myrcella…
TYENE produces  a dagger from her boot and stabs AREO in the back, killing him. ELLARIA produces a dagger of her own and stabs DORAN in the chest. The maester tries to run away, but TYENE retrieves her dagger from AREO’s body and throws it into the back of the maester’s neck, killing him. ELLARIA removes her dagger from DORAN’s chest and pushes him to the ground. The remaining guards do nothing.
ELLARIA: When was the last time you left this palace? You don’t know your own people. Their disgust for you. Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing. Oberyn martell butchered, and you did nothing. You’re not a Dornishman. You’re not our prince.
DORAN is bleeding out on the ground. He gasps for air.
DORAN: My son Trystane…
ELLARIA scoffs.
ELLARIA: Your son is weak just like you. And weak men will never rule Dorne again.
DORAN dies.
TRYSTANE is painting an eye on a stone. OBARA and NYMERIA enter. TRYSTANE does not look at them.
TRYSTANE: I told you I’m not hungry.
OBARA: We’re not here to feed you.
TRYSTANE stands and turns around to look at them.
OBARA: We’re here to kill you.
OBARA walks to the opposite side of the room. NYMERIA remains by the door. TRYSTANE reaches for his sword.
NYMERIA: You want her to do it or me?
TRYSTANE: We are family. I don’t want to hurt you.
NYMERIA: Her or me?
TRYSTANE draws his blade and points it at NYMERIA.
NYMERIA: Good.
OBARA: Smart boy.
TRYSTANE steps between the two women, readying himself to fight NYMERIA. OBARA stabs him through the back of his head with her spear.
NYMERIA: You’re a greedy bitch, you know that?
OBARA and NYMERIA exit.
TYRION: We’re never going to fix what’s wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.
VARYS looks over his shoulder at a passing commoner.
TYRION: We’ll be fine. We’re dressed like common merchants.
VARYS: You walk like a rich person.
TYRION: You’ve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
VARYS: You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property. I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.
TYRION: It’s a good thing you’re not a boy anymore...because you have no cock.
A woman is lying in the street holding a baby. TYRION and VARYS approach.
TYRION (speaking Valyrian): For your baby. To eat.
The woman cowers away from TYRION.
VARYS (to TYRION): She thinks you want to eat her baby.
VARYS kneels.
VARYS (speaking Valyrian): His Valyrian is terrible. He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat.
VARYS hands the woman money. She gestures at them to thank them, and they walk on. They walk into a courtyard where “KILL THE MASTERS” is written in red on a wall. Beneath it, “MHYSA IS A MASTER,” is written.
VARYS: Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
TYRION: I know what mhysa means.
VARYS: Who wrote it?
TYRION: Hard to know. Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.
VARYS: The Sons of the Harpy?
TYRION: Very possibly. Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren’t even property to begin with. You can see why they’re unhappy. Of course, it could also be the freed men.
TYRION and VARYS enter a chamber where a red priest is preaching to a group of listeners.
LISTENERS (speaking Valyrian): For the night is dark and full of terrors.
RED PRIEST: The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you, and those who love the darkness chased her away.
TYRION: Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.
VARYS: She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.
RED PRIEST: How will you respond? Will you wring your hands, while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return? Or will you  you take up her flames yourselves? Will you fight for your own salvation, now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you?
TYRION: It’s a problem.
TYRION and VARYS proceed in a much larger courtyard.
TYRION: Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill. Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you. We can’t fight an enemy we don’t know.
VARYS: The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone.
TYRION: And have you started looking for that someone?
VARYS: My little birds have already taken wing. Soon they’ll return, singing songs of men in gold masks.
Men are shouting in the distance. A bell begins to toll. A flood of people run through an archway on the opposite side of the courtyard toward TYRION and VARYS, then run past them. TYRION and VARYS proceed through the archway and into the harbor. Smoke pours from the burning wreckage of all the ships in the harbor.
TYRION: Well, we won’t be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.
DAARIO: Goat?
JORAH: Ram.
DAARIO: You think our friend got him?
JORAH: Don’t know anything else that can melt a ram’s horn.
DAARIO: We’re on the right path, then.
JORAH and DAARIO return to their horses. They proceed across the countryside.
DAARIO: Perhaps she’s tired of being queen. I don’t think she likes it very much.
JORAH: She’s too smart to like it.
DAARIO: Maybe she’s flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us.
JORAH: I’ve been all over the world. There’s no escaping men like us.
DAARIO: There’s no escaping her, eh? You keep coming back. Why?
JORAH: You know why.
DAARIO: isn’t it frustrating wanting someone who doesn’t want you back?
JORAH: Of course it is.
DAARIO: You’re a romantic. I admire that. Sometimes I look at you and I think, “So that’s what I’ll be like when I grow old.”
JORAH: If you grow old.
DAARIO: If I grow old. I hope I do. I want to see what the world looks like when she’s done conquering it.
JORAH: So do I.
JORAH stops his horse. DAARIO proceeds ahead. JORAH pulls back his sleeve and looks at the growing patch of Greyscale on his forearm. The men resume riding in unison. They pull up on a circular swathe of horse tracks. There is a smaller circle of untouched grass in the center of the swathe.
DAARIO: Huh, an army?
JORAH: Not an army. A horde.
JORAH dismounts his horse and walks to the circle of untouched grass.
DAARIO: Dothraki?
JORAH looks down and sees something in the grass. He bends down and retrieves a ring.
JORAH: They have her.
BLOODRIDER #1: Maybe she saw a ghost. My friend’s mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white.
BLOODRIDER #2: Pink people are afraid of the sun. It burns their skin. This one stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white.
BLOODRIDER #1: You think she’s got white pussy hair too? You ever been with a girl with white pussy hair?
BLOODRIDER #2: Only when I was fucking your grandma.
BLOODRIDER #1 chuckles and makes a kissing sound at DAENERYS.
BLOODRIDER #1 (to DAENERYS): I’ll ask Khal Moro for a night with you. What do you think?
BLOODRIDER #2: Pretty eyes, but she’s an idiot.
BLOODRIDER #1: She doesn’t have to be smart to get fucked in the ass.
BLOODRIDER #2: I like to talk when I’m finished. Otherwise, we might as well be dogs.
The Dothraki folk are tending to their affairs. BLOODRIDER #1 and BLOODRIDER #2 escort DAENERYS to KHAL MORO’s tent. KHAL MORO is sitting with his wives and other bloodriders.
BLOODRIDER #2: For you, my Khal. The white-haired girl we found in the hills.
BLOODRIDER #1 pushes DAENERYS towards KHAL MORO. KHAL MORO considers her. The attendants speak in Dothraki.
BLOODRIDER #3: Look at those lips, blood of my blood.
WIFE #1: Blue-eyed women are witches.
WIFE #2: It is known.
WIFE#1: Cut off her head, before she casts a spell on you.
KHAL MORO stands and walks around DAENERYS.
KHAL MORO: Even if I was blind, I’d hear my wives say, “Cut off her head” and I’d know this woman was beautiful. I’m glad I’m not blind. Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time, what is better than that?
BLOODRIDER #3: Killing another Khal?
KHAL MORO: Yes, killing another Khal.
BLOODRIDER #4: Conquering a city and taking her people as slaves, and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak.
BLOODRIDER #3: Breaking a wild horse, forcing it to submit to your will.
KHAL MORO (annoyed): Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time is among the five best things in life.
KHAL MORO grabs DAENERYS by the chest.
DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): Do not touch me.
The bloodriders and wives look at each other. KHAL MORO released DAENERYS.
DAENERYS: I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar of the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.
KHAL MORO and his bloodriders laugh. He places his hand on the back of DAENERYS’ head
KHAL MORO: You are nobody, the millionth of your name, Queen of Nothing, slave of Khal Moro. Tonight I will lie with you, and if the Great Stallion is kind, you will give me a son. Do you understand?
DAENERYS: I will not lie with you. And I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else. Not until the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east.
WIFE #1: I told you she was a witch. Cut off her head.
KHAL MORO: I like her. She has spirit.
DAENERYS: I was wife of Khal Drogo, son of Khal Bharbo.
KHAL MORO takes his hand away from DAENERYS and steps backwards.
KHAL MORO: Khal Drogo is dead.
DAENERYS: I know. I burnt his body.
KHAL MORO: Forgive me. I did not know. It is forbidden to lie with a Khal’s widow. No one will touch you. You have my word.
KHAL MORO draws his blade and cuts DAENERYS’ bindings.
DAENERYS: If you will escort me back to Meereen, I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude.
KHAL MORO: When a Khal dies, there is only one place for his Khaleesi.
KHAL MORO sits down.
WIFE #1: Vaes Dothrak. The Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.
WIFE #2: To live out her days with the widows of dead Khals. It is known.
ARYA: Thank you.
ARYA falls silent and listens to the chatter of the common folk. The waif of the House of Black and White appears carrying two staves.
WAIF: Are you listening, blind girl? Do you hear them talking? Do any of them talk to you? No. So sad.
WAIF holds out one of the staves and throws it at ARYA. ARYA catches it clumsily. WAIF hits ARYA with the other staff, knocking her over.
WAIF: Stand and fight, blind girl.
ARYA stands, holding the staff out in front of her.
ARYA: I can’t see.
WAIF: That’s your problem, not mine.
WAIF strikes ARYA on the leg. ARYA cries out and swings her staff. She misses. WAIF jabs ARYA in the stomach with the end of the staff, then knocks her to the ground. ARYA stands back up and swings her staff. She misses again. WAIF strikes ARYA in the face with her staff twice. The second blow knocks ARYA over. ARYA stands up and swings for a third time. She misses again. WAIF strikes ARYA several more times, then knocks her to the ground again. ARYA tries to get up by leaning on her staff, but WAIF knocks the staff out of her hands.
WAIF: See you tomorrow.
WAIF walks away. ARYA remains on her knees, panting.
ALLISER THORNE: Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight. We are both anointed knights.
DAVOS: Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.
ALLISER THORNE: I will grant amnesty to all brothers who thrown down their arms before nightfall. And you, Ser Davos, I will allow you to travel south, a free man with a fresh horse.
DAVOS: And some mutton. I’d like some mutton.
ALLISER THORNE: What?
DAVOS: I’m not much of a hunter. I’ll need some food if I’m gonna make it south without starving.
ALLISER THORNE: We’ll give you food. You can bring the Red Woman with you if you like. Or you can leave her here with us, whichever you choose. But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.
DAVOS: Thank you, Ser Alliser. We’ll discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer.
ALLISER THORNE and his men leave.
DAVOS: Boys, I’ve been running from men like that ll my life. In my learned opinion, we open that door --
NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #1: And they’ll slaughter us all.
NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #2: They want to come in, they’re gonna come in.
DAVOS: Aye, but we don’t need to make it easy for them.
NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #2: Edd is our only chance.
NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #1: It’s a sad fucking statement if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.
DAVOS: There’s always the Red Woman.
NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #1: What’s one redhead gonna do against 40 armed men?
DAVOS: You haven’t seen her do what I’ve seen her do.
MELISANDRE is sitting at the edge of her bed by a fire. She looks across the room at a small mirror standing on a table, then walks over to it. MELISANDRE gazes into the mirror, then disrobes. She removes her collar. The gemstone in its center glimmers. She places the collar on the table beside the mirror. The mirror’s reflection reveals that her appearance has changed to that of an en extremely elderly woman. MELISANDRE continues to stare at herself in the mirror, then walks back over to the bed and gets under the covers.
CREDITS
THREE-EYED RAVEN is tangled in the roots of the great weirwood. His eyes are pure white. BRAN is lying below the tangle, gripping a single root. His eyes are also pure white.
YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN are sparring with wooden swords in the commons. BRAN and THREE-EYED RAVEN are standing on a balcony above the courtyard, watching. YOUNG NED knocks YOUNG BENJEN to the ground.
YOUNG RODRIK: Give him another go, Ned.
YOUNG NED helps YOUNG BENJEN to his feet.
BRAN (to THREE-EYED RAVEN): That’s my father. And my Uncle Benjen.
YOUNG NED (to YOUNG BENJEN): Keep your shield up or I’ll ring your head like a bell.
YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN begin sparring again. BRAN looks around the commons at the citizens of Winterfell going about their business.
BRAN: They were all so happy.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: So were you once.
YOUNG LYANNA rides into the courtyard on a horse. She circles around YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN.
YOUNG NED: Stop showing off.
YOUNG BENJEN: Lyanna!
BRAN: My Aunt Lyanna. I’ve seen her statue in the crypt. My father never talked about her.
Closeup on THREE-EYED RAVEN. He turns to look at BRAN, but BRAN has already walked away. BRAN walks closer to the group. YOUNG LYANNA is being helped off her horse by YOUNG HODOR.
YOUNG BENJEN: Would you get out of here? We’re sparring.
YOUNG LYANNA: Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?
YOUNG BENJEN: I don’t know.
YOUNG LYANNA turns and looks at YOUNG HODOR.
YOUNG LYANNA: What about him?
YOUNG NED: Wylis, come here.
BRAN turns to look at YOUNG HODOR. THREE-EYED RAVEN reaches BRAN’s side.
BRAN: Hodor?
YOUNG LYANNA walks over to YOUNG HODOR with a wooden sword and shield.
YOUNG BENJEN: But he’s got giant’s blood.
YOUNG NED: And you’ve got training. Sounds like a fair match to me.
YOUNG LYANNA: Benjen always lifts his chin when he’s about to charge.
YOUNG HODOR takes the sword and shield.
YOUNG HODOR: And lowers it when he’s going to dodge, my lady.
BRAN: Hodor talks?
YOUNG HODOR walks over to YOUNG BENJEN. They both ready to commence sparring, but stop when NAN appears.
NAN: You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis. Come along, now. It’s no place for you.
NAN takes YOUNG HODOR by the ear and leads him away.
YOUNG NED: Oh, Nan, look at the size of him. If he ever learned to fight, he’d be unstoppable.
NAN: Well, he’s never going to learn to fight because he’s a stable boy. So leave him be.
THREE-EYED RAVEN (to BRAN): It is time to go.
BRAN: Please, a little longer.
THREE-EYED RAVEN touches BRAN on the shoulder.
BRAN is released from the vision. He gasps, then lets go of the root. The white fades from his eyes. A CHILD OF THE FOREST is sitting nearby, staring at him. He props himself up on his wrists and looks at THREE-EYED RAVEN.
BRAN: You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: It is beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long, you’ll drown.
BRAN: I wasn’t drowning. I was home.
CHILD OF THE FOREST and THREE-EYED RAVEN exchange a glance. BRAN turns to HODOR, who is sitting with his back against a wall.
BRAN: Wylis.
HODOR: Hodor.
BRAN: I saw you as a boy. You could talk. What happened?
HODOR: Hodor.
BRAN: Where’s Meera?
HODOR: Hodor.
HODOR carries BRAN outside and sets him down in the snow. MEERA is sitting in the snow at the base of the great weirwood, staring out at the tundra.
BRAN: You shouldn’t be here. It’s not safe outside the cave.
MEERA: It’s not safe anywhere.
BRAN: I saw that Hodor wasn’t always Hodor.
HODOR: Hodor.
MEERA turns and looks at BRAN.
BRAN: What’s wrong?
MEERA casts her eyes down and looks away.
BRAN: The Three-Eyed Raven says there’s a war coming.
MEERA: And we’re going to fight it in there.
MEERA scoffs and turns away. HODOR picks BRAN up and carries him back inside. A side view of MEERA reveals the same CHILD OF THE FOREST who was watching BRAN, sitting among some stones and frozen shrubbery..
CHILD OF THE FOREST: Brandon Stark needs you.
MEERA: For what? I sit in there and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens.
CHILD OF THE FOREST: He isn’t going to stay there forever. And out there he needs you.
ALLISER THORNE: It’s time, Ser Davos. Open the door and the men inside can rejoin their brothers in peace. We’ll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs. Nobody needs to die tonight.
DAVOS turns to address the Night’s Watch faithfuls.
DAVOS: I’ve never been much of a fighter.
DAVOS walks over to Longclaw, JON SNOW’s sword, and picks it up.
DAVOS: Apologies for what you’re about to see.
DAVOS unsheathes Longclaw. The faithfuls follow suit, drawing their own blades.ALLISER THORNE turns to address a Night’s Watchman.
ALLISER THORNE: Come on.
The Night’s Watchman lifts and large hammer and walks over to the door. He begins slamming the hammer against the door repeatedly. GHOST begins to growl and bark. DAVOS and company ready themselves for battle. After a number of swings, the Night’s Watchman with the hammer breaks a hole in the door. A loud thudding can be heard somewhere behind ALLISER THORNE and company. They turn to see what the noise is. The thudding is coming from one of the courtyard’s main gates. WUN WUN breaks down the gate and the Wildlings led by TORMUND and DOLOROUS EDD rush into the courtyard. The Night’s Watch loyal to ALLISER THORNE have bows drawn at the Wildlings but do not fire. They back up slowly.
ALLISER THORNE: Attack!
ALLISER THORNE draws his sword. A Night’s Watchman charged TORMUND. TORMUND cuts him down. The other Night’s Watch members do not retaliate.
ALLISER THORNE: Fight, you cowards!
A Night’s Watchman on a balcony shoots WUN WUN in the shoulder with a crossbow bolt. WUN WUN turns to face the man, then grabs him by the legs, slams him against a wall, and tosses his body to the ground in front of ALLISER THORNE. The Night’s Watch members allied to ALLISER THORNE begin dropping their weaponry. TORMUND and DOLOROUS EDD approach ALLISER THORNE, swords drawn.
ALLISER THORNE (to DOLOROUS EDD): You fucking traitor.
DOLOROUS EDD: The only traitors here are the ones who shoved their knives into their Lord Commander’s heart.
ALLISER THORNE: For thousands of years the Night’s Watch has held Castle Black against the Wildlings.
TORMUND: Until you.
OLLY shouts and charges at TORMUND with his sword. TORMUND grabs OLLY and disarms him, then tosses him to another man who restrains him. Two men take ALLISER THORNE by the arms.
DOLOROUS EDD: Throw them into the cells where they belong.
The men drag ALLISER THORNE, OLLY, and the Night’s Watch betrayers away. TORMUND, DOLOROUS EDD, and DAVOS enter the room where JON SNOW’s body is. They stare down at him and his wounds.
TORMUND: Took a lot of knives. I’ll have my men get the wood for a fire. Bodies to burn.
STORYTELLER: Right, so there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei, tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.
The commoners laugh.
STORYTELLER: All of a sudden she looks my way. Gives me a little smile like, “Well?” So, all right, you know, I’ve never been shy and I’m blessed down south, so I put it right out. She’s never seen anything like it. I mean, she’s used to her brother, and from what I hear, Jaime Lannister’s half an inch shy of an inch. She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips. Well, you all know me. You know I wouldn’t lie about this.
The STORYTELLER walks into a dark alleyway to relieve himself. He is drunk. GREGOR walks up behind him. The STORYTELLER looks up at GREGOR. GREGOR bounces his head off the wall, killing him, then walks away.
CERSEI is standing in the center of the room,. She pulls a loose thread from the sleeve of her dress and examines it. GREGOR enters. CERSEI walks past him and exits her chamber. GREGOR follows. When they reach the bottom of the steps, they are confronted by a group of the king’s soldiers.
CERSEI: Get out of my way.
KING’S SOLDIER: King’s orders, Your Grace.
CERSEI: What are the king’s orders?
KING’S SOLDIER: He would like you to remain in the Red Keep, Your Grace, for your own protection.
CERSEI: You’re barring me from attending my own daughter’s funeral?
KING’S SOLDIER: Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king’s command, I cannot let you pass.
CERSEI: I would like to speak to my son.
KING’S SOLDIER: He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.
GREGOR grabs the hilt of his sword. The king’s soldiers also take hold of their weapons. GREGOR looks at CERSEI. CERSEI turns and walks back up the stairs. GREGOR follows.
TOMMEN and JAIME are standing beside the body of MYRCELLA. She has funeral stones over her eyes, with painted eyes on them.
TOMMEN: She grew up.
JAIME: Almost.
TOMMEN: Have we caught Prince Trystane’s killers? I expect it was Mother.
JAIME: Your mother wouldn’t do that.
TOMMEN: Yes, she would.
JAIME: Are you angry with her?
TOMMEN: Of course not.
JAIME: Then why didn’t you let her come? She has every right to be here.
TOMMEN: They told me she wouldn’t be allowed in the sept. If she had tried --
JAIME: They’re not putting your mother in a cell ever again. Not while I’m here. Why haven’t you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you.
TOMMEN: Don’t you think I know that? I’m sorry. But I can’t.
JAIME: Why not?
TOMMEN: When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery, what did I do? When they paraded her through the streets like a whore, what did I do?
JAIME: We all fail sometimes.
TOMMEN: The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm. If I can’t even protect my own wife or my own mother, what good am I?
The HIGH SPARROW enters the sept. JAIME takes TOMMEN by the shoulder.
JAIME: Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.
JAIME and TOMMEN to address the HIGH SPARROW.
HIGH SPARROW: Your Grace. Lord Commander.
TOMMEN: I want to see my wife.
HIGH SPARROW: The gods wait for Queen Margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy. The king must wait as well.
JAIME: Go and see your mother, Tommen.
TOMMEN exits.
JAIME: You’re a bold man.
HIGH SPARROW: On the contrary. I fear a great deal. The Father, the Mother, the Warrior.
The HIGH SPARROW approaches MYRCELLA’s body.
HIGH SPARROW: Do you know why we use these stones? To remind us not to fear death. We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next.
JAIME: You must long for the next life.
HIGH SPARROW: In truth, I fear that, too.
JAIME: You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.
HIGH SPARROW: Your sister sought the gods’ mercy and atoned for her sin.
JAIME: What about my sins?
JAIME approaches the HIGH SPARROW.
JAIME: I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back. I killed my own cousin. When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice. What atonement do I deserve?
JAIME grips the hilt of his dagger and partially draws it.
HIGH SPARROW: You would spill blood in this holy place?
JAIME: Oh, the gods won’t mind. They’ve spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.
HIGH SPARROW: Go on, then. I deserve it. We all do. We are weak, vain creatures. We live only by the Mother’s mercy.
A great number of the Faith Militant encircle JAIME and the HIGH SPARROW on the steps of the sept.
JAIME: They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.
HIGH SPARROW: I don’t. They’d never reach me before you struck.
JAIME: I’ve fought against worse odds.
HIGH SPARROW: No doubt many of us would fall. But who are we, hmm? We have no names, no family. Every one of us is poor and powerless. And yet together, we can overthrow an empire.
The HIGH SPARROW walks slowly away from JAIME.
CERSEI is looking over the balcony at King’s Landing. TOMMEN enters her chamber.
TOMMEN: Mother.
CERSEI walks in from the balcony.
CERSEI: Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?
TOMMEN: Gold.
CERSEI: Good. It was always her color.
CERSEI walks over to a side table and drinks a sip of wine. Her back is facing TOMMEN.
CERSEI: I understand. I’m glad to see you.
TOMMEN: I know I should have come sooner. I wanted to. I was wrong.
CERSEI: It’s all right.
TOMMEN: No, it isn’t.
CERSEI turns to face TOMMEN.
TOMMEN: I should have executed all of them. I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrow’s head before I let them do that to you, as you would have for me. You raised me to be strong...and I wasn’t. But I want to be. Help me.
CERSEI: Always.
CERSEI and TOMMEN embrace.
TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are gathered together in council. TYRION pours himself a glass of wine. VARYS tsks at him.
TYRION: If I lost my cock, I’d drink all the time.
TYRION looks at GREY WORM.
TYRION: Meaning no offense. He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes.
VARYS: I do not make dwarf jokes.
TYRION: You think them.
VARYS sighs.
VARYS: So, the fleet. It’s been burned.
GREY WORM: We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything.
TYRION: Surely there’s some good news lurking somewhere.
VARYS: Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.
TYRION: Perhaps they can tell us their secret.
VARYS: The Masters have retaken both cities. Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver’s Bay has returned to the slavers.
TYRION: What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.
MISSANDEI: They are not eating. They haven’t touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.
TYRION: Daenerys is the dragon queen. Can’t very well let the dragons starve, that’s obvious.
GREY WORM: If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?
TYRION: Dragons do not do well in captivity.
MISSANDEI: How do you know this?
TYRION: That’s what I do. I drink and I know things.
TYRION finishes his glass of wine and walks over to the pitcher to pour himself another glass.
TYRION: The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles. Then Daenerys’s ancestors started chaining them up in pens. A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats. They must be unchained or they’ll waste away. Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?
MISSANDEI: Many times.
TYRION: And did they ever harm you?
MISSANDEI: Never.
TYRION: Dragons are intelligent. More intelligent than men according to some maesters. They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies. I am their friend.
VARYS: Do they know that?
TYRION: They will. It’s time they had their supper.
TYRION and VARYS enter the dragons’ holding chamber bearing torches. TYRION begins walking slowly down the steps. VARYS remains at the top. When TYRION reaches the floor, he pauses and stares into the darkness. Faint growling can be heard. TYRION stops and looks back at VARYS momentarily. RHAEGAL and VISERION emerge from the shadows. VISERION lights a fire in his mouth and roars at TYRION. RHAEGAL approaches with a small roar.
TYRION (to RHAEGAL): I’m friends with your mother. I’m here to help. Don’t eat the help.
TYRION chuckles nervously. RHAEGAL growls at TYRION. TYRION approaches cautiously.
TYRION: When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day. I begged him for one of you. “It wouldn’t even have to be a big dragon,” I told him. “It could be little, like me.”
TYRION sets down his torch and gets closer to RHAEGAL.
TYRION: Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard. Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago. I cried myself to sleep that night.
TYRION touches RHAEGAL on the neck.
TYRION: But here you are.
TYRION takes hold of the piston keeping RHAEGAL’s shackle closed and pulls it free. The shackle falls the ground. TYRION turns around to see VISERION growling at him. VISERION exposes his neck to TYRION. TYRION approaches and releases the piston from VISERION’s shackle. RHAEGAL and VISERION return to the shadows. TYRION picks up his torch and hurries up the steps.
TYRION: Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face.
ARYA is sitting on the ground against the wall of a street. The WAIF appears, staff in hand.
WAIF: What’s your name?
ARYA grabs her staff and rushes to her feet. The WAIF smacks ARYA in the face, drawing blood. ARYA approaches the sound of the WAIF’s voice, but the WAIF has already moved to the side.
WAIF: What’s your name?
ARYA: No one.
WAIF: I don’t believe that.
ARYA swings her staff at the WAIF, but misses. The WAIF hits ARYA in the side.
WAIF: You don’t believe that.
ARYA swings her staff at the WAIF again, but misses again. The WAIF hits ARYAoin the other side. ARYA rushes towards the WAIF and trips on some steps, falling to the ground. She grabs her staff and stands back up. The WAIF hits ARYA three more times, knocking her to the ground on the third. ARYA stands up and swings at the WAIF again, and misses for a third time. The WAIF hits ARYA in the face, knocking her to the ground again. ARYA is panting heavily. She returns to her feet, screams, and swings her staff around her many times. The WAIF has disappeared. The Faceless Man, taking on the visage of JAQEN H’GHAR, catches ARYA’s staff mid-swing.
JAQEN: Who are you?
ARYA: No one.
JAQEN: If a girl says her name, a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight.
ARYA: A girl has no name.
JAQEN: If a girl says her name, a man will feed her tonight.
ARYA: A girl has no name.
JAQEN: If a girl says her name, a man will give her eyes back.
ARYA: A girl has no name.
JAQEN releases ARYA’s staff.
JAQEN: Come.
ARYA turns around and walks to her beggar basket.
JAQEN: Leave it. A girl is not a beggar anymore.
ARYA follows JAQEN.
ROOSE, RAMSAY, and LORD KARSTARK are gathered at the dining table, talking. RAMSAY and LORD KARSTARK are standing, while ROOSE remains seated at the head of the table.
LORD KARSTARK: He came upon the bodies on our way here.
ROOSE: Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?
RAMSAY: They obviously had help.
ROOSE: I didn’t think lady Sansa killed them all by herself. Thank you for this report, Lord Kastark.
RAMSAY: We know where she’s going. Her brother’s at Castle Black.
LORD KARSTARK: Ned Stark’s last surviving son?
ROOSE: Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.
RAMSAY: So was I, Father.
LORD KARSTARK: Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door.
RAMSAY: Castle Black isn’t defended on the southern side. And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves. With a small force we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow --
ROOSE: Murder the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch? You’d unite every house in the North against us.
RAMSAY: We don’t need every house in the North. The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks. command more soldiers than all the other houses combined. With their support, none could challenge us.
LORD KARSTARK: The Starks lost my house the day King Rob cut off my father’s head. It’s time for new blood in the North.
ROOSE looks at both his son and lord Karstark. He gets up and stands in front of them.
ROOSE: If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you’ll be treated as a mad dog. Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed.
MAESTER WOLKAN enters and interrupts them.
MAESTER WOLKAN: My lords. Lady Walda has given birth. A boy. Red-cheeked and healthy.
LORD KARSTARK: My congratulations, Lord Bolton.
RAMSAY steps towards his father. They hug.
RAMSEY: Congratulations, Father. I look forward to meeting my new brother.
ROOSE puts his hand on RAMSAY’s shoulder.
ROOSE: You’ll always be my firstborn.
RAMSAY: Thank you for saying that. It means a great deal to me.
RAMSAY stabs ROOSE in the gut with a knife. ROOSE falls to the ground. ROOSE dies. RAMSAY steps away from ROOSE and cleans his knife.
RAMSAY: Maester Wolkan, send ravens to all the Northern houses. Roose Bolton is dead. Poisoned by our enemies.
MAESTER WOLKAN does not respond.
RAMSAY: How did he die?
MAESTER WOLKAN: Poisoned by his enemies.
LORD KARSTARK: You're talking to your lord. Use respect.
MAESTER WOLKAN: Forgive me, my lord.
RAMSAY: Send for Lady Walda and the baby.
MAESTER WOLKAN: She’s resting, my lord.
RAMSAY glares at MAESTER WOLKAN.
MAESTER WOLKAN: At once, my lord.
RAMSAY looks down at ROOSE's body.
RAMSAY is standing alone. LADY WALDA walks to RAMSAY carrying her newborn son.
RAMSAY: There he is.
LADY WALDA: Isn’t he wonderful?
LADY WALDA shows RAMSAY her son.
RAMSEY: May I hold him?
LADY WALDA: Of course.
RAMSAY takes the baby.
RAMSAY: Little brother.
LADY WALDA: Lord Bolton sent for us. Have you seen him?
LADY WALDA reaches for the baby. RAMSAY hands the baby to her.
RAMSAY: Of course. Follow me, Mother.
RAMSAY and LADY WALDA walk to the kennel and enter. RAMSAY opens the gate. The dogs bark. RAMSAY closes the gate and locks it. LADY WALDA looks around.
LADY WALDA: Where is Lord Bolton?
The dogs bark even louder.
RAMSAY (to the dogs): Down!
The baby starts crying. LADY WALDA tries to soothe the baby.
LADY WALDA: It’s all right. Come on, shh.
RAMSAY opens the door of a kennel.
LADY WALDA: It’s cold out here, Ramsay. I need to feed him.
RAMSAY opens the doors of all the kennels one by one.
LADY WALDA: Ramsay, where is your father? Ramsay? Where is Lord Bolton?
RAMSAY walks back over to LADY WALDA.
RAMSAY: I am Lord Bolton.
LADY WALDA looks at her baby.
LADY WALDA: Ramsay. Ramsay, please. I’ll leave Winterfell. I’ll go back to the Riverlands. Please. Ramsay. He’s your brother.
RAMSEY: I prefer being an only child.
RAMSEY whisles at the dogs. They exit their pens and attack LADY WALDA and the baby. LADY WALDA screams. The dogs kill them.
THEON is gathering wood. He glances at SANSA and BRIENNE, who are in conversation. PODRICK is making a fire.
BRIENNE: I saw her with a man. I don’t think he hurt her. She didn’t want to leave him, he didn’t want to leave her.
SANSA: You don’t know which way she went?
BRIENNE: I spent three days looking for her. She disappeared.
SANSA: How did she look?
BRIENNE: She looked good. She wasn’t exactly dressed like a lady.
SANSA smiles.
SANSA: No, she wouldn’t be.
BRIENNE: What happened at Winterfell?
SANSA pauses and tears up.
SANSA: I should’ve gone with you while I had the chance.
BRIENNE: It was a difficult choice, my lady.
BRIENNE looks at THEON.
BRIENNE: We’ve all had to make difficult choices.
THEON stands up and walks away from PODRICK. SANSA stands and walks to THEON.
THEON: We shouldn’t be lighting fires. It’s not safe. He won’t stop hunting us.
SANSA: We just have to make it to Castle Black. Once we’re with Jon, Ramsay won’t be able to touch us.
THEON: Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.
SANSA: I won’t let him. I’ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.
THEON: And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place? The truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded?
SANSA looks to the ground.
THEON: And the truth about Rob, who I betrayed?
SANSA: When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven.
THEON: I don’t want to be forgiven. I can never make amends to your family for all the things that I’ve done. They’ll keep you safer than I ever could.
SANSA: You’re not coming with us?
THEON: I would have taken you all the way to the Wall. I would have died to get you there.
SANSA hugs THEON. They both cry.
THEON: May I take one of the horses?
SANSA: Where will you go?
THEON: Home.
A storm is raging.
YARA and BALON are standing and speaking. BALON stands at the fireplace with his back to YARA.
YARA: The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.
BALON: And the Ironborn who held it?
YARA: They died fighting to a man.
BALON: What is dead may never die.
YARA: What is dead may never die.
YARA places the piece of paper she was reading from on a table.
YARA: But they did and our invasion died with them. Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.
BALON: They we will take more.
YARA: Why? For more pinecones and rocks?
BALON turns around to face YARA.
BALON: Because I order it.
YARA: We can defeat anyone at sea, but we’ll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies.
BALON walks to YARA.
BALON: Not if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish mission.
YARA: I won’t apologize for trying to rescue Theon.
BALON: Then where is he?
YARA: Where is your kingdom? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war. That war is over. The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers. I lost two brothers that day.
BALON: And I lost three sons. The War of the Five Kings, they call it. Well, the other four are dead. When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will.
BALON exits the hall.
Rain is pouring down. BALON begins to cross the unsteady bridge. He leans on the ropes and looks down at the ocean, then sees a cloaked figure on the other side of the bridge.
BALON: Let me pass. You fool, move aside for your king.
HOODED FIGURE: Haven’t I always, brother?
The hooded figure takes off his hood, revealing his identity. He is EURON GREYJOY. BALON walks a few steps closer.
BALON: I thought you’d be rotting under some foreign sea by now.
EURON: What is dead may never die.
BALON does not respond.
EURON: Has the custom changed since I’ve been gone? Aren’t you supposed to repeat the words?
BALON: You can mock our god without my help.
EURON: I don’t mock the Drowned God. I am the Drowned God. From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray.
The wind buffets the bridge back and forth. BALON tries to hold his balance. EURON chuckles.
EURON: You’re old, brother. You've had your time. Now let another rule.
BALON walks towards his brother.
BALON: I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea. They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.
EURON: They did.
BALON: And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues.
EURON: I needed silence.
BALON: What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm?
EURON: I am the storm, brother. The first storm and the last. And you’re in my way.
BALON draws a knife and slashes EURON across the face. EURON throws BALON off the bridge. BALON falls to his death.
Many Ironborn are in attendance for BALON's funeral. AERON GREYJOY and several Drowned Men are gathered around BALON's body. They are performing funeral rites, covering it with rocks, seaweed, and wood. YARA approaches. YARA and the Drowned Men walk BALON's body through the shallows.
AERON: Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves. Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh. Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children.
ALL: What is dead may never die.
YARA: I’m going to find out who did this. I’m going to feed them to the sharks while they live. I swear it by the Salt Throne.
AERON: The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.
YARA: My father would’ve wanted me to rule.
AERON: Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear. Perhaps you'll win. Perhaps you’ll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn. And perhaps not.
MELISANDRE: Come in.
DAVOS enters.
DAVOS: I'm sorry, my lady. I didn’t mean to interrupt.
MELISANDRE: You interrupt nothing.
DAVOS looks at the fireplace and then at MELISANDRE.
DAVOS: I assume you know why I’m here.
MELISANDRE: I will after you tell me.
DAVOS: It’s about the Lord Commander.
MELISANDRE: The former Lord Commander.
DAVOS: Does he have to be?
MELISANDRE looks at DAVOS.
MELISANDRE: What are you asking?
DAVOS: Do you know of any magic...that could help him? Bring him back?
MELISANDRE: If you want to help him, leave him be.
DAVOS: Can it be done?
MELISANDRE: There are some with his power.
DAVOS: How?
MELISANDRE: I don’t know.
DAVOS: Have you seen it done?
DAVOS: But it was. It could be now.
MELISANDRE: Not for me.
MELISANDRE stands and walks away from her chair. DAVOS walks towards her.
DAVOS: Not for you? I saw you drink poison that should’ve killed you. I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.
MELISANDRE: Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie.
MELISANDRE looks at DAVOS.
MELISANDRE: You were right all along. The Lord never spoke to me.
DAVOS: Fuck him, then. Fuck all of them. I’m not a devout man, obviously. Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.
DAVOS comes a step closer to MELISANDRE
DAVOS: I’m not asking the Lord of Light for help.I’m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.
MELISANDRE: I never had this gift.
DAVOS: Have you ever tried?
DAVOS, TORMUND, DOLOROUS EDD, and MELISANDRE are gathered around JON SNOW's body. GHOST is sleeping on the floor. MELISANDRE is performing a ritual on JON SNOW's body. She wrings out a wet cloth with which she cleans out the wounds of JON SNOW. She cuts his hair and beard and throws the hairs in a firepit. Then she places her hands on JON SNOW's chest and utters an incantation in Valyrian. She sighs.
MELISANDRE: Please.
MELISANDRE lets her hands down slowly. She has tears in her eyes and looks to DAVOS. TORMUND scoffs and exits, followed by MELISANDRE and DOLOROUS EDD. DAVOS lingers and stares at JON SNOW's body, but eventually exits. GHOST suddenly wakes up and looks at JON SNOW. JON SNOW's eyes snap open and he gasps for breath.
CREDITS
TITLE SEQUENCEINT. CASTLE BLACK ROOMDAVOS is staring at JON SNOW. JON SNOW slowly sits up on the table, breathing heavily. He turns his head to look at DAVOS. GHOST is standing in front of JON SNOW, also staring at him. JON SNOW looks down at his body and sees his stab wounds. He begins gasping and shaking. DAVOS takes off his cloak and rushes over to JON SNOW. JON SNOW attempts to stand but falters. DAVOS catches JON SNOW and wraps him in his cloak.
DAVOS: Easy, easy. Easy.
DAVOS ushers JON SNOW back into a sitting position. MELISANDRE enters and stares at JON SNOW.
DAVOS: What do you remember?
JON SNOW: They stabbed me. Olly...he put a knife in my heart. I shouldn’t be here.
DAVOS: The lady brought you back.
MELISANDRE approaches JON SNOW and kneels in front of him.
MELISANDRE: Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?
JON SNOW: Nothing. There was nothing at all.
MELISANDRE: The Lord let you come back for a reason. Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be.
DAVOS (to MELISANDRE): Could you give us a moment?
MELISANDRE rises and exits the room. DAVOS closes the door behind her, grabs a stool, and sits down in front of JON SNOW.
DAVOS: You were dead. And now you’re not. That’s completely fucking mad, seems to me. I can only imagine how it seems to you.
JON SNOW: I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. And now I’m back. Why?
DAVOS: I don’t know. Maybe we’ll never know. What does it matter? You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can.
JON SNOW: I don’t know how to do that. I thought I did, but...I failed.
DAVOS: Good. Now go fail again.
DOLOROUS EDD, TORMUND, the faithful Night’s Watch members, and the Wildlings are all gathered in the courtyard, staring up at the entrance to the room JON SNOW was in. JON SNOW emerges on the balcony, supported by DAVOS. He stares out at the crowd, then walks down the steps with the help of DAVOS and begins walking through the crowd. The men on either side part to let him pass. TORMUND walks up the middle to confront JON SNOW.
TORMUND: They think you’re some kind of god. The man who returned from the dead.
JON SNOW: I’m not a god.
TORMUND: I know that.
TORMUND moves closer to JON SNOW and whispers in his ear.
TORMUND: I saw your pecker. What kind of god would have a pecker that small?
JON SNOW and TORMUND both chuckle and embrace. JON SNOW winces, then spies DOLOROUS EDD and begins walking towards him. They embrace, and JON SNOW winces again.
DOLOROUS EDD: Your eyes are still brown. Is that still you in there?
JON SNOW: I think so. Hold off on burning my body for now.
DOLOROUS EDD laughs.
DOLOROUS EDD: That’s funny. You sure that’s still you in there?
Both men laugh.
GILLY is sitting on the edge of a cot with LITTLE SAM. Various crewmembers are going about their business. SAMWELL is huddled over a bucket, quivering. He groans and gags. GILLY approaches him.
GILLY: You all right?
SAMWELL: Yes. Yes, I’m fine.
GILLY: Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?
SAMWELL: I don’t think so.
GILLY: Sea, see. They’re spelled different, but they sound the same.
SAMWELL: Yeah, they do.
GILLY: It was before I learned how to read, obviously.
SAMWELL scrunches up his face.
GILLY: Sam, are you going to be sick?
SAMWELL shakes his head and then vomits into the bucket. GILLY retrieves a water skin and hands it to SAMWELL. He washes out his mouth with water.
GILLY: Won’t be long. We’ll be in the south soon. I’m excited to see Oldtown. Captain says it’s the most beautiful city in Westeros. Are you going to vomit again?
SAMWELL: No. No, no, no. The Citadel doesn’t admit women. There won’t be a place for you there or for Little Sam.
GILLY: I stayed at Castle Black. There’s no women allowed there.
SAMWELL: The Citadel isn’t Castle Black. I don’t have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.
GILLY: I’ll stay in Oldtown, then.
SAMWELL: By yourself? With a baby and no money?
GILLY stands.
GILLY: So if we’re not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?
GILLY: “Wherever you go, I go, too.” That’s what you said.
GILLY returns to LITTLE SAM and sits down on the cot. SAMWELL rises and follows her.
GILLY: Us and everyone else in the world.
SAMWELL: I don’t care about them. Well, no, I do, but I don’t really. I care about you and him.
GILLY: I know that, Sam. And he does, too. You're the only one who ever has.
GILLY places her hand on SAMWELL’s back.
GILLY: If you think it’s for the best, we trust you.
SAMWELL: I’d feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.
GILLY: I’d never do that to the father of my son.
SAMWELL smiles and looks at LITTLE SAM, then vomits into a bucket and coughs.
BRAN: That’s my father.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: The man beside him is Howland Reed, Meera’s father.
The Kingsguard walk past BRAN and THREE-EYED RAVEN.
BRAN: Ser Arthur Dayne.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: The Sword of the Morning.
BRAN: Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.
NED and his companions confront the Kingsguard. ARTHUR stabs his sword into the dirt.
ARTHUR: Lord Stark.
NED: I looked for you on the Trident.
ARTHUR: We weren’t there.
KINGSGUARD: Your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been.
NED: The Mad King is dead. Rhaegar lies beneath the ground. Why weren’t you there to protect your prince?
ARTHUR: Our prince wanted us here.
NED: Where’s my sister?
ARTHUR: I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
ARTHUR and the other Kingsguard put on their helmets.
ARTHUR: And now it begins.
The Kingsguard draw their blades.
NED: No. Now it ends.
NED and his men draw their blades and attack. ARTHUR cuts down HOWLAND. The other Kingsguard runs one of NED’s men through with his sword. NED engages in single combat with the other Kingsguard and stabs him through the throat. NED and his three remaining men surround ARTHUR. NED and his men attack all at once, but ARTHUR deflects all of their blows repeatedly, then repositions himself. He kills one of NED’s men with a downward strike from both of his blades. NED and the two remaining men advance on ARTHUR. ARTHUR deflects their blows again and slices the throat of another man, then runs another through with his blade. NED engages ARTHUR in single combat.
BRAN: He’s better than my father.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: Far better.
BRAN: But Father beat him.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: Did he?
BRAN: I know he did. Heard the story a thousand times.
ARTHUR traps NED’s blade and wrenches it from his hands. ARTHUR makes a motion to strike NED down, but HOWLAND stabs ARTHUR in the back. ARTHUR falls to his knees.
BRAN: He stabbed him in the back.
NED retrieves a sword and slashes ARTHUR with it, killing him. A woman screams from the Tower and NED storms towards it.
BRAN: What’s in the tower?
THREE-EYED RAVEN: That’s enough for one day. We’ll visit again another time.
BRAN: I want to see where he’s going.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: Time to go.
BRAN: Father!
NED stops on the stairs and turns around in the direction of BRAN’s yelling but sees nothing and proceeds up the stairs. BRAN chases after him but is intercepted by the THREE-EYED RAVEN, who touches him on the shoulder.
The white leaves BRAN’s eyes as the vision fades. The THREE-EYED RAVEN is tangled in his roots. A child of the forest looks on. BRAN crawls towards the THREE-EYED RAVEN.
BRAN: Why did you do that? Take me back there. I want to go back.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: No.
BRAN: He heard me.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: Maybe. Maybe he heard the wind.
BRAN: He heard me.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: The past is already written. The ink is dry.
BRAN: What’s in that tower? I want to go back there.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: I’ve told you many times, stay too long where you don’t belong and you will never return.
BRAN: Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?
THREE-EYED RAVEN: You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?
BRAN: So why did you?
THREE-EYED RAVEN: I was waiting for you.
BRAN: I don’t want to be you.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: I don’t blame you. You won’t be here forever. You won’t be an old man in a tree. But before you leave, you must learn.
BRAN: Learn what?
THREE-EYED RAVEN: Everything.
BLOODRIDER (speaking Dothraki):  Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass.
DAENERYS approaches a domed structure. KHAL MORO and two of his Bloodriders are waiting for atop their horses.
KHAL MORO: Welcome home, Khaleesi.
Another Bloodrider ushers DAENERYS into the building. Inside, DAENERYS stands in front of a platform atop which a middle-aged Dothraki woman is standing. A group of younger Dothraki women encircle DAENERYS. They speak in Dothraki.
DOTHRAKI WOMAN: Go.
The Bloodriders who ushered DAENERYS in exit. The older Dothraki woman nods to the younger women, who swarm DAENERYS and remove all of her clothing.
DAENERYS: What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!
One of the younger woman approaches DAENERYS with a simple brown garment, which DAENERYS takes and wears.
DAENERYS: You have made a mistake. One you will regret. I am the wife of the Great Khal.
DOTHRAKI MATRON: We know who you are. I remember you eating the stallion’s heart. Why didn’t you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
DAENERYS: Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons. My place is not here with you.
DOTHRAKI MATRON: You were the wife of the Great Khal. You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side. He didn’t. I was the wife of the Great Khal. Khal Savo. I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side. You’re young. We were all young once. But we all understand the way things are. You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us.
DAENERYS: Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.
DOTHRAKI MATRON: Yes. Immediately after the death of their khal. But you went out into the world. That is forbidden. All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven. They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved. And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo’s silver-haired widow. With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons. It is the best you can hope for, now.
INT. MEEREEN GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOMVARYS is sitting on the steps of the throne, fanning himself. Several Unsullied stand around the perimeters of the room.
VARYS (to an Unsullied): I don’t know how you stand it in all that leather.
Two Unsullied usher a woman into the room.
VARYS: If we could have the room.
All the Unsullied guards exit.
VARYS: You look lovely today, my dear. You really do. How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.
WOMAN: If you’re going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it.
VARYS: I am not a torturer.
VARYS stands.
VARYS: Though it so often is what people deserve.
VARYS approaches the woman.
VARYS: And it does provide answers. But they’re usually the wrong answers. My job is to find the right answers. Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy. I’d like to make you happy, Vala. That’s your name, isn’t it, Vala?
VALA looks away. VARYS chuckles.
VARYS: That’s all right. I know who you are and what you’ve done. You’ve done a lot. You’ve sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do. And you’ve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.
VALA: The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.
VALA: Yes, you’re a true liberator, aren’t you? You won’t torture me, you’ll just threaten my son.
VARYS: Children are blameless. I have never hurt them. Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you. But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen’s soldiers. We both know the penalty for that crime. How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem.
VALA: If I tell you anything, they’ll kill me. So either you kill me or they do.
VARYS: Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem. There is a third option, though. A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos. I’ve already booked passage for a woman and her young son. I’ll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.
VARYS kicks a large brown bag at his feet.
VARYS: Though I’m afraid we’ll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it. Far too heavy for me. The boat sails at dawn. You need to decide now. A new life for you and Dom or…
TYRION, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are sitting together around a table. TYRION smiles at MISSANDEI, and MISSANDEI smiles back. TYRION smiles at GREY WORM, and GREY WORM remains expressionless.
TYRION: What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?
MISSANDEI and GREY WORM look at each other, then at TYRION.
TYRION (to MISSANDEI): You speak 19 languages. You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.
MISSANDEI says nothing.
TYRION: You two, you spend a great deal of time together. What would you be talking about if I weren’t here?
GREY WORM: Patrol. When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied. What we see on patrol. Who we captured on patrol.
TYRION: That’s good. That’s very good.
TYRION stands and carries his wine glass over to the decanter to refill it.
TYRION: But that’s a report. I was thinking more of a conversation. A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms.
MISSANDEI: Who said this?
TYRION: Me. Just now. All right, no conversations. Let’s play a game.
TYRION returns to the table. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI say nothing.
TYRION: You don’t play games, either one of you, ever?
GREY WORM: Games are for children.
MISSANDEI: My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.
TYRION: There, that’s a start.
MISSANDEI: Only the girls.
TYRION: Oh no, no, no. Not that, of course not that. Innocent games, fun games, drinking games.
MISSANDEI: We do not drink.
TYRION: Until you do.
GREY WORM and MISSANDEI look interrogatively at TYRION.
VARYS enters the room.
TYRION: Oh, you took your time.
VARYS: Sorry. I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy. Some things you can’t rush.
MISSANDEI: You found out?
VARYS: The good masters of Astapor. And the wise masters of Yunkai. With help from their friends in Volantis.
TYRION: You see? You don’t even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.
GREY WORM: We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once. We will do it again and execute the Masters.
TYRION: If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?
GREY WORM: If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?
MISSANDEI: We cannot. The Masters only speak one language. They spoke it to me for many years. I know it better than my mother tongue. If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them. May it be the last thing they ever hear.
TYRION nods.
TYRION: You may be right.
GREY WORM: So we will fight them?
TYRION: Possibly.
MISSANDEI: Possibly?
TYRION: It’s a conversation.
TYRION turns to VARYS.
TYRION: Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis?
VARYS: Of course. Man can be fickle, but birds always trust.
A group of Varys' child spies are gathered together. One LITTLE BIRD picks up a model of a planet. Another child plays with an hourglass.
QYBURN: Your eye looks much better, Arthur. How’s your mother’s jaw?
ARTHUR: Better.
QYBURN: And your father?
ARTHUR: No one’s seen him.
QYBURN: And no one will. That worked out rather nicely.
LITTLE BIRD: Will Lord Varys ever come back?
QYBURN: I don’t think so. Do you miss him?
LITTLE BIRD: He was nice.
ARTHUR: He called us his little birds. He gave us sweets.
QYBURN stands up and walks to a table.
QYBURN: It’s funny you should mention that. Guess what I happened to find today. Candied plums from Dorne.
He nods at the boxes. Eeach child picks one. They nibble at the plums.
QYBURN: Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me. All I need in return are whispers.
The door opens. GREGOR walks in, followed by JAIME and CERSEI.
QYBURN: No need to be afraid. This is Ser Gregor. He’s friends with all my friends.
GREGOR looks at the children. They stare at him, motionless.
QYBURN: Run along now.
The children run up the stairs.
CERSEI: Varys's little birds?
QYBURN: Your little birds now, your Grace.
JAIME is admiring GREGOR.
JAIME: What did you do to him exactly? I haven't been able to get a clear answer.
QYBURN: Oh, a number of things.
JAIME: Does he understand what we’re saying? I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place.
GREGOR turns his head to JAIME. JAIME recoils.
QYBURNS: He understands well enough.
JAIME: So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow’s head like a melon.
CERSEI: The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him. Ser Gregor will can’t face them all. And he won’t have to. He’ll only have to face one.
JAIME: Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
CERSEI: Not yet.
JAIME: That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.
CERSEI (to QYBURN): Don’t stop at the city. I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North. If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it. If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear. I want to know who they are. I want to where they are.
QYBURN bows his head to CERSEI.
KEVAN LANNISTER chairs a meeting of the Small Council. MAESTER PYCELLE, MACE TYRELL and LADY OLENNA have all gathered around him.
MAESTER PYCELLE: As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse. I told them all. I told them. He’s arrogant, dangerous. You don’t get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason. And no one listened to my advice, so here we are.
JAIME, CERSEI and SER GREGOR enter the room.
MAESTER PYCELLE: And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination. We never sanctioned this, this experiment. And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --
MAESTER PYCELLE notices the new guests. He farts.
KEVAN: Can I help you?
CERSEI (to LADY OLENNA): Why are you here?
MACE TYRELL: My mother...
LADY OLENNA: I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen’s imprisonment.
CERSEI: Thank you for bringing it up. It’s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.
LADY OLENNA: Margaery is the queen. You are not the queen because you’re not married to the king. I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.
KEVAN (to CERSEI & company): This is a Small Council meeting. You have no position on the Small Council.
JAIME: I’m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council.
CERSEI: Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?
MAESTER PYCELLE: Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King’s council. Of course, that was the Mad King. King Robert saw things differently.
JAIME pushes two chairs to the table. JAIME and CERSEI sit down. MAESTER PYCELLE keeps his mouth. The members of the Council look at JAIME and CERSEI.
CERSEI (to KEVAN): What about Myrcella’s death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?
JAIME: The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne. We've got a lot to discuss. All of us together.
CERSEI: And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it.
KEVAN: No, we cannot make you leave. And you cannot make us stay. Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all.
One by one, KEVAN LANNISTER, LADY OLENNA and MACE TYRELL leave the room. MAESTER PYCELLE picks up his paperwork and shuffles slowly. He then runs out of the door when SER GREGOR looks at him threateningly. JAIME, CERSEI and SER GREGOR are left alone in the room.
The HIGH SPARROW is praying. TOMMEN enters the room with his guards. The HIGH SPARROW stands up.
HIGH SPARROW: Oh, your Grace.
TOMMEN: My mother would like to see her daughter’s final resting place.
HIGH SPARROW: Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace. That’s not possible. Not yet.
TOMMEN: When will it be possible?
HIGH SPARROW: When she's fully atoned for her sins.
TOMMEN: You’ve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city. That wasn’t a full atonement?
HIGH SPARROW: No. She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins.
TOMMEN: I want you to let her see Myrcella’s resting place.
Several Faith Militant gather behind the HIGH SPARROW.
TOMMEN: I am the king.
HIGH SPARROW: You are.
TOMMEN: And what does that mean to you?
HIGH SPARROW: It means a great deal to me. The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world. Do you know who told me that? Your mother.
TOMMEN walks closer to the HIGH SPARROW. He guards tense.
TOMMEN: My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you’ve put her through?
The HIGH SPARROW signs that his guards need to leave. They leave. TOMMEN puts his hand in the air and points to his guards. They leave. HIGH SPARROW closes the book lying on the table behind him.
HIGH SPARROW: How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother’s presence? It was through their own mothers. There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that. But when she speaks of you, the Mother’s love outshines it all. Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world. Because it doesn’t come from this world. But you know that. You’ve felt it. You’ve seen her when she talks to you.
TOMMEN: Yes.
HIGH SPARROW: It’s a great gift. One I never had. Envy. One more thing for me to atone for.
HIGH SPARROW points to a bench in the room.
HIGH SPARROW: You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees.
TOMMEN: Of course.
HIGH SPARROW sighs and sits down.
HIGH SPARROW: When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you.
TOMMEN: I still don’t understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.
HIGH SPARROW: It’s not what I want. It’s what the gods want. They make their will known to us and it’s up to us to either accept or reject it.
The HIGH SPARROW palms the seat next to him.
HIGH SPARROW: Please.
TOMMEN sits down next to him.
HIGH SPARROW: If we’re to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings. A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can. And no one is wiser than the gods.
TOMMEN: My grandfather once said something similar. Except for the part about the gods.
HIGH SPARROW: The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not. As they work through your mother. There’s so much good in all of us. The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.
INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
The WAIF and ARYA are standing on a raised platform. The WAIF scrapes her staff on the floor around ARYA, then pushes the end of it against ARYA's head. ARYA turns around. The WAIF nudges her and she flinches. Cut to the WAIF and ARYA sitting on the ground across from each other.
WAIF: Who are you?
ARYA: No one.
The WAIF hits ARYA with a stick. ARYA falls on the ground but gets up.
WAIF: Who were you before you came here?
ARYA: Arya Stark.
Cut to ARYA and the WAIF on the combat platform.  ARYA tries to fight but the WAIF beats her. ARYA falls to the ground. Her mouth's bleeding. Cut back to the WAIF and ARYA sitting across from each other.
WAIF: Tell me about Arya Stark’s family.
ARYA: Her father was Eddard Stark. Her mother was Catelyn Stark. She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers.
The WAIF corrects her with a whip of the stick. Cut to the fighting platform. The WAIF kicks ARYA's staff back into her grasp. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.
ARYA: Three brothers.
Cut back to the fighting platform. As ARYA speaks each of her brothers' names, the WAIF strikes her.
ARYA (V.O.): Rob, Bran, Rickon. And a half-brother, Jon.
WAIF: And where are they now?
Cut to ARYA standing in front of a small table. Several bowls are filled with powder. A glass bottle stands behind each bowel.
ARYA (V.O.): They may be dead for all a girl knows.
ARYA sniffs one of the bowls of powder, then recoils. She sniffs another bowl and wafts the scent with her hand. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.
WAIF: Tell me about The Hound.
Cut back to the fighting platform.
ARYA (V.O.): Also dead.
ARYA deflects several of the WAIF's blows, but is pushed to the edge of the platform and falls when the WAIF smacks her across the face with her staff.
ARYA: Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.
Cut to the pair sitting across from each other. The WAIF smacks ARYA with the stick.
ARYA: He was not on her list anymore. She’d taken him off it.
WAIF: Why? Didn’t she want him dead any longer?
Cut back to the power table.
ARYA: She did and she did not.
ARYA lifts a spoon of the powder to the jar behind it. The Faceless Man, taking on the form of JAQEN H'GHAR, looks on. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.
WAIF: She sounds confused.
ARYA: Yes, she was.
Cut back to the powder table. ARYA dumps the spoonful of powder in the bottle. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.
WAIF: Who else was on Arya Stark’s funny little list?
Cut back to the fighting platform. The WAIF beats down ARYA repeatedly until ARYA can no longer get up.
ARYA (V.O.): Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey.
The WAIF walks away from ARYA, but stops when ARYA begins to stand up. The WAIF turns back to face ARYA.
WAIF: That’s a short list. That can’t be everyone you want to kill.
ARYA stands up and holds her staff out at the WAIF. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.
WAIF: Are you sure you’re not forgetting someone?
ARYA: Which name would you like a girl to speak?
Cut back to the fighting platform. ARYA and the WAIF exchange blows, but ARYA knocks back the WAIF. JAQN H'GHAR looks on.The WAIF returns with a heavy blow, but ARYA blocks it. The WAIF walks away. ARYA turns to face JAQEN H'GHAR.
ARYA is sitting in front of a fireplace. JAQEN is standing in front of the well in the center of the room.
JAQEN: If a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back.
ARYA: A girl has no name.
JAQEN: Come.
ARYA walks to the well. JAQEN gives ARYA a bowl of water. ARYA hesitates to drink it.
JAQEN: If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear.
ARYA drinks the water. She closes her eyes. She slowly opens them to reveal the blindness has left them. She looks to JAQEN.
JAQEN: Who are you?
ARYA: No one.

A horse and carriage are toting a few members of House Umber towards Winterfell.
RAMSAY and LORD KARSTARK are seated at the dining table. A lady serves them drinks. SMALLJON is standing in front of them.
RAMSAY: The Umbers are a famously loyal house.
LORD KARSTARK: Famously loyal to the Starks.
SMALLJON: And you, Lord Karstark? Your people share blood with the Starks, don’t they?  But here we are. Times change.
RAMSAY: When my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners.
SMALLJON: Your father was a cunt.
RAMSAY: My beloved father, the Warden --
SMALLJON: Your father was a cunt and that’s why you killed him.  I might’ve done the same to my father, if he hadn’t have done me the favor of dying on his own.
RAMSAY: My father was poisoned by our enemies.
SMALLJON: Mmm.
RAMSAY: Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?
SMALLJON: The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.  We’re farther north than any of you fuckers. Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.  I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life.  But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.
RAMSAY: So now you’ve come seeking help?
SMALLJON: We need to help each other.  The colder it gets, the farther South those goat fuckers will roam. Won't take them long to get here.
LORD KARSTARK: You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?
SMALLJON: If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.  He knows this place better than we ever will.
RAMSAY: Pledge your banners to House Bolton.  Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends.
SMALLJON: I’m not kissing your fucking hand.
RAMSAY: Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.
SMALLJON: I’m not doing that either.
RAMSAY: Why would I trust a man who won’t honor tradition?
SMALLJON: Your father honored tradition. Knelt for Robb Stark. Called him King of the North. Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?
RAMSAY: Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.
SMALLJON: Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths. I've got a gift for you.
RAMSAY: A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.
Two hooded people are dragged into the hall.
SMALLJON: A girl, aye.  A wild one.
SMALLJON pulls the hood off one of the people, revealing OSHA. RAMSAY stands up.
RAMSAY: I like them wild.
SMALLJON: And the boy, nice and young. The way Karstark likes them.
LORD KARSTARK stands up. SMALLJON pulls the hood off the other person, revealing RICKON STARK.
RAMSAY: Who’s this?
SMALLJON: Rickon Stark.
RAMSAY: How do I know that’s Rickon Stark?
SMALLJOY retrieves the severed head of Rickon's direwolf SHAGGYDOG and places it on the table. RAMSAY examines the head, looks at SMALLJON, and then smiles at RICKON.
RAMSAY: Welcome home, Lord Stark.
INT. CASTLE BLACK – JON SNOW’S CHAMBER
JON SNOW is sitting by the fireplace. He is looking to the ground. Someone knocks on the door. DOLOROUS EDD walks in.
DOLOROUS EDD: It’s time.
JON SNOW gets up, drops his vest with the stab holes in it on the table, and grabs his sword Longclaw.
CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD
MELISANDRE is standing on a balcony overlooking the courtyard. TORMUND, DAVOS, the wildlings, and the Night's Watch are all in attendance. JON SNOW walks past them, going up the stairs towards the gallows. DOLOROUS EDD accompanies him. BOWEN MARSH, OTHELL YARWICK, ALLISER THORNE, and OLLY are standing on a platform with their hands tied and ropes around their necks. JON SNOW looks up at them.
JON SNOW: If you have any last words, now is the time.
BOWEN MARSH: You shouldn’t be alive. It’s not right.
JON SNOW: Neither was killing me.
OTHELL YARWICK: My mother's still living at White Harbor. Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings.
ALLISER THRONE: I had a choice, Lord Commander. Betray you or betray the Night’s Watch. You brought an army of wildlings into our lands. An army of muderers and raiders. If I had to do it all over knowing where I’d end up, I pray I’d make the right choice again.
JON SNOW: I’m sure you would, Ser Alliser.
ALLISER THRONE: I fought, I lost. Now I rest. But you, Lord Snow, you’ll be fighting their battles forever.
JON SNOW looks at OLLY. OLLY stares back at him, unwavering. JON SNOW turns his back and unsheathes Longclaw. He breathes heavily. JON SNOW cuts the rope. The platform is pulled out from under the traitors’ feet. They are hung. They choke and die. JON SNOW looks at OLLY again. OLLY's face is blue and swollen. JON SNOW sheathes his sword, then walks up to DOLOROUS EDD.
DOLOROUS EDD: We should burn the bodies.
JON SNOW: You should.
JON SNOW takes off his cape and hands it to DOLOROUS EDD.
DOLOROUS EDD: What do you want me to do with this?
JON SNOW: Wear it. Burn it. Whatever you want. You have Castle Black.
JON SNOW walks down the stairs.
JON SNOW: My watch is ended.
Everyone in attendance watches JON SNOW walk away.
CREDITS
Longclaw is lying on a table. DOLOROUS EDD lifts and admires it, then turns to JON SNOW who is putting some items in a bag.
DOLOROUS EDD: Where you gonna go?
JON SNOW: South.
DOLOROUS EDD: What are you gonna do?
JON SNOW: Get warm.
JON SNOW smiles. DOLOROUS EDD places Longclaw on the table.
DOLOROUS EDD: I was with you at Hardhome. We saw what’s out there. We know it’s coming here. How can you leave us now?
JON SNOW: I did everything I could. You know that.
DOLOROUS EDD: You swore a vow.
JON SNOW: Aye, I pledged my life to the Night’s Watch. I gave my life.
DOLOROUS EDD: For all nights to come.
JON SNOW: They killed me, Edd! My own brothers. You want me to stay here after that?
A single horn sounds outside. JON SNOW and DOLOROUS EDD look to the doorway.
MAN (O.S.): Riders approaching!
MAN #2 (O.S.): Open the gate!
The southern gates open. SANSA, BRIENNE, and PODRICK enter the courtyard on horseback. The Night’s Watch and the Wildlings all watfch them. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. The trio dismount from their horses. JON SNOW and DOLOROUS EDD emerge onto a balcony overlooking the courtyard. SANSA slowly spins around until she and JON SNOW lock eyes. JON SNOW descends from the balcony and walks to SANSA. They stare at each other and then embrace.
JON SNOW and SANSA are sitting by the fire. SANSA lifts a bowl to her lips and drinks from it.
SANSA: This is good soup. Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?
JON SNOW: With the peas and onions?
SANSA: Mmm.
JON SNOW: We never should have left Winterfell.
SANSA: Don’t you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, “Don’t go, you idiot.”
JON SNOW: How could we know?
SANSA: I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you. I wish I could change everything.
JON SNOW: We were children.
SANSA: I was awful, just admit it.
JON SNOW chuckles.
JON SNOW: You were occasionally awful. I’m sure I can’t have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.
SANSA: Can you forgive me?
JON SNOW: There’s nothing to forgive.
SANSA: Forgive me.
JON SNOW: All right. All right, I forgive you.
SANSA laughs, then holds out her hand for JON SNOW’s horn of ale. JON SNOW gives it to her. She sips, then coughs. JON SNOW laughs.
JON SNOW: You’d think after thousands of years, the Night’s Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.
SANSA: Where will you go?
JON SNOW: Where will we go? If I don’t watch over you, Father’s ghost will come back and murder me.
SANSA: Where will we go?
JON SNOW: I can’t stay here, not after what happened.
SANSA: There’s only one place we can go. Home.
JON SNOW: Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?
SANSA: We’ll take it back from them.
JON SNOW: I don’t have an army.
SANSA: How many wildlings did you save?
JON SNOW: They didn’t come here to serve me.
SANSA: They owe you their lives.
SANSA stands and walks to a table. She places her bowl down on it.
SANSA: You think they’ll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?
JON SNOW: Sansa.
SANSA: Winterfell is our home. It’s ours and Arya’s and Bran’s and Rickon’s. Wherever they are, it belongs to our family. We have to fight for it.
JON SNOW: I’m tired of fighting.
JON SNOW stands and turns to face SANSA.
JON SNOW: It’s all I’ve done since I left home. I’ve killed brothers of the Night’s Watch. I’ve killed wildlings. I’ve killed men that I admire. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. I fought and I lost.
SANSA: If we don’t take back the North, we’ll never be safe. I want you to help me. But I’ll do it myself if I have to.
MELISANDRE is looking out over the edge of the balcony. DAVOS approaches her.
DAVOS: My lady.
MELISANDRE: Ser Davos.
DAVOS: Will you stay here at Castle Black?
MELISANDRE: I will do as Jon Snow commands.
DAVOS: You serve Jon Snow now?
MELISANDRE: He’s the prince that was promised.
DAVOS: Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis.
MELISANDRE walks away from DAVOS and down into the courtyard. DAVOS follows her.
DAVOS: What happened down there?
MELISANDRE: There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.
MELISANDRE continues to walk away, but DAVOS grabs her arm to stop her.
DAVOS: And Shireen? What happened to the princess?
BRIENNE approaches.
BRIENNE:  I saw what happened. I saw Stannis’ forces defeated in the field.
DAVOS: My lady, I’m Ser Davos Seaworth.
BRIENNE: We’ve met before. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.
BRIENNE stares at MELISANDRE.
DAVOS: That’s in the past now.
BRIENNE: Yes, it’s in the past. It doesn’t mean I forget. Or forgive. He admitted it, you know.
DAVOS: Who did?
BRIENNE: Stannis. Just before I executed him.
BRIENNE walks away. MELISANDRE walks in the opposite direction. DAVOS stares at BRIENNE.
LITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN): The Defender of the Vale!
ROBIN: Uncle Petyr!
ROBIN drops the bow and arrow and runs to LITTLEFINGER. They embrace.
LITTLEFINGER: My lord. Come and see.
LITTLEFINGER ushers ROBIN to the rear of the carriage.
LITTLEFINGER: I missed your name day. Go on.
ROBIN and LITTLEFINGER pull a sheet from the back of the carriage, revealing a cage with a falcon inside. The falcon squawks. ROBIN gasps.
ROBIN: A falcon!
LITTLEFINGER: A gyrfalcon. The greatest and rarest of birds.
YOHN ROYCE: Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.
LITTLEFINGER: Indeed I was.
YOHN ROYCE: And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.
LITTLEFINGER: On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting.
YOHN ROYCE: Do you take me for a fool?
LITTLEFINGER: Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else.
The ensuing conversation momentarily distracts ROBIN from admiring the falcon. YOHN ROYCE approaches LITTLEFINGER slowly.
YOHN ROYCE: Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him.
LITTLEFINGER: Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us. And only his judgment concerns me.
YOHN ROYCE looks to ROBIN.
ROBIN: Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?
The surrounding knights begin to approach YOHN ROYCE. YOHN ROYCE walks closer to ROBIN.
YOHN ROYCE: My lord. My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn. To your father, to your mother, and now to you.
ROBIN: Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?
YOHN ROYCE turns back to look at LITTLEFINGER.
LITTLEFINGER: Lord Royce has served the Vale well. He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career. If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.
YOHN ROYCE turns back to ROBIN.
YOHN ROYCE: You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord.
LITTLEFINGER: I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?
ROBIN: Fine.
YOHN ROYCE bows and walks a few feet away from the engagement.
LITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN): I bring good news. My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell. I expect she’s headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander. But she won’t be safe there, not with the Boltons after her.
ROBIN: She’s my cousin. We should help her.
LITTLEFINGER: That was my instinct as well.
LITTLEFINGER turns and walks towards YOHN ROYCE.
LITTLEFINGER: Our lord has spoken. Gather the Knights of the Vale. The time has come to join the fray.
GREY WORM: You invite the enemy into our city?
TYRION: I did. As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”
TYRION begins walking away. The others follow.
GREY WORM: I don’t make peace with the queen’s enemies. I kill the queen’s enemies.
TYRION: Yes, that’s the military approach. And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach.
TYRION and VARYS begin ascending the stairs to the Great Pyramid.
MISSANDEI: Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her.
TYRION and VARYS turn back to face MISSANDEI and GREY WORM.
TYRION We enter these negotiations with open eyes. Trust me. My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution.
MISSANDEI: How many days were you a slave?
TYRION stammers.
TYRION: Long enough to know.
MISSANDEI: Not long enough to understand.
TYRION and VARYS proceed up the steps. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.
TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are sitting in attendance to three masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION.
YEZZAN: I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor. And somehow you’ve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen. It’s most impressive.
TYRION: And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Here’s to reversals of fortune.
RAZDAL: We came here to meet the queen and instead we’re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.
TYRION: Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want.
BELICHO: We want you to leave Slaver’s Bay. Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.
TYRION: Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward.
RAZDAL: When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them.
MISSANDEI: She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains.
RAZDAL: As they have since the dawn of time.
GREY WORM: Not anymore.
YEZZAN: You think you’re a free man now? You still follow orders. Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn’t mean she’s not a master.
TYRION: Friends, friends, friends, please.
GREY WORM stares intently at YEZZAN.
TYRION: There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing. That is the way of the world. I’m not here to change the way of the world.
YEZZAN: Slavery is the way of our world.
TYRION: You don’t need slaves to make money. There haven’t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you. But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it. So here is the queen’s proposal. Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order.
YEZZAN: What does that mean?
TYRION: Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice.
The masters look at each others.
TYRION: Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices. In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy.
YEZZAN: We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.
TYRION: Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same. I do hope you accept, my friends. You will not receive a better offer.
TYRION picks up a bell from the table beside him and rings it.
TYRION: Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it. And as a parting gift to our honored guests…
Three women enter. Each one sits in the lap of one of the masters.
TYRION: Give freedom a chance. See if it doesn’t taste every bit as good as what came before.
TYRION exits. VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM follow.
A group of commoner representatives are gathered together at the foot of the throne, whispering in Valyrian. TYRION, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM enter on the throne platform.
TYRION (speaking Valyrian): My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time.
MISSANDEI (to TYRION): Perhaps I should translate for you.
MAN #1: We speak the Common Tongue.
TYRION: Excellent.
MAN #2: You met with the slavers today.
TYRION: I did.
MAN #1: Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum. Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.
TYRION: I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.
TYRION begins to descend the steps towards the men. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.
TYRION: But I am not your ruler. I’m not the Breaker of Chains. I’m not the Unburnt. And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.
TYRION and company reach the bottom of the steps so they are face to face with the men.
MAN #1: You are a stranger here. So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
TYRION: Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels --
MAN #2: When does she return?
TYRION: Soon. You have my word.
MAN #1: We don’t know you. We don’t trust you. We know Torgo Nudho. We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.
TYRION: And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations. As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace.
MAN #2: You have made peace with the slavers?
TYRION: We offered terms.
MAN #1 (speaking Valyrian): And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers’ arms and sold us at auction like cattle?
MAN #2 (speaking Valyrian): Missandei, you know what these men are. How can you trust them?
MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian): I do not trust them. I will never trust them.
MISSANDEI pauses and looks at TYRION.
MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian): But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”
TYRION smiles.
TYRION, GREY WORM, and MISSANDEI are walking together.
GREY WORM: Do not use me for your lies.
TYRION: Those men respect you.
GREY WORM: They respect me because they know who I am. They know I am loyal.
TYRION: As do I.
GREY WORM: I am loyal to my queen, not you. If you betray her work, you are my enemy.
TYRION: I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.
MISSANDEI: You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.
TYRION: For a short time.
MISSANDEI: Seven years is not a short time for a slave.
TYRION: You’re right. Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once. War is a horror that should be ended at once. I can’t do both today.
GREY WORM: You are wrong to trust these men.
TYRION: I don’t trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest. They’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.
GREY WORM: You don’t know them. You don’t understand them. We are not human in their eyes. They look at me and see a weapon. They look at her and see a whore.
TYRION: They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness. They’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.
GREY WORM: You will not use them. They will use you. That is what they do.
JORAH and DAARIO are walking to the top of a mountain crag. JORAH lags behind and stops to catch his breath. DAARIO turns back to him.
DAARIO: You all right? Why don’t you sit and catch your breath?
JORAH: I’m fine.
DAARIO chuckles.
DAARIO: I don’t think you could ride the dragon. 20 years ago, maybe.
JORAH: What?
DAARIO: Our queen. She’s wild, you know. Don’t let her size fool you. It’s hard enough for me and I’m a young man. You, I don’t think your heart could take it.
JORAH stares at DAARIO for a few moments and then continues along the path.
DAARIO: Must make you angry that our queen chose me.
JORAH: Makes me sad. You’ll disappoint her before long. She’ll move on.
DAARIO: We’ll all disappoint her before long.
JORAH turns back to face DAARIO.
JORAH: We need each other right now. After we’re done needing each other --
DAARIO: Oh, I don’t want to fight you, Jorah the Andal. What do I have to gain? If I win, I’m the shit who killed an old man. If I lose, I’m the shit who was killed by an old man.
JORAH: You didn’t get much discipline as a child, did you?
DAARIO: None.
JORAH and DAARIO crawl to the edge of the ridge and look below. Vaes Dothrak sprawls across the valley floor.
JORAH: The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway.
JORAH points to the eastern division of Vaes Dothrak, and then to the western division.
JORAH: Eastern Market, Western Market. When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals. That’s where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.
JORAH stands and walks off to the side. He begins undoing his sword belt.
DAARIO: What are you doing?
JORAH: It’s forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
DAARIO: Isn’t it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?
JORAH: If they spot us and we’re unarmed, we’ll say we’re traders heading for the Western Market. But if they see weapons…
DAARIO: You’re asking a dog to hand over his teeth.
JORAH: There’s 100,000 of them down there. We can’t fight our way out. We wait till dark, and then we’ll find her.
DAARIO hands over his weapons, except for his dagger. JORAH holds his hand out for the dagger.
DARRIO: Uh…
DAARIO flips the knife around in his hand.
DAARIO: I’m very attached to this knife.
DAARIO kisses and strokes the knife, then motions to hand it to JORAH. He spots the patch of greyscale on JORAH’s arm through a hole in his sleeve. JORAH pinches the fabric of his sleeve together to cover up the greyscale.
JORAH: Don’t worry. it didn’t touch you.
DAARIO: You know what happens?
JORAH: I know what happens.
DAARIO gestures with the dagger.
DAARIO: I’ll do it myself.
JORAH walks to the side and stares into space.
Dothraki men and women are celebrating in the streets. JORAH and DAARIO are sneaking through the stables. They crouch down in front of a railing and see a Dothraki man and woman fornicating.
DAARIO: I should have been born a Dothraki.
JORAH and DAARIO sneak into an alleyway. They move through the alley, but spot two Dothraki men coming their way. JORAH grabs DAARIO.
JORAH: Come on.
JORAN and DAARIO walk out to greet the Dothraki men. They proceed to speak in Dothraki.
JORAH: My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost. Could you show us the way back?
DOTHRAKI #1: What do you sell?
JORAH: Wine. Come down to my stall tomorrow, I’ll give you a cask of the Arbor’s finest.
DOTHRAKI #1: You’re not merchants.
The Dothraki man inclines his head towards his fellow man.
DOTHRAKI #1: Get the others.
The second Dothraki man runs down the alleyway. DAARIO darts after him. JORAH swings at the first Dothraki man, but misses. The Dothraki man knees him in the face, knocking him to the ground. DAARIO continues to pursue the other Dothraki man. JORAH strikes his foe twice, but both are blocked. The Dothraki man strikes back with a punch to the face that sends JORAH sprawling. In the alley, just before the other Dothraki man reaches the common area, DAARIO grabs him from behind, places his hand over his mouth, and then snaps his neck. JORAH is rebuffed by his foe a third time. He attempts to throw sand in the Dothraki man’s face, but he dodges out of the way. JORAH climbs to his knees, but the Dothraki man grabs him by the throat and begins choking him. DAARIO stabs the Dothraki man from behind, killing him.
DAARIO: Told you, I’m very attached to this knife.
DAARIO tucks the dagger away in his shirt. JORAH climbs to his feet.
DAARIO: You all right?
JORAH: If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us.
DAARIO grabs a large rock and smashes the dead Dothraki man with it several times.
DAARIO: Huh.
DAENERYS is sitting among the Dosh Khaleen. The women whisper among themselves, but the leader sits beside DAENERYS. They begin to speak in Dothraki.
LEADER: Some of them don’t think Dothraki should breed with foreigners. They are stupid old women. They don’t realize that we have always diluted our blood. This one is Lhazareen. Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village. How old were you?
LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Twelve.
LEADER: A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter. How did he show his happiness?
LHAZAREEN WOMAN: He broke my ribs.
LEADER: We are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom. Our lives have meaning.
DAENERYS: That is more than most have.
LEADER: When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night, I hope they let you live out your days with us. The other possibilities are not so pleasant.
DAENERYS: I need to make water.
LEADER: You can’t run from Dothraki. You know this.
DAENERYS: I will never run from Dothraki.
LEADER (to LHAZAREEN WOMAN): Go, show her.
The Lhazareen woman takes DAENERYS outside the temple. They walk together.
DAENERYS: I needed fresh air. The old women stink.
LHAZAREEN WOMAN: They do stink.
DAENERYS: You must have been very young when your Khal died.
LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Sixteen.
DAENERYS: Too bad he didn’t die sooner.
DAENERYS and the Lhazareen woman smile at each other.
LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Yes, too bad.
The pair round a bend to a secluded desert outcropping.
LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Is it true you have three dragons?
DAENERYS: Mm-hmm.
LHAZAREEN WOMAN: And they breathe fire?
DAENERYS: They do. Would you like to see them one day?
LHAZAREEN WOMAN: I am Dosh Khaleen. I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die.
DAARIO grabs the Lhazareen woman from behind, covers her mouth, and places his dagger against her neck. JORAH is standing behind DAARIO.
DAENERYS: No, don’t hurt her.
DAARIO: She’ll give us away.
JORAH: We have to go now.
DAENERYS grabs DAARIO’s dagger-carrying hand, and he drops it away from the Lhazareen woman’s neck.
DAENERYS: We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.
JORAH: All we can do is try.
DAENERYS: No. We can do more than that. And you’re going to help me.
DAENERYS looks at the Lhazareen woman.
DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi. Do not betray me.
The Lhazareen woman nods. DAENERYS looks at DAARIO. DAARIO slowly removes his hand from her mouth.
INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR CELLMARGAERY is sitting in the corner of her cell. SEPTA UNELLA enters, then guides MARGAERY out into the prayer room where the HIGH SPARROW waits. MARGAERY walks into the room and shields her eyes from the sunlight. SEPTA UNELLA pushes MARGAERY to her knees, then exits.
HIGH SPARROW: If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?
MARGAERY: I’d go to my brother, my husband, my family.
HIGH SPARROW: Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power. Seeking out your family means seeking out sin. I’m not maligning you. I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else. My father was a cobbler. He died with I was young and I took over his shop. He was a simple man and he made simple shoes. But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them. Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time. Time most of all. Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.
MARGAERY: Quality takes time.
HIGH SPARROW: Yes. I imagine you’ve worn a year of someone’s life on your back. The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege. I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself. Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better.
MARGAERY: And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness. Book of the Stranger, verse 25.
HIGH SPARROW: You know The Seven-Pointed Star.
MARGAERY: Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.
HIGH SPARROW: Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people. You’re close. But it wasn’t a graveyard. It was a feast. I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all. We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor. I woke before dawn. I could barely stand. Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes. The truth of their bodies laid bare. I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn. And I saw it with perfect clarity. I saw what my sins were. The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position. It was all part of a story. A story I was telling myself about who I was. A collection of lies that would disappear in the light. The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was.
MARGAERY: So what did you do?
HIGH SPARROW: I left to go and find them. I didn’t even put on my shoes. I walked out the door and never went back.
The HIGH SPARROW stands and extends his hand out to MARGAERY.
HIGH SPARROW: Come, let’s go and see him.
MARGAERY: Who?
HIGH SPARROW: Your brother.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR – LORAS’ CELL
MARGAERY enters her brother’s cell. The door closes and locks behind her. Loras is lying on the floor.
MARGAERY: Loras. Loras.
MARGAERY helps LORAS to his knees. He cries.
MARGAERY: Listen to me. You need to stay strong.
LORAS: I can’t stay strong. I never was strong.
MARGAERY: You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family.
LORAS: I don’t care about that.
LORAS: I just want it to stop. Help me.
MARGAERY: They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That’s why he’s letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win.
LORAS: Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.
LORAS begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.
MARGAERY: All right.
CUT TO: RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER
CERSEI is walking down the hall to TOMMEN’s chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
MAESTER PYCELLE: And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that’s the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without.
CERSEI enters the room
CERSEI: What are you doing here?
MAESTER PYCELLE: I am advising the king on our current predicament.
CERSEi: Leave.
MAESTER PYCELL: I am a member of the Small Council. The king’s small --
CERSEI: Is this a Small Council meeting?
MAESTER PYCELL: Obviously not. I’m here to lend my wisdom and my support.
TOMMEN: Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now.
MAESTER PYCELL: Your Grace.
MAESTER PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door.
CERSEI: Since I’ve missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things.
TOMMEN: I’ve been thinking about the High Sparrow.
CERSEI: As have we all, unfortunately.
TOMMEN: We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can’t put her at risk. He’s dangerous.
CERSEI takes TOMMEN by the chin.
CERSEI: Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king’s own mother?
TOMMEN looks down.
CERSEI: It’s all right. It's done. It’s in the past. And of course Margaery’s safety is paramount.
TOMMEN: You don’t like Margaery, do you?
CERSEI: Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone’s. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing.
TOMMEN: Mother...there’s something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
CERSEI: You’ve spoken with him?
TOMMEN: I promised him I wouldn’t tell anyone. If he found out I told --
CERSEI: It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me.
CUT TO: RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER
KEVAN and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.
CERSEI: The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders.
KEVIN and LADY OLENNA stand up.
LADY OLENNA: I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You’re not welcome.
CERSEI: You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals.
LADY OLENNA: My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What’s left to work with?
JAIME: Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king’s ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
CERSEI: The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he’ll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city.
LADY OLENNA: Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen.
CERSEi: I agree.
JAIME (to KEVAN): You’ve got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery’s humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody.
KEVAN:  The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen’s safety.
JAIME:  You’ll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?
KEVAN: No, but if the king should call on me --
JAIME:  The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen’s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?
CERSEI: You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they’ve done to your son.  Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
KEVAN: Of course I want him back.
CERSEI: Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
KEVAN: If it doesn’t go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We’ll have civil war. Many will die.
LADY OLENNA: Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.
CUT TO: PYKE CASTLE – GREAT HALL
THEON enters. YARA is sitting by the fire.
YARA: They told me you were home and I didn’t believe it. “Theon Greyjoy?” I said. “He’s dead. He’s been dead a long time." He let you go?
THEON: I escaped.
YARA turns and looks at THEON.
YARA: I can’t hear you.
THEON: I escaped.
YARA stands up and then walks towards THEON.
YARA: Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.
THEON: I’m sorry.
YARA: You were my brother. You’re a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me.
THEON: I know. I know and I’m sorry.
YARA: Stop saying that.
THEON: He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.
YARA: I know.
THEON: You don’t know.
YARA: He send us one of those pieces. That’s why I came for you.
THEON sobs.
YARA: Why did you come here?
THEON: Where else could I go?
YARA: You heard father was dead and thought you’d claim the crown?
THEON: No, no. I only heard he died after we docked.
YARA: You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?
THEON: I didn’t know.
YARA: You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you’ve done?
THEON: I don’t want to be king.
YARA: What do you want?
THEON: I should’ve listened to you. You’re the only one --
YARA: That doesn’t matter anymore. Stop crying.  Look at me. Tell me what you want.
THEON: You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.
INT. WINTERFELL – ROOM
RAMSAY peels an apple with a knife. The door opens. A guard ushers OSHA into the room. RAMSAY nods. The guard leaves and closes the door.
RAMSAY: They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?
OSHA: A lord?
RAMSAY: Yes. A lord. You’ve seen my banners?
OSHA: The flayed man.
RAMSAY: Does that worry you at all?
OSHA: You eat them after?
RAMSAY: No.
OSHA: Then I’ve seen worse.
RAMSAY peels the skin of the apple and puts it on the table with the knife. OSHA looks at the knife.  RAMSAY waves for OSHA to come to him. She walks towards him.
RAMSAY: You served the Starks?
OSHA: Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I’ve served them.
RAMSAY: The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon.
OSHA:  He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn’t get no wages. Way I see it, I’m owed.
RAMSAY: Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He’s mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?
OSHA: I can give you what you want.
RAMSAY: Are you sure you know what that is?
OSHA comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.
OSHA: Same thing men always want. And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.
OSHA slowly begins to reach for the knife on the table.
RAMSAY: You’re a good talker.
RAMSAY grabs OSHA by her hair and yanks her head back.
RAMSAY: I like that.
RAMSAY kisses OSHA'S neck. She reaches into his pants.
RAMSAY: You’re a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.
OSHA: That so?
RAMSAY: I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.
OSHA's hand inches closer to the knife.
RAMSAY: He told me everything. All about the Stark boys. Who helped them escape, and how she did it.
OSHA gets up and tries to stab RAMSAY with the knife, but RAMSAY stabs her in the neck first. She falls on the ground, with blood running from her neck. She dies. RAMSAY cleans his knife and continues to peel the apple. He bites a piece.
EXT. CASTLE BLACK – COURTYARD
MAN: Open the gate!
The gate opens and a knight from the Bolton family enters.
CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK – MESS HALL
SANSA, JON SNOW, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and DOLOROUS EDD are eating at a table. SANSA looks at the meat on her fork. JON SNOW, DOLOROUS EDD, and TORMUND eat vigorously. BRIENNE looks around at the men eating. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks away. TORMUND smiles. DOLOROUS EDD notices their interaction.
DOLOROUS EDD (to SANSA): Sorry about the food. It’s not what we’re known for.
SANSA: That’s all right. There are more important things.
A Night's Watchman enters the room and holds out a scroll to JON SNOW.
MAN: A letter for you, Lord Commander.
JON SNOW: I’m not Lord Commander anymore.
JON SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.
JON SNOW: "To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.
JON SNOW looks at SANSA.
JON SNOW: His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --
SANSA: Go on.
JON SNOW: It's just more of the same.
JON SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading.
SANSA: "You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
JON SNOW: Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
SANSA: His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.
JON SNOW: We don’t know that.
SANSA: Yes, we do.
TORMUND: How many men does he have in his army?
SANSA: I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis’s attack.
JON SNOW (to TORMUND): How many do you have?
TORMUND: That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people.
SANSA (to JON SNOW): You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They’ll fight for you if you ask.
SANSA takes JON SNOW's hand.
SANSA: A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.
JON SNOW nods.
INT. VAES DOTHRAK – TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN
All the khals are gathered in council. They speak in Dothraki.
KHAL MORO: It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city. It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
KHAL #1: So we don’t spill blood.
KHAL MORO: Well… there’s always a little blood.
KHAL #1: Someone crushed his head with a rock.
KHAL MORO: Aggo belonged to my khalaser. He served me well. He got his head smashed in by a rock. Fuck Aggo.
KHAL #1 sits down.
KHAL MORO: Bring in Drogo’s widow.
DAENARYS enters, ushered by the Lhazareen woman and the leader of the Dosh Khaleen. The khals bow their heads.
KHAL #2: Who cares about her? She’s a midget.
KHAL #1: I like her.
KHAL #2: She’s paler than milk.
KHAL #3: I’d like to know what a khaleesi tastes like.
KHAL #1: Good. You can suck my dick.
The Khals laugh.
KHAL MORO: She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.
KHAL #4: The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They’re offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?
KHAL MORO: Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. I’ll take their horses for myself.
DAENERYS: Don’t you want to know what I think?
All the khals raise their heads and stare at DAENERYS
KHAL MORO: You’d rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you’d like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?
DAENERYS: No. I don’t want either of those things.
KHAL MORO: We don’t care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are.
DAENERYS: I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.
KHAL MORO: And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo.
DAENERYS: This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.
KHAL MORO: And you were dumb enough to believe him?
DAENERYS: And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you’ll raid, how many girls you’ll get to fuck, how many horses you’ll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will.
The khals laugh.
KHAL MORO: All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we’ll take turns fucking you. And then we’ll let our bloodriders fuck you.
KHAL MORO stands.
KHAL MORO: And If there’s anything left of you, we’ll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?
DAENERYS lays her hand on a fire pit.
DAENERYS: You’re not going to serve. You’re going to die.
DAENERYS knocks down all the fire pits one by one. The khals cower away from the flame. The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple. DAENERYS grabs the final fire pit and knocks it in KHAL MORO's direction. The fire engulfs the entire temple and kills all the khals. DAENERYS walks out of the fire, unharmed and naked. All the Dothraki bow to DAENERYS. JORAH and DAARIO walk up to the steps burning temple. JORAH bows to DAENERYS. DAARIO stares at her and then bows.
CREDITS
SANSA is knitting. There is a knock at the door.
SANSA: Yes?
A man of the Night’s Watch enters.
MAN: For you, my lady.
The man hands SANSA a scroll. It bears the mockingbird sigil of House Baelish. SANSA unrolls the scroll and reads it.
SANSA: How far is Mole’s Town?
LITTLEFINGER is standing in the center of the room. SANSA and BRIENNE enter. LITTLEFINGER turns to greet them.
LITTLEFINGER: Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.
SANSA: Unharmed? What are you doing here?
LITTLEFINGER: I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They’re encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
SANSA: To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn’t know, you’re an idiot. If you did know, you’re my enemy.
SANSA steps closer to LITTLEFINGER.
SANSA: Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark’s daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?
LITTLEFINGER: I can’t begin to contemplate --
SANSA: What do you think he did to me?
BRIENNE: Lady Sansa asked you a question.
LITTLEFINGER: He beat you.
SANSA: Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?
LITTLEFINGER: Sansa, I --
SANSA: What else?
LITTLEFINGER: Did he cut you?
SANSA: Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
LITTLEFINGER: I didn’t know.
SANSA: I thought you knew everyone’s secrets.
LITTLEFINGER: I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger.
SANSA: The other things he did, ladies aren’t supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don’t mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.
LITTLEFINGER: I’m so sorry.
SANSA: You said you would protect me.
LITTLEFINGER: And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
SANSA: I don’t believe you anymore. I don’t need you anymore. You can’t protect me. You won’t even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn’t I?
LITTLEFINGER: Do you want me to beg for my life? If that’s what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.
SANSA: What if I want you to die here and now?
LITTLEFINGER: Then I will die.
SANSA: You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.
LITTLEFINGER: I would do anything to undo what’s been done to you. I know that I can’t. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
SANSA: I have an army.
LITTLEFINGER: Your brother’s army.
LITTLEFINGER walks beside SANSA.
LITTLEFINGER: Half-brother.
LITTLEFINGER exits.
WAIF: You’re not ready. You should go home before it’s too late.
The WAIF begins to walk away. ARYA jumps to her feet. The WAIF turns around and drops her staff, then approaches ARYA. ARYA swings at the WAIF several times, but the WAIF dodges and redirects the blows. The WAIF kicks ARYA in her midsection, sending her off the platform. ARYA hops back on the platform and advances. The WAIF disarms ARYA and punches her multiple times, knocking her off the platform and onto the ground.
WAIF: You’ll never be one of us, Lady Stark.
The Faceless Man taking on the visage of JAQEN H’GHAR appears.
JAQEN: She has a point.
JAQEN walks away. ARYA follows. They enter the Hall of Faces.
JAQEN: None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.
ARYA: Who was the first?
JAQEN: He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled.
ARYA: Where did they go?
JAQEN: Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires.
ARYA: A girl has no desires.
JAQEN holds up a small bottle.
ARYA: Who?
ARYA takes the bottle.
JAQEN: An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall.
Actors are performing a play. An audience has gathered to watch. ARYA is among them. On stage, an actor named IZEMBARO dressed as ROBERT BARATHEON walks back and forth. Two prop men mirror his movements, carrying a tarp that displays a forest landscape. Another prop man carries a cut-out of a boar and rams it into the actor’s rear end. The sound man makes a farting noise.
IZEMBARO: Ahh!
ARYA laughs along with the crowd. The prop man strikes IZEMBARO with the boar prop again, this time in front. The actor recoils and the prop men replace the forest background with a black background.
IZEMBARO: Oh, murdered by a boar. The great big hairy whore. He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more.
IZEMBARO produces an intestine prop from his garb. He staggers, but is supported by another actor, CLARENZO, portraying JOFFREY.
CLARENZO: Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie. I love you, Father. Please don’t die.
IZEMBARO prop slaps CLARENZO. ARYA laughs with the crowd.
IZEMBARO: Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.
The actor portraying Joffrey falls to his knees in the front of the stage. LADY CRANE, portraying CERSEI, appears on the stage and walks to him.
LADYC RANE: I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it’s time to learn to look darkness in the face?
IZEMBARO: Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.
BOBONO, portraying TYRION, appears and fills his glass. CAMELLO, portraying NED, appears and adjusts his crotch.
CAMELLO: Ooh! Ooh, what’s happened here, then?
BOBONO: He brought you here, Ned Stark, ‘cause you’re the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand.
CAMELLO: We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.
CAMELLO gestures to IZEMBARO.
CAMELLO: I’d ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful.
The crowd laughs. ARYA looks around at them. She does not laugh.
IZEMBARO: I die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go.
The sound man makes a farting noise.
LADY CRANE: Will you stay on as Joffrey’s Hand?
CAMELLO: The Iron Throne’s what I demand.
LADY CRANE: You cannot.
CAMELLO: I can.
LADY CRANE: You will not.
CAMELLO: I will.
LADY CRANE: You dare not.
CAMELLO: I dare yes.
LADY CRANE: The line of succession.
CAMELLO: What’s that mean?
LADY CRANE: The proper progression.
CAMELLO: What’s that mean?
LADY CRANE: The lawful ascension.
CAMELLO: What’s that mean?
The crowd laughs. Music plays. The crowd claps and cheers. The actors change scenes. CLARENZO is sitting on a cut-out of the Iron Throne. LADY CRANE and CAMELLO are standing next to him. BOBONO stands off to the side on a step stool.
CAMELLO: So move along, give me my chair and there won’t be no more trouble.
CLARENZO prop slaps CAMELLO. CAMELLO stumbles into the grasp of BOBONO, who sends him to his knees.
CAMELLO: But we had a deal all done and dusted.
Two prop men carrying spears lift CAMELLO to his feet.
CAMELLO: I’m starting to think you can’t be trusted.
The prop men usher CAMELLO offstage. As they change the scene, CLARENZO and LADY CRANE take center stage. LADY CRANE dons CLARENZO with a crown. In a new scene, CAMELLO is on a cut-out chopping block. CLARENZO and LADY CRANE stand to one side, and a prop man dressed as an executioner stands on the other. BIANCA, portraying Sansa, appears.
BIANCA: Save my father.
LADY CRANE: Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.
BIANCA: Save him, please.
LADY CRANE: Show him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.
CLARENZO: Good people, you may all relax. My father’s friend shall be spared the —
The prop man portraying the executioner swings his axe. CAMELLO ducks behind the chopping block and tosses out a prop head.
BIANCA: Father! No! Oh, father.
BIANCA takes the prop head. The executioner prop man wrenches the head from her grasp and tosses it to the other prop men.
BOBONO: Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you’ll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position’s mine for life. And he’s give me permission to take Sansa as my wife.
He prop slaps CLARENZO in the face.
BOBONO: You’ll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.
He rips open her shirt, exposing her breasts.
BOBONO: So let’s forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night.
CUT TO: BACKSTAGE
All the actors from the play are gathered together, taking a break and attending to their costumes. The director, IZEMBARO, joins them. CLARENZO is examining his penis.
CLARENZO: It’s a wart. Two warts. I’ve got two fucking warts on my cock.
CAMELLO: Well, don’t worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years.
CAMELLO approaches ARYA and tosses her his costume cloak.
CAMELLO: Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.
IZEMBARO (to BIANCA): You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do.
BIANCA: I had two lines.
IZEMBARO: There are no small parts. You rang very false.
BIANCA: I rang very false?
BOBONO: What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true.
BIANCA slaps BOBONO upside the head.
BIANCA (to IZEMBARO): You weren’t complaining about me last night.
BOBONO approaches LADY CRANE.
BOBONO: May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?
LADY CRANE: I’m a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we’re going to be intimate.
BOBONO: Of course we’re going to be intimate.
LADY CRANE: It’s only a matter of time.
LADY CRANE uncorks her bottle of rum and pours herself a glass. The holds her drink up to BOBONO.
LADY CRANE: To our children.
BOBONO: May they have your talent.
LADY CRANE: And your filthy mind.
They clink their glasses together and drink.
JAQEN is washing a body. ARYA is standing by.
ARYA: A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
JAQEN looks at ARYA and nods.
ARYA: If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
JAQEN: A girl is not ready.
ARYA: She’s a good actress.
JAQEN: So a man has heard.
ARYA: Seems like a decent woman.
JAQEN: Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
ARYA: No. Who wants her dead?
JAQEN: That does not matter. The price was paid.
ARYA: The younger actress. She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better.
JAQEN: A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.
ARYA: A girl has decided.
JAQEN: A servant does not ask questions.
BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN are walking together. They approach a weirwood tree encircled by many stones. The stones form a spiral. A Child of the Forest runs between the stones. BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN follow her. They find a group of the Children crouching in a circle, whispering to each other. LEAF stands, carrying a shard of dragonglass. She approaches a man who is bound to the weirwood tree.
MAN: No! No! No!
LEAF slowly drives the shard into the man’s heart until it disappears inside his chest. The man’s eyes turn blue.
LEAF is watching BRAN. BRAN releases the root of the tree and wakes up from his vision.
BRAN: It was you. You made the White Walkers.
LEAF: We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.
BRAN: From whom?
LEAF: From you. From men.
LEAF exits. BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN stare at each other.
AERON: We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?
YARA walks out into the open.
YARA: I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne.
MAN #1: We’ve never had a queen. Not once.
YARA: There are many things we’ve never done. We’ve never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist.
ALL: Aye!
YARA: We are a sea people.
ALL: Aye!
YARA: Our god is a sea god.
ALL: Aye!
YARA: When I am queen, we will build a fleet that —
MAN #2: You shall not be queen!
YARA: I am not finished!
MAN #2: Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us. Not when Balon’s own male heir has returned.
The man looks at THEON. THEON emerges from the crowd and turns to face them.
THEON: I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
THEON points at YARA.
THEON: And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is.
ALL: Aye!
THEON: She is a reaver!
ALL: Aye!
THEON: She is a warrior!
ALL: Aye!
THEON: She is ironborn!
ALL: Aye!
THEON: We will find no better leader. This is our queen.
THEON and YARA stare at each other. The men cheer and chant YARA’s name.
EURON: I’m Euron Greyjoy.
The men fall silent. EURON appears and walks through the crowd towards YARA and THEON.
EURON: I claim the Salt Throne.
EURON emerges from the crowd and stands before YARA and THEON. He looks at YARA.
EURON: Niece.
EURON looks at THEON and then walks up to him.
EURON: Nephew. Little Theon.
EURON pats THEON on the cheek, then turns to face the crowd.
EURON: Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn’t keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
The Ironborn laugh. EURON points at YARA.
EURON: Explains why you think a woman can be king.
YARA: When did you return, Uncle?
EURON: A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
YARA: I’m glad you’re here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
The men murmur to each other.
EURON: I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren’t for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn’t win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
THEON: That would have been hard to do. You weren’t here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time.
EURON: Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
The Ironborn laugh.
EURON: Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
THEON: You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
EURON: And how will she do that?
YARA: I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
EURON: Right idea, except I’m the one who’s going to build the Iron Fleet because I’m the one who knows how to use it. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I’m going to build that fleet and I’m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock.
The Ironborn laugh.
YARA: You’re going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
EURON: I’m not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we’re going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn’t born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
The Ironborn cheer and chant EURON’s name. THEON and YARA exchange a glance.
Several Ironborn carrying flags stand on the shore. EURON is kneeling in the water. AERON pushes him underwater. Meanwhile, YARA, THEON, and some Ironborn run through a cave tunnel.
AERON: May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.
THEON, YARA, and the men with them run out onto a beach and into awaiting rowboats.
AERSON: Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
EURON drowns.
AERON: Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
YARA, THEON, and the men board a large ship.
AERON: What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.
AERON releases his grip on EURON. Two Ironborn carrying EURON onto shore. AERON and the other Ironborn gathered in attendance all stare at EURON. EURON does not move.One man begins to walk closer to him. EURON gags and coughs. He props himself up on his arms and legs, then spits up water and gasps for air. AERON retrieves a crown made of driftwood and places it on EURON’s head.
AERON: What is dead may never die.
ALL: What is dead may never die.
The Ironborn cheer. EURON rises to his feet and looks around at the crowd.
EURON: Where are my niece and nephew? Let’s go murder them.
EURON leads AERON and the Ironborn up to a seaside cliff. They stare out at the ocean. A fleet of ships is sailing away from Pyke.
AERON: They stole our best ships.
EURON: Won’t be enough to save them.
EURON turns to face the Ironborn.
EURON: Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
DAENERYS (to JORAH): I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can’t take you back and I can’t send you away.
DAENERYS approaches JORAH, but he recoils.
JORAH: You must send me away.
JORAH rolls up his sleeve to reveal the greyscale covering his forearm.
DAENERYS: Is there a cure?
JORAH: I don’t know.
DAENERYS: How long does it take?
JORAH: I don’t know that either. But I’ve seen what happens when it goes far enough. I’ll end things before that.
DAENERYS begins to cry.
DAENERYS: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
JORAH: Don’t be. All I’ve ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I’ll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi.
JORAH begins to walk away.
DAENERYS: Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal.
JORAH turns back to face DAENERYS. She approaches him.
DAENERYS: You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
JORAH nods.
DAENERYS: Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side.
JORAH sits on a horse, watching DAENERYS and DAARIO lead the Dothraki horde out of Vaes Dothrak. He turns his horse around and starts off into the wilderness.
VARYS: In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?
GREY WORM: None.
VARYS: And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
GREY WORM: Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing.
VARYS: So it’s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
GREY WORM: For now.
VARYS: For now is the best we get in our profession.
TYRION: It’s not enough.
VARYS: Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I’d say it’s a good start.
TYRION: It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that.
MISSANDEI: The people know who brought them freedom.
TYRION: Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced.
VARYS: Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
TYRION: Who said anything about “him”?
TYRION and VARYS stand on the plateau above the audience chamber. A woman stans  at the bottom of the steps, and a man stand a few steps in front of her.
MAN (speaking Valyrian): You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light.
The man steps aside. KINVARA walks up a few steps.
TYRION (speaking Valyrian): Welcome to Meereen.
KINVARA stops on the middle plateau.
TYRION: That’s about the extent of my Valyrian.
KINVARA says nothing.
TYRION: Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
TYRION looks at VARYS. KINVARA says nothing.
TYRION: The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
KINVARA: You don’t need to persuade me. I came to help.
KINVARA continues up the steps.
KINVARA: Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
TYRION: Yes.
KINVARA: She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
TYRION: She did indeed.
KINVARA: Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven’t you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away.
TYRION: Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
KINVARA: You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she’s gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.
TYRION: I’d settle for obeyed.
KINVARA: I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
TYRION: That sounds most excellent --
VARYS: A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King’s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he’d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good.
TYRION: We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
VARYS: I suppose it’s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn’t that the whole point of being a fanatic? You’re always right. Everything is the Lord’s will.
KINVARA: Everything is the Lord’s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
VARYS: And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?
TYRION: My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.
VARYS nods. KINVARA takes two more steps. She is one step away from TYRION and VARYS.
KINVARA: Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn’t be here helping the Lord’s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there’s still so much you don’t know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?
KINVARA approaches VARYS and places her hand on his arm.
KINVARA: Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
VARYS scrunches up his face and stares at KINVARA. KINVARA smiles.
KINVARA: We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me.
KINVARA turns and walks back down the steps.
BRAN walks among the spiraling stones surrounding the weirwood tree from before, only now everything is covered in snow. He stares at the tree, then turns around. The army of the undead stands in attendance.
BRAN: What?
BRAN walks towards them, and then among their ranks. They do not react. He inspects several of them as he walks by. On the other side of the army, he finds the Night King and four White Walkers on horseback. The Night King stares at him. BRAN turns around to find the entire army of the undead staring at him. When he turns back around, the Night King is standing right behind him. He recoils, but the Night King grabs his forearm. He screams.
BRAN screams as he releases the tree root and the vision ends. MEERA jumps to her feet.
BRAN: He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!
THREE-EYED RAVEN: He touched you.
LEAF and another Child of the Forest enter.
BRAN: I don’t know. He was close, but --
THREE-EYED RAVEN: He touched you.
BRAN pulls back his sleeve. There is a handprint on his forearm.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: He knows you are here. He’ll come for you.
BRAN: But he can’t get in.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you.
MEERA: Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.
HODOR: Hodor.
BRAN: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: The time has come.
BRAN: The time for what?
THREE-EYED RAVEN: For you to become me.
BRAN: But am I ready?
THREE-EYED RAVEN: No.
BRAN’s eyes turn white.
JON SNOW: We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.
DAVOS: Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys.
DAVOS stands and moves some of the tokens to Winterfell.
DAVOS: The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we’re not doing so well there.
SANSA: The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
DAVOS: I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don’t think we can count on them either.
SANSA: How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?
DAVOS: Precious little, my lady.
SANSA: My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.
DAVOS: They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They’re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don’t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon’s going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it’s a fight they can win.
SANSA: The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay’s own door.
DAVOS: I don’t doubt it. But Jon doesn’t have the Stark name.
SANSA: No, but I do.
JON SNOW stares at SANSA.
SANSA: Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark’s son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton’s. Ant there are also the Tullys. They’re not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question.
DAVOS: I didn’t know the Tullys still had an army.
SANSA: My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
JON SNOW: How do you know that?
SANSA: Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
DAVOS: That’s good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side.
SANSA smiles.
BRIENNE follows SANSA down the stairs and along a walkway.
BRIENNE: I’ve sworn to protect you, my lady.
SANSA: You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
BRIENNE: We can send the Blackfish a raven.
SANSA: Can’t risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
BRIENNE and SANSA enter SANSA’s chamber. BRIENNE closes the door behind them.
SANSA: Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you’ll know how to talk to him.
SANSA sits down on her bed.
SANSA: What is it?
BRIENNE: I don’t like leaving you here alone.
SANSA: With Jon?
BRIENNE: Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that’s understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --
SANSA: Jon isn’t Tormund. Jon isn’t Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He’s my brother. He’ll keep me safe. I trust him.
BRIENNE: Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
Several men of the Night’s Watch are readying horses. JON SNOW stands beside them. MELISANDRE sits on her horse behind them. BRIENNE walks past. SANSA approaches JON SNOW, carrying a bundled cloak.
JON SNOW: New dress?
SANSA: I made it myself. Do you like it?
SANSA: Good, because I made this for you.
SANSA hands JON SNOW the cloak. JON SNOW looks at it. The direwolf sigil of House Stark is pressed into the leather straps.
SANSA: I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
JON SNOW: Thank you, Sansa.
SANSA: You’re welcome.
SANSA walks away. BRIENNE is sitting on horseback beside TORMUND. TORMUND stares at her. She catches him staring and looks away. He grins. DOLOROUS EDD approaches JON SNOW, who is donning his new cloak.
JON SNOW: Don’t knock it down while I’m gone.
DOLOROUS EDD: I’ll do my best.
They embrace.
DOLOROUS EDD: Good luck.
JON SNOW walks to his horse and climbs atop it. He leads SANSA, MELISANDRE, PODRICK, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and the rest of the party out through the southern gates. A man of the Night’s Watch approaches DOLOROUS EDD, who is watching them leave.
MAN: Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?
DOLOROUS EDD: I’m not the Lord Comman --
The men of the Night’s Watch gather around DOLOROUS EDD.
DOLOROUS EDD: Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.
MEERA: We can go home now, Hodor. Well, maybe not home home, but somewhere that isn’t a cave.
HODOR chuckles.
HODOR: Hodor.
MEERA: Eat something that isn’t moss. I want an egg. How do you like ‘em? Boiled? Fried up with some butter?
HODOR laughs.
HODOR: Hodor.
MEERA: With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.
HODOR: Hodor.
MEERA notices she can see her breath. She looks at BRAN and then runs to the entrance of the cave. LEAF and the other Children of the Forest are gathered outside. Across the field, the Night King, three White Walkers, and the army of the dead are gathered. The Night King steps forward, kneels, and places his hand on the ground. A rift cracks through the ice all across the field and into the Great Weirwood Tree.
LEAF: Get Bran and run!
MEERA runs back into the cave, retrieving a sword on the way back. The Night King unsheathes his blade and leads the White Walkers and the army of the dead towards the Great Weirwood. Inside, MEERA runs to BRAN and shakes him.
MEERA: Bran. Bran, wake up. Bran.
HODOR sits in the corner, rocking back and forth.
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
MEERA: Bran, wake up.
BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN watch YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN embrace. BRAN smiles.
MEERA hauls the sledge over to BRAN and tries to drag him onto it.
MEERA: Hodor.
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
MEERA: Help me!
Outside, LEAF and the Children of the Forest throw magic spheres at the army of the undead. The spheres explode upon contact, killing some of the wights. With one of the last bombs, LEAF lights a half-circle of flame in front of the entrance to the cave. She and the Children of the Forest run inside. The Night King and the White Walkers approach the flame. The flame parts to let them pass, then reforms. The army of the dead cannot pass through the flame. They go around it and climb the crag to the top of the Great Weirwood. Inside, MEERA places BRAN on the sledge.
BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN continue to watch.
RICKARD (to YOUNG NED): Remember that you are a Stark. Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale and try to stay out of fights.
NAN walks over to YOUNG HODOR and takes his arm.
YOUNG NED: Yes, Father.
RICKARD takes YOUNG NED by the chin.
RICKARD: But if you have to fight, win.
MEERA continues shaking BRAN.
MEERA: Bran! Bran, wake up!
A wight falls through the ceiling. It advances on MEERA. MEERA grabs her sword and cuts it down. Another wight falls from the ceiling. MEERA recoils. SUMMER tackles it. MEERA drops her blade and returns to BRAN.
MEERA: Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up.
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
LEAF enters and runs up to BRAN and MEERA. A third wight falls from the ceiling, suspended upside down by its feet. LEAF rushes over to it and beheads it with her knife.
MEERA: You have to wake up. We need Hodor.
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
Another wight rushes, but LEAF shoots it with an arrow. A Child of the Forest enters to combat another wight, but the wight knocks her down and kills her. LEAF shoots it with an arrow.
HODOR: Hodor.
A number of wights begin piling in. LEAF and the Children of the Forest try to fight them off. One wight kills another Child of the Forest.
MEERA: Bran, we’re all going to die!
BRAN hears MEERA shouting at him from the other side.
MEERA (V.O.): Bran, wake up! We’re all going to die! Bran! Bran!
MEERA: Bran, you have to wake up! We need Hodor!
HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
MEERA: Warg into Hodor now!
BRAN looks at YOUNG HODOR and NAN.
MEERA (V.O.): Bran, wake up. We need Hodor. We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now! Now!
THREE-EYED RAVEN: Listen to your friend, Brandon.
HODOR (V.O.): Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
HODOR’s eyes flash white. More wights enter the cave. One of them kills another Child of the Forest. MEERA cuts it down. Another Child of the Forest  jumps forward and stabs another wight with a spear. HODOR stands and walks over to BRAN.  A White Walker enters. The spear-bearing Child of the Forest lunges at it and stabs it in the chest, but the blow has no effect. The White Walker pushes the spear aside and stabs the Child of the Forest, killing her. HODOR lifts the sledge with BRAN atop it. MEERA grabs a dragonglass spear and launches it into the White Walker’s neck. The White Walker shatters and dies. MEERA and LEAF follow HODOR towards the back entrance. SUMMER growls and bares his teeth at the wights entering the cave.
MEERA: Summer!
LEAF: Go. Go!
LEAF and MEERA run into the back tunnel. SUMMER attacks the wights. The wights encircle him and stab him to death. LEAF, MEERA, and HODOR hurry down the back tunnel. BRAN is still engaged in a vision on the sledge. A slew of wights pursues them. Back in the cave, the Night King enters and approaches the THREE-EYED RAVEN.
THREE-EYED RAVEN: The time has come. Leave me.
Back in the Great Weirwood tree, the Night King slashes the THREE-EYED RAVEN. The THREE-EYED RAVEN dissolves into a black mist in front of BRAN.
The undead army is advancing. LEAF stops running.
MEERA: What are you doing?
LEAF: Go!
LEAF turns to face the undead. She brandishes a magic bomb and primes it. The wights overtake her and knock her to the ground, stabbing her repeatedly. LEAF detonates the bomb, killing herself and the wights surrounding her. HODOR reaches the rear door. He puts down the sledge and begins ramming the door. More wights appear and begin advancing.
MEERA: Hodor, hurry!
HODOR heaves the door open and drags the sledge outside. He drops the sledge and returns to the door, holding it closed. MEERA lifts the sledge and begins dragging it away.
MEERA: Hold the door!
BRAN turns and stares at YOUNG HODOR, who stares back at him.
MEERA (V.O.): Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!
YOUNG HODOR’s eyes turn white. He falls to the ground and convulses.
HODOR puts his weight against the door.
MEERA: Hold the door!
YOUNG HODOR continues convulsing.
MEERA (V.O.): Hold the door!
NAN: Wylis! What’s the matter?
NAN kneels down beside YOUNG HODOR. BRAN walks over to them.
MEERA (V.O.): Hold the door!
YOUNG HODOR: Hold the door!
In the present day, HODOR struggles against the door.
YOUNG HODOR: Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!
The wights begin to break through the door. They clutch HODOR’s clothing and begin tearing at his flesh.
YOUNG HODOR: Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold door! Hold door! Hold door! Hold door! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor!
TITLE SEQUENCEEXT. BEYOND THE WALLHeavy snow is falling. MEERA is dragging BRAN’s sledge through the forest. BRAN’s eyes are glazed white. He experiences many visions of the past all at once. MEERA staggers and falls against the base of a tree. She puts all her weight into pulling the sledge, but it does not budge. She begins crying and goes to BRAN, cradling his head. BRAN continues to have rapid fire visions, then sees a group of wights running through the woods. He wakes up from the visions and looks at MEERA.
BRAN: Meera. They found us.
MEERA looks out into the woods and sees the group of wights. She begins crying and embraces BRAN.
MEERA: I’m so sorry.
The wights converge on MEERA and BRAN. Moments before they reach them, a cloaked rider appears. The rider’s horse kicks one of the wights out of the way, then the rider extends a chain which lights on fire at the end. Two wights charge, and the rider hits them both with the chain, setting them on fire. A third wight tries to attack his horse, but the horse’s bulk rebuffs it into a tree and it crumbles. The rider plunges a chain-sickle into the chest of another wight, then rides forward, dragging the wight behind his horse. He sets another wight on fire with the chain, launching it into the air, and then approaches BRAN and MEERA.
RIDER: Come with me, now.
A large group of wights approaches.
RIDER: The dead don’t rest.
The rider leans down and hoists BRAN up onto his horse. MEERA takes the rider’s hand and joins them on the horse’s back. The three of them ride off into the forest with wights in pursuit.
EXT. ROAD TO HORN HILLSAM, GILLY, and LITTLE SAMare riding in a carriage escorted by several soldiers. GILLY looks out the window. SAM is holding LITTLE SAM.
GILLY: It’s so green.
SAM: Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer’s over, you’ll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you’ll find more green here than anywhere else.
GILLY: You’re nervous. You’re a nervous talker.
SAM looks away.
GILLY: That’s not any better being a nervous mute.
SAM: I didn’t think I’d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn’t. A person just doesn’t feel welcome at that point.
GILLY looks at LITTLE SAM.
SAM: And I certainly didn’t expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
GILLY: That Little Sam is your baby.
SAM: Yes, now that’s very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he’ll take you in. He’ll get an education. He’ll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?
GILLY: What did you tell your family about me?
SAM: I told them I met you in the North.
GILLY: Did you tell them how far north?
SAM: Well, it wasn’t a very large piece of parchment.
GILLY: You didn’t tell them where I’m really from? You didn’t tell them I’m a wildling?
SAM: The thing is...my father doesn’t like wildlings. He hoped I’d make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it’s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.
GILLY looks out the window.
GILLY: I think we’re here.
SAM looks out the window. The carriage is approaching the castle on Horn Hill.
A party of guests is lined up at the entrance to the castle courtyard. GILLY and SAM enter. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM. SAM’s mother, MELESS, and his sister, TALLA, descend a set of stairs and approach them.
MELESSA: Sam. Oh, Sam.
SAM and MELESSA embrace.
SAM: Oh, hello, Mother.
MELESSA: I never thought I’d see you again. You look wonderful.
SAM: Oh.
TALLA embraces SAM and he grunts.
SAM: Talla? Gods, you’re a woman now.
MELESSA: That’s enough, Talla.
SAM: Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.
GILLY bows her head and curtsies.
MELESSA: Oh, my. You are lovely.
GILLY: I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.
SAM: Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell.
MELESSA and TALLA smile at each other. MELESSA approaches the baby and smiles.
MELESSA: Hello, little one. It’s me, your grandmother.
LITTLE SAM smiles and touches MELESSA’s face.
MELESSA: May I hold him?
GILLY: Yes, of course.
GILLY passes LITTLE SAM to MELESSA.
MELESSA (to LITTLE SAM): You have a curious mind, I can tell. You’ll be a scholar like your father.
SAM: Where is Father? And Dickon?
MELESSA: They’re on a hunt. They’ll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.
MELESSA passes LITTLE SAM back to GILLY. SAM and MELESSA proceed up the steps. TALLA takes GILLY’s arm and they follow.
TALLA: Come, you’ll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What’s your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.
INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELORTOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are standing in the central chamber. TOMMEN lights a candle.
TOMMEN: Is there no other way?
HIGH SPARROW: You’re afraid for her?
TOMMEN: Of course I’m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
HIGH SPARROW: She’ll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn’t your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She’s truly opened her heart to them.
TOMMEN: She’s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
HIGH SPARROW: And now she’s devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
MARGAERY is sitting on a bench reading a book. The door opens. TOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are visible outside. TOMMEN enters and stares at MARGAERY. The HIGH SPARROW closes the door behind TOMMEN. MARGAERY sets down her book and stands. They embrace.
TOMMEN: Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
MARGAERY: No, Your Grace.
TOMMEN: I’ve missed you. More than you could know.
MARGAERY: We’ll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
MARGAERY: Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?
TOMMEN: Yes, a few times. Have you?
MARGAERY: Yes, I have. He’s not quite what we thought he was, is he?
TOMMEN scrunches up his face. MARGAERY chuckles and turns away.
MARGAERY: You think I’m mad. I sound mad.
MARGAERY: He is. There’s something about him. His way of looking at the world. It’s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It’s taken me a while. He’s helped me.
TOMMEN: What are you talking about? You’re a good person. You’ve always been a good person. You’re the best person I know.
MARGAERY chuckles and retrieves her book from the bench.
TOMMEN: I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
MARGAERY: Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I’ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories.
TOMMEN: I don’t understand.
MARGAERY rushes to TOMMEN and takes his hand.
MARGAERY: It’s all right. It really is. It’s such a relief to let go of those lies.
MARGAERY leads him to the bench and they sit down on it together.
TOMMEN: What about Loras?
MARGAERY: I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don’t erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.
GILLY: It’s hard to walk in this.
SAM: It’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.
GILLY takes SAM’s arm and they walk down the hall together.
SAM, GILLY, MELESSA, TALLA, DICKON, and RANDYLL are sitting around the dinner table eating. RANDYLL takes a bite and stares at SAM. GILLY looks around at others using their utensils and mimics them. SAM looks at DICKON.
SAM: This venison, it’s very tasty. Is it from today’s hunt?
DICKON: Well, no. We haven’t been able to cure that one yet. This is last week’s.
SAM: Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey.
DICKON: Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
SAM: Oh, that’s a fair distance.
DICKON: So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
SAM: Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don’t hunt, you don’t eat.
DICKON: Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
MELESSA (to GILLY): I imagine it’s common where you’re from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn’t it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.
TALLA: Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
RANDYLL: That’s enough of that.
MELESSA: Samwell, would you care for more bread?
SAM: Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother.
A servant girl retrieves the basket of bread. She holds out the basket to SAM. SAM reaches for the bread.
RANDYLL: Not fat enough already?
SAM waves the servant away.
RANDYLL: I read your letter. You’re to be a maester.
SAM: Yes. And once I have my chain, I’ll return to Castle Black.
RANDYLL: I thought the Night’s Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.
SAM puts down his utensils.
RANDYLL: Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I’ll wager you still can’t sit a horse or wield a sword.
MELESSA: Randyll, to be maester of the Night’s Watch is a great honor.
GILLY: He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.
DICKON laughs.
DICKON: There’s no such thing.
GILLY: I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker’s heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He’s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
RANDYLL: Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How’d you come to meet my son?
GILLY: The Night’s Watch came to our keep.
RANDYLL: Where?
SAM: Gilly.
GILLY: North of the Wall.
RANDYLL: North of the Wall? You’re a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?
RANDYLL points to a blade mounted on a mantle beside the table.
RANDYLL: It’s called Heartsbane. It’s been in our family for 500 years. It’s Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It’s supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole’s Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn’t you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home.
MELESSA throws down her utensils and stands. She walks to GILLY.
MELESSA: Come, my dear. Talla.
TALLA and GILLY stand and begin to follow MELESSA out of the hall.
MELESSA: I’ve lost my appetite.
RANDYLL: He dishonors us.
MELESSA: You dishonor yourself.
RANDYLL (to SAM): Your mother’s a fine woman. You’re not worthy of her. To please her, I’ll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.
GILLY is sitting at the foot of the bed. LITTLE SAM is in a crib beside her. SAM stands before them both. He hangs his head.
SAM: I’m sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he’d turn you and Little Sam away.
GILLY: I’m not angry at you. I’m angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?
SAM: First light.
LITTLE SAM fusses and reaches for SAM. SAM takes his hand.
SAM: Say good-bye to him for me.
SAM starts off but GILLY stands and gets in his way. She places her hands on his chest and kisses him.
GILLY: You’re not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn’t know what you are.
SAM: Good-bye, Gilly.
SAM walks to the door. He turns back and stares at GILLY before closing the doors. GILLY looks around the guest chamber and then goes to LITTLE SAM. She pulls his blanket up higher and comforts him. SAM bursts back into the room.
GILLY: Sam?
SAM: We’re leaving.
GILLY: What?
SAM: Get your things.
GILLY: I don’t have any things.
SAM picks up LITTLE SAM.
GILLY: What are you doing?
SAM: We belong together. All of us.
SAM and GILLY walk briskly through the hall. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM.
GILLY: What about your mother and sister?
SAM: Oh, they’ll understand.
GILLY: Your sister’s dress.
SAM grabs a stool and carries it in front of the mantle hosting Heartsbane.
SAM: She won’t mind. Looks better on you anyway.
SAM climbs on top of the stool.
GILLY: Sam. That’s your father’s sword.
SAM lifts Heartsbane off the mantle. He groans and slides it into its scabbard.
SAM: It’s my family’s sword.
GILLY: Sam. Won’t he come for it?
SAM: He can bloody well try.
SAM hops down off the stool.
CLARENZO: The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.
The actress portraying MARGAERY runs to CLARENZO.
CLARENZO: And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love.
ALL: Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.
CLARENZO: I’ll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?
BOBONO approaches CLARENZO and hands him a prop cup.
BOBONO: Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine.
CLARNEZO takes the prop cup and BOBONO walks to center stage, addressing the audience.
BOBONO: The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.
BOBONO laughs and the audience boos. CLARENZO takes a sip from the prop cup, then gags and sputters. The audience gasps. He moves to center stage.
ARYA smiles and laughs in the crowd.
CLARENZO: I limp. And it was he…
CLARENZO points at BOBONO. BOBONO holds up a prop vial of poison. The audience gasps and boos.
CLARENZO: ...that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.
BOBONO laughs and exits with BIANCA. The audience boos. CLARENZO collapses and LADY CRANE kneels down beside him. ARYA laughs. LADY CRANE cradles the head of the actor portraying JOFFREY.
LADY CRANE: My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain.
ARYA’s smile fades.
LADY CRANE: Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief.
ARYA notices BIANCA standing offstage. BIANCA is watching LADY CRANE’s performance and mouths her lines as she utters them.
LADY CRANE: Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow.
LADY CRANE kisses CLARENZO’s cheek and lays his head down. The audience claps. The actors clear out the stage and the prop men change the scene. BOBONO enters carrying a prop crossbow. IZEMBARO, portraying TYWIN, is sitting on a prop toilet.
BOBONO: What is that I hear and smell? Someone I’ll soon send to hell.
ARYA leaves the front row and moves through the crowd.
BOBONO: It’s time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
BOBONO pretends to shoot IZEMBARO with the crossbow. IZEMBARO cries out.
IZEMBARO: You beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you’ve taken your father’s life.
CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE
ARYA enters and walks further inward. On her way through the entrance hall, she sees the prop head the performers use for NED’s execution scene.
IZEMBARO (O.S.): No worse child ever stained this land.
CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE
IZEMBARO: Curse the day I named you.
IZEMBARO groans as though dying and turns to the side. The sound guy makes a farting noise.
BOBONO: My greatest crime. Now I must flee.
CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE
ARYA walks into the actor’s break room.
BOBONO (O.S.): Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.
ARYA draws the curtain and stares at LADY CRANE’s bottle of rum.
BOBONO (O.S.): Don’t fear the winter.
CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE
BOBONO: Fear me!
BOBONO shoots a prop arrow into the audience and laughs. The audience gasps and boos him offstage.
CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE
IZEMBARO (O.S.): Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo.
ARYA retrieves a vial of from her satchel. She uncorks LADY CRANE’s bottle of rum.
CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE STAGE
IZEMBARO, BIANCA, and CLARENZO stand center stage.
IZEMBARO: I give you Bobono.
BOBONO enters the stage and the audience boos.
IZEMBARO: I give you Camello.
CUT TO: SHEELBA SQUARE BACKSTAGE
ARYA pours the contents of the vial into LADY CRANE’s rum bottle and corks it.
IZEMBARO (O.S.): And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane.
On stage, LADY CRANE enters and bows. The crowd cheers wildly. AYRA hears the cheering. She tucks the away the vial, draws back the curtain, and exits the break room. The actors are all piling into the area. CAMELLO approaches ARYA in the entrance hallway and hands her his costume cloak.
CAMELLO: Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That’s a dear.
IZEMBARO and BIANCA enter.
IZEMBARO (to BIANCA): That crowd was shit.
ARYA walks past them and puts down the cloak. She moves to leave. LADY CRANE enters and sees her.
LADY CRANE: Girl.
ARYA stops on the steps and looks at LADY CRANE.
LADY CRANE: What are you doing back here?
ARYA: Nothing.
LADY CRANE: I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?
ARYA: Three times.
LADY CRANE: Did you pay?
ARYA smiles.
ARYA: No.
ARYA walks off the steps to get out of the way of the prop men.
LADY CRANE: I remember when the players came to my village. I didn’t have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other’s arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.
ARYA: You’re very good.
LADY CRANE: My final speech is shit.
LADY CRANE takes ARYA by the waist and ushers her towards the break room.
LADY CRANE: But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing’s no good.
They stop in a side corridor.
ARYA: So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.
LADY CRANE: How would you change it?
ARYA: The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn’t just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
LADY CRANE: What’s your name?
ARYA: Mercy.
LADY CRANE: You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.
ARYA smiles.
LADY CRANE: Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?
ARYA: I have to go. My father’s waiting for me.
ARYA exits. LADY CRANE enter the break room. BIANCA takes off her wig and notices LADY CRANE.
BIANCA: Lady Crane, they loved you.
LADY CRANE removes her wig.
LADY CRANE: They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.
IZEMBARO: No laugh for Ned’s death. These people are worse than animals.
IZEMBARO sips from a mug and gestures to LADY CRANE.
IZEMBARO: But they loved her. They all love her.
CAMELLO removes his wig and approaches LADY CRANE.
CAMELLO: Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.
LADY CRANE: I do what I can with what I’m given.
IZEMBARO: With what you’re given?
IZEMBARO: Oh, we’re all thinkers now, are we?
IZEMBARO stands, slaps his chest, and walks closer to LADY CRANE.
IZEMBARO: Full to the tits with ideas.
IZEMBARO: You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I’ve been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I’m doing.
IZEMBARO removes his wig.
IZEMBARO: You have no right to an opinion.
LADY CRANE brings a glass of rum to her lips. Just before she drinks, ARYA appears and slaps the glass out of her hands. Everyone in the room stares at ARYA. ARYA points at BIANCA.
ARYA: Careful of that one. She wants you dead.
ARYA exits. The WAIF is revealed to have been watching.
ARYA pulls the stones away from where she hid Needle. She pulls Needle from inside the rocks and stares at it.
JAQEN is cutting the face of a corpse. The WAIF enters.
JAQEN: And?
WAIF: As I expected.
JAQEN: A shame. A girl had many gifts.
JAQEN begins lifting the face off of the corpse.
WAIF: You promised me.
JAQEN: Don’t let her suffer.
The WAIF nods and exits. JAQEN pulls the face from the corpse.
CUT TO: UNKNOWN ALLEY
ARYA sets down a lit candle and brandishes Needle. She places Needle on the ground, sits down beside it, and blows out the candle.
EXT. KING’S LANDINGJAIME is wearing armor and sitting atop a horse. He watches as MACE TYRELL, also wearing armor, leads a force of many soldiers down the street. MACE stops in front of JAIME and the soldiers halt.
MACE: My lord.
JAIME: My lord.
MACE turns his horse to face the soldiers.
MACE: My friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day!
MACE turns his horse back the other way and nods at JAIME. JAIME nods back.
CAPTAIN: Forward, march!
The HIGH SPARROW is standing on the steps beside MARGAERY and SEPTA UNELLA.. They are surrounded by Faith Militant, including LANCEL. The HIGH SPARROW is addressing a large gathering of commoners who stand at the foot of the steps.
HIGH SPARROW: Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother’s sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself.
The crowd murmurs and parts. JAIME and MACE enter, leading the soldiers. MARGAERY gasps to herself. On the side, a smaller group of soldiers sets down a carriage. OLENNA steps out of the carriage.
CAPTAIN: Company, halt! Face front! Turn!
The soldiers form up and turn to face the steps.
HIGH SPARROW: Lord Tyrell.
MACE nods at the HIGH SPARROW.
HIGH SPARROW: Ser Jaime.
JAIME: Sorry to interrupt. We’re here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we’ll be on our way.
HIGH SPARROW: I don’t have the authority to give them to you. And you don’t have the authority to take them.
The crowd murmurs. JAIME ushers his horse forward and rides it up the steps. He halts in front of the Faith Militant.
CAPTAIN: Lock spears!
The soldiers grunt and point their spears towards the Faith Militant.
JAIME: I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.
HIGH SPARROW: The gods don’t recognize his authority in this matter.
JAIME: You already insulted one great house. It won’t happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
HIGH SPARROW: To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.
The crowd murmurs. OLENNA motions to MACE with her fan. MACE motions to one of the high ranking soldiers, who nods to the Captain.
CAPTAIN: Order up!
The soldiers return to a relaxed position.
HIGH SPARROW: Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.
The doors to the Great Sept of Baelor open. TOMMEN emerges, accompanied by the Kingsguard. The crowd murmurs. JAIME looks back at OLENNA, who looks down. TOMMEN and the Kingsguard walk down the steps until TOMMEN stands beside MARGAERY. TOMMEN takes MARGAERY’s hand.
HIGH SPARROW: Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.
The crowd cheers.
WOMAN: Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!
TOMMEN looks at JAIME. JAIME shakes his head. TOMMEN looks at the crowd.
TOMMEN: The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
The crowd cheers.
MACE (to OLENNA): What’s happening?
OLENNA: He’s beaten us. That’s what’s happening.
The HIGH SPARROW smiles at JAIME.
The room is lined with soldiers on either side. TOMMEN is sitting on the throne. KEVAN stands beside him. JAIME stands at the foot of the throne and removes his armor, letting it drop to the floor.
TOMMEN: When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
JAIME: I’ve been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to do anything.
TOMMEN: I have to answer to the gods.
JAIME: Not when you’re sitting in that chair.
TOMMEN: The Crown’s decision on this matter is final.
JAIME: Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods’ mercy?
TOMMEN and KEVAN look at each other.
TOMMEN: You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.
WALDER: You’ve lost it?
BLACK WALDER: Yes, father.
WALDER: It’s a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn’t lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you.
LOTHAR: He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
WALDER: You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn’t find him. That’s what it means to lose something. Now he’s come back and taken Riverrun.
WALDER: For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back.
BLACK WALDER: We don’t have the men.
WALDER: We’ve got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
BLACK WALDER: The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.
LOTHAR: The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps.
BLACK WALDER: Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.
WALDER slaps his daughter on on the buttocks.
WALDER: If I want excuses, I’ll put her in charge. They’re laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King’s Landing, they’re laughing at us.
WALDER stands. Many family members stare at him.
WALDER: I hear it in my sleep! I’m not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I’ll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back.
LOTHAR: He’ll never yield, Father.
WALDER: Oh, he’ll yield.
WALDER nods at some servants at the rear of the hall. LOTHAR looks back at the servants. The servants exit. WALDER points first at LOTHAR and then at BLACK WALDER.
WALDER: You’ll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark’s child in his whore mother’s belly, and you’ll show him the knife you used to open his niece’s throat. And you’ll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew.
WALDER pulls his daughter into his lap. The servants return, ushering in a man bound in chains. They undo his chains. The man is EDMURE TULLY. EDMURE stares at WALDER.
WALDER: Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You’re going home.
JAIME: I’m being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can’t manage it on his own because he’s 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
JAIME stands and paces.
CERSEI: BEtter you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
JAIME: I’m not going to the Riverlands.
JAIME pours himself a cup of wine.
CERSEI: What, then?
JAIME: I’m going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone’s ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I’ll take them to the sept and I’ll remove the High Sparrow’s head and every other sparrow head I can find.
CERSEI: You can’t.
JAIME: He has our son! He stole our son! He’s torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
CERSEI: We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can.
JAIME: You’ll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
CERSEI: It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They’ve made us both stronger, all of them.
CERSEI stands and approaches JAIME.
CERSEI: They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we’re going to do to them.
JAIME and CERSEI embrace and kiss. CERSEI whispers into JAIME’s ear.
CERSEI: We’ve always been together. We’ll always be together. We’re the only two people in the world.
They resume kissing.
EXT. BEYOND THE WALLMEERA, BRAN, and the rider are gathered around a campfire. The rider beheads a rabbit and begins draining its blood. MEERA watches him.
MEERA: Why did you help us?
The rider looks at MEERA from behind his face mask.
RIDER: The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
MEERA: The Three-Eyed Raven’s dead.
RIDER: Now he lives again.
BRAN startles as he comes out of a vision. MEERA goes to him.
RIDER (to BRAN): When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.
BRAN: Who are you?
The rider removes his hood and face mask. He is BENJEN STARK. His skin is gray and he has blemishes on his face.
BRAN: Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
BENJEN: I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker’s magic from taking hold.
BRAN: How?
BENJEN: The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
BRAN: Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
BENJEN: You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
BRAN: I didn’t have time to learn. I can’t control anything.
BENJEN stands and walks over to BRAN and MEERA.
BENJEN: You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.
BENJEN kneels beside BRAN and offers him a cup.
BENJEN: Drink.
BRAN takes the cup and drinks.
BENJEN: One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready.
EXT. ESSOS ARID LANDSDAENERYS and DAARIO are leading the Dothraki horde on horseback. DAARIO shouts in Dothraki and raises his hand, halting the horde. DAENERYS stares at the face of a mountain crag in the distance.
DAARIO: Everything all right?
DAENERYS: How many days’ ride to Meereen?
DAARIO: A week at best.
DAENERYS: How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
DAENERYS: And who has that many?
DAARIO: Nobody.
DAENERYS: Nobody yet.
DAARIO: So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
DAENERYS: I take what is mine.
DAARIO: You weren’t made to sit on a chair in a palance.
DAENERYS: What was I made for?
DAARIO: You’re a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.
The wind howls. DAENERYS stares beyond the mountain crag
DAENERYS: Wait here.
DAENERYS rides away from the horde and around the bend. Time passes. The Dothraki are growing antsy.
DAARIO (speaking Dothraki): I’m going after her. Wait for me here.
DAARIO starts off, but stops when a dragon’s roar erupts from the sky. The Dothraki look around. The shadow of a dragon appears on the mountainside. DROGON flies over the Dothraki horde with DAENERYS on its back. DROGON circles around and lands in front of the horde. He roars.
DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki):  Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.
The Dothraki cheer.
DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
The Dothraki cheer.
DAENERYS: Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
The Dothraki cheer.
DAENERYS: Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?
The Dothraki cheer.
DAENERYS: Are you with me?
The Dothraki continue to cheer.
DAENERYS: Now and always?
DROGON spreads his wings and roars.
CREDITS
MAN: That’s it. Get it to the top.
MAN #2: Steady. Steady.
BROTHER RAY is standing beneath the framing, addressing two men who are hoisting up a log.
RAY: Up she goes.
RAY turns to another man and slaps him on the back.
RAY: Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?
RAY walks a few paces away, grabs an ax, and lifts it up to a man standing on the church framing.
RAY: Here you are, son.
The man standing on the framing takes the ax. RAY turns to see two men carrying a log into the opening beneath the framing. He waves them in.
RAY: Oh, gentlemen, please.
RAY walks out from beneath the framing and addresses more men carrying logs.
RAY. And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on.
RAY hurries beneath one of the logs and laughs. He turns and looks up at the church framing, smiles, and nods. In a field a little ways off, more men are carrying larger logs towards the church framing. Four men carry each log. A man carrying one of these heavy logs by himself comes into view. He drops the log in front of the church framing and pants, then turns to look out over the landscape. The man is SANDOR CLEGANE, The Hound.
RAY: In all my days I’ve never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
SANDOR: Just one.
RAY: Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.
SANDOR sinks the ax into the log.
SANDOR: He was a woman.
RAY laughs. SANDOR continues chopping. RAY walks away.
CUT TO: BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT
A man standing beneath the church framing rings a bell. All of  the men rush down off the church framing and father at the food stations. The women divvy out food. RAY pours a cup of water and walks among the people. They are all sitting down on the ground and eating. SANDOR is sitting on a rock away from everyone else, eating. RAY approaches him from behind and hands him the cup of water. SANDOR takes it.
RAY: I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
SANDOR: I’m used to it.
SANDOR drinks the entire cup of water.
RAY: When I found you, I thought you’d been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there.
RAY sits down next to SANDOR and points at SANDOR’s right knee.
RAY: I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn’t. Now, I reckoned you’d die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn’t. What kept you going?
SANDOR pauses and stares ahead.
SANDOR: Hate.
SANDOR continues eating.
RAY: No, there’s a reason you’re still here.
SANDOR: Aye, there’s a reason. I’m a big fucker and I’m tough to kill.
RAY: No, a reason. Gods aren’t done with you yet.
SANDOR smiles. RAY stands and walks a few paces away from SANDOR, then turns to face him.
SANDOR: I’ve heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though.
RAY: Well, maybe he was right. I don’t know much about the gods.
SANDOR: You’re in the wrong line of work.
RAY: Oh, there’s plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don’t. I don’t even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it’s the old gods. Or maybe it’s the Lord of Light. Or maybe they’re all the same fucking thing. I don’t know. What matters, I believe, is that there’s something greater than us. And whatever it is, it’s got plans for Sandor Clegane.
SANDOR stops eating and stares up at RAY. RAY nods at him.
SANDOR: You didn’t know me back in my time. You don’t know the things I’ve done.
RAY: I’ve heard stories.
SANDOR: If the gods are real...why haven’t they punished me?
RAY: They have.
RAY walks away. SANDOR stares out across the fields.
HIGH SPARROW: Your Grace. What are we reading today?
MARGAERY: The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12.
MARGAERY: “Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman’s love calm a man’s brute nature. A wife salves her husband’s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”
HIGH SPARROW: You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don’t have a drop of the Mother’s mercy in their blood and savages who can’t read at all who understand the Father’s wisdom.
MARGAERY: For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me.
HIGH SPARROW: They are hard to love.
The HIGH SPARROW sits down on a bench.
HIGH SPARROW: The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we’d look like without our fine clothes. How’d we smell without perfume.
The HIGH SPARROW sighs.
HIGH SPARROW: Can I ask you about a personal matter?
MARGAERY: Of course.
MARGAERY sits on the bench beside the HIGH SPARROW.
HIGH SPARROW: The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven’t joined him in the marriage bed.
MARGAERY: No.
HIGH SPARROW: You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves.
MARGAERY: It’s just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
HIGH SPARROW: Congress does not require desire on the woman’s part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work.
MARGAERY: Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
HIGH SPARROW: Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you’ve made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
The HIGH SPARROW stands.
MARGAERY: My grandmother?
HIGH SPARROW: Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul.
MARGAERY and OLENNA are sitting at a table. SEPTA UNELLA stands several feet away, watching them.
OLENNA: Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
MARGAERY: Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
OLENNA stands.
OLENNA: Oh, this is madness!
OLENNA takes MARGAERY’s hand and leads her out onto the balcony to a different table. SEPTA UNELLA follows them out. MARGAERY sits at the table.
OLENNA (to SEPTA UNELLA): You’re not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...
MARGAERY: Grandmother.
OLENNA: ...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
MARGAERY: Grandmother, please.
OLENNA sits across from MARGAERY.
OLENNA: What have they done to you?
MARGAERY: You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith.
OLENNA: We marched for you.
MARGAERY: The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn’t. They showed mercy.
OLENNA: And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
MARGAERY: Loras’s only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He’ll have to renounce his name and title...
OLENNA: Have you lost your mind?
MARGAERY: ...and live his life as a penitent.
OLENNA: He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.
MARGAERY: He can begin again.
OLENNA: As a mindless fanatic.
MARGAERY: As a free man.
OLENNA: You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
MARGAERY stands.
MARGAERY: I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
MARGAERY walks around the table and kneels before OLENNA. Her back is to SEPTA UNELLA.
MARGAERY: But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home.
OLENNA: I will never leave you. Never.
MARGAERY: You must.
MARGAERY slips a piece of paper into OLENNA’s hand. MARGAERY’s eyes widen.
MARGAERY: Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.
MARGAERY stands.
MARGAERY: The Mother watches over us all.
OLENNA stands.
OLENNA: I’ll see you soon, my dear.
MARGAERY and OLENNA embrace. MARGAERY closes her eyes and then steps back.
MARGAERY: Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.
OLENNA nods and walks back into her chamber. MARGAERY stifles tears. She regains her composure and turns to face SEPTA UNELLA.
MARGAERY: Shall we pray?
OLENNA walks out onto the balcony and shuts the door behind her. She looks around and then unfolds the piece of paper MARGAERY placed in her hand and looks at it. There is a drawing of a rose on it. OLENNA looks up and smiles.
DIM DALBA: We said we’d fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn’t what we agreed to. These aren’t White Walkers. This isn’t an army of the dead. This isn’t our find.
TORMUND: If it weren’t for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King’s army. And I’d be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.
DIM DALBA: Remember Mance’s camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what’s left of us. And if we lose this, we’re gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We’ll be the last of the free folk.
JON SNOW: That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they’ll come for you. You’re right. This isn’t your fight. You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn’t be asking you. It’s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive.
TORMUND gestures to JON SNOW.
TORMUND: The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we’re cowards. And if that’s what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.
WUN WUN stands.
WUN WUN: Snow.
WUN WUN walks away. DIM DALBA looks at the men around him. One of them nods. DIM DALBA walks up to JON SNOW and holds out his hand. JON takes it. DIM DALBA returns to his men.
JON SNOW (to TORMUND): Are you sure they’ll come?
TORMUND: We’re not clever like you southerners. When we say we’ll do something, we do it.
JON SNOW exhales.
CERSEI: I heard you were leaving King’s Landing.
OLENNA: That is hardly your concern.
CERSEI: Your grandson is still a prisoner. You’ll leave him rotting in a cell?
OLENNA: Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
CERSEI: You’re right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
OLENNA: Good.
CERSEI: I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
OLENNA: I wonder if you’re the worst person I’ve ever met. At a certain age, it’s hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I’ll never forget it.
CERSEI: You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It’s the only truth I know. We must defend them.
OLENNA: I’m leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you’re half as bright as you think you are, you’ll find your way out of here, too.
CERSEI: Never. I’ll never leave my son.
OLENNA: What’ll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother’s gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You’re surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You’re going to kill them all by yourself? You’ve lost, Cersei. It’s the only joy I can find in all this misery.
OLENNA goes back to writing.
MAN: Pick the pace up. Keep going.
MAN #2: Keep it moving!
BRONN: Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.
JAIME: Someone certainly does.
JAIME looks at BRONN.
BRONN: Oh, no. Not me. I’m just an upjumped sellsword.
JAIME: You’re an anointed knight. There’s quite a difference.
BRONN: Aye, knights don’t get paid.
JAIME: You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
BRONN: That’s like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
JAIME: I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
BRONN: You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
BRONN: Don’t say it. Don’t fucking say it.
BRONN ushers his horse onwards.
JAIME and BRONN lead a group of Lannister soldiers through the encampment. Some Frey men gather around and stare at them. LOTHAR is standing at the foot of Riverrun, shouting up at the castle walls. BLACK WALDER is behind him, standing on a makeshift hangman’s platform. EDMURE is also on the platform with a noose around his neck. JAIME and BRONN watch them.
LOTHAR: Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we’ll hang him.
BRYNDEN TULLY, the Blackfish, walks along Riverrun’s castle wall and comes to a stop in front of an arrowslit. He stares out at LOTHAR, BLACK WALDER, and EDMURE.
LOTHAR: This is your last warning. Yield the castle.
LOTHAR looks back at BLACK WALDER. BLACK WALDER takes the noose off of EDMURE’s neck and draws a knife.
BLACK WALDER: You think I won’t do it, old man?
BLACK WALDER holds the knife to EDMURE’s neck.
BLACK WALDER: I sliced your niece’s throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
BRYNDEN: Go on, then. Cut his throat.
BRYNDEN walks away. LOTHAR looks at BLACK WALDER and shrugs. BLACK WALDER takes the knife away from EDMURE’s neck. Some Frey men take EDMURE away. JAIME, BRONN, and the Lannister army advance towards LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER, and stop in front of them.
JAIME: Lothar, is it?
LOTHAR: Ser Jaime. We didn’t know you were coming.
JAIME: ‘Cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.
BRONN: Good thing we’re friends or we’d be fucking you in the ass right now.
JAIME: Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
BLACK WALDER waves at the Frey men escorting EDMURE.
BLACK WALDER: Whoa, whoa.
The Frey men stop walking. BLACK WALDER approaches JAIME.
LOTHAR: Walder.
LOTHAR puts his hand out to stop BLACK WALDER, but BLACK WALDER pushes him away. BLACK WALDER walks up to JAIME.
BLACK WALDER: Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
JAIME looks BLACK WALDER up and down.
JAIME: Only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out. Now let’s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I’d do?
JAIME hits BLACK WALDER across the face with his gold hand. BLACK WALDER staggers back beside LOTHAR.
JAIME: I’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you’d like to take his place.
LOTHAR: Apologies, Ser Jaime.
LOTHAR waves at the Frey men escorting EDMURE.
LOTHAR: Do as he says.
JAIME: The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he’ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.
BRONN: Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
JAIME: As I said, the siege is under my command. If that’s not to your liking, go home.
LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER walk away. BRONN walks up behind JAIME.
JAIME: Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
BRONN: A parley or a fight?
JAIME: He’s an old man.
BRONN: You’ve got one hand. My money’s on the old boy.
EXT. BEAR ISLANDThe castle of House Mormont sits atop a high hill. Waterfalls pour out below. A bird screeches.
LYANNA MORMONT sits at a high table flanked by a commander and a maester. JON SNOW, SANSA, and DAVOS enter. Some guards close the doors behind them.
JON SNOW: Lady Mormont.
LYANNA: Welcome to Bear Island.
JON SNOW looks at SANSA.
SANSA: I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I’m sure you will be, too.
LYANNA: I doubt it. My mother wasn’t a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb.
LYANNA: I think we’ve had enough small talk. What are you here?
LYANNA: I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
JON SNOW: Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance.
LYANNA leans towards her maester. They whisper to each other. LYANNA turns back to face JON SNOW.
LYANNA: As far as I understand, you’re a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I’ve heard conflicting reports.
SANSA: I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.
LYANNA: If you say so. In any case, you don’t just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.
LYANNA: I understand that I’m responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else’s war?
JON SNOW and SANSA fall silent. DAVOS steps forward.
DAVOS: If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel.
LYANNA: I don’t know you, Ser…?
DAVOS: Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.
LYANNA turns to her maester.
DAVOS: You needn’t ask your maester about my house. It’s rather new.
LYANNA settles back into her chair.
LYANNA: All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?
DAVOS: You never thought you’d find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I’d be in my position. I was a crabber’s son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I’m here because this isn’t someone else’s war. It’s our war.
LYANNA: Go on, Ser Davos.
DAVOS: Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn’t between a few squabbling houses. It’s between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.
LYANNA: Is this true?
JON SNOW nods.
JON SNOW: Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
DAVOS: As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won’t stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there’s no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together.
LYANNA’s maester leans over to whisper in her ear, but she waves him away.
LYANNA: House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today.
JON SNOW: Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?
LYANNA leans to her military commander and they whisper to each other.
LYANNA: 62.
JON SNOW: 62?
LYANNA: We are not a large house, but we’re a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.
DAVOS: If they’re half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed.
LYANNA smiles and nods.
BRYNDEN: Kingslayer.
JAIME: Blackfish.
BRYNDEN: I assume you’re here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don’t see Sansa and Arya.
JAIME: I don’t have them.
BRYNDEN: Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
JAIME shakes his head.
BRYNDEN: Then why are you here?
BRYNDEN: Or you’ll kill Edmure?
BRYNDEN walks past JAIME.
BRYNDEN: My nephew’s marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
JAIME: It won’t stop with Edmure. You’ll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
BRYNDEN: Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.
JAIME positions himself beside BRYNDEN.
JAIME: We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I’ll spare the lives of your men. On my honor.
BRYNDEN: Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
JAIME: The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?
BRYNDEN turns to face JAIME and walks close to him.
BRYNDEN: As long as I’m standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I’m ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?
BRYNDEN walks past JAIME and continues back across the drawbridge.
JAIME: You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
BRYNDEN turns back to face JAIME.
BRYNDEN: Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.
JAIME: Well, now you have.
BRYNDEN: Aye, now I have. I’m disappointed.
BRYNDEN turns around and walks back inside the castle. The drawbridge begins to close. JAIME scrunches up his face, turns around, and walks back across the bridge.
ROBETT: The answer is no.
JON SNOW: Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.
ROBETT: I’ve heard enough. We’ve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
ROBETT: Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
JON SNOW: House Mormont.
ROBETT: And?
ROBETT: I don’t care about ravens. You’re asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
JON SNOW: The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
ROBETT laughs.
ROBETT: Then the rumors are true. I didn’t dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
ROBETT turns around and heads up the stairs towards a door attended by his men.
JON SNOW: Lord Glover.
ROBETT: There’s nothing else to say.
SANSA: I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.
JON SNOW glares at SANSA. ROBETT turns on his heel and walks up close to SANSA.
ROBETT: Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father’s death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb’s call and hailed him King in the North.
ROBETT gets closer to SANSA.
ROBETT: And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.
ROBETT looks at JON SNOW and then back at SANSA.
ROBETT: I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead.
ROBETT turns, climbs the stairs to the door, and walks through it. SANSA and JON SNOW look down.
Many Ironborn men are communing with prostitutes. THEON sits at a table alone, looking back at forth at them. YARA sits down at his table accompanied by a prostitute. She and the prostitute kiss at length. THEON does not look at them.
THEON: Why did we have to come here?
YARA: Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
THEON: I don’t want one.
YARA sighs and turns back to the prostitute..
YARA: Don’t go far, love.
YARA kisses the prostitutes breast.
YARA: I’ll find you in a bit.
The prostitute stands. YARA kisses her backside and then slaps it. The prostitute giggles and runs away. YARA laughs and grabs a drink.
YARA: Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn’t interest you anymore?
THEON scrunches up his face.
YARA: I’m sorry. I won’t joke about it. I’ll never hurt you, little brother. Don’t you know that?
YARA pours herself another drink.
THEON: You think Uncle Euron’s hunting for us?
YARA: Of course he is. As long as we’re alive, we’re a threat.
THEON: He’ll find us.
YARA: It’s a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.
THEON: I don’t want any.
YARA: I don’t care what you want. Drink.
THEON takes a small sip of his drink.
YARA: Drink it all.
THEON drinks deeper.
YARA: You’re Ironborn, Theon. I know you’ve had some bad years.
THEON: Some bad years?
YARA: But I’m tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.
THEON takes another deep drink.
YARA: Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink.
THEON drinks more deeply..
YARA: You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you’re never going back. We’ll get justice for you.
THEON: If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.
YARA: Fuck justice, then. We’ll get revenge. Drink.
THEON downs the rest of his ale. YARA moves closer to THEON.
YARA: Listen to me. If you’re so broken that there’s no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you’re staying, Theon, I need you. We’re gonna sail to Meereen. We’re gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we’re gonna take back the Iron Islands.
YARA places her hand on the back of THEON’s neck.
YARA: Are you with me? Are you really with me?
THEON slowly raises his head up and locks eyes with YARA. He nods. YARA smiles and kisses his forehead.
YARA: Now, since it’s my last night ashore for a long while, I’m gonna go fuck the tits off this one.
YARA stands, pats THEON on the back, walks over to the prostitute she was communing with earlier, and takes her hand. THEON stares blankly to the side.
DAVOS: Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
SANSA: And that’s a good thing?
DAVOS: He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There’s a stream down there for the horses.
JON SNOW: We’re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
DAVOS: Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.
JON SNOW: We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
They all dismount their horses and begin walking side by side.
SANSA: 62 Mormonts.
DAVOS: It’s not what we’d hoped for. But we still have a chance if we’re careful and smart.
DAVOS spots two men fighting.
DAVOS: For fuck’s sake.
DAVOS hurries over to the men. JON SNOW and SANSA watch him go and then continue walking.
SANSA: So he’s your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
JON SNOW: Ser Davos is the reason I’m standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
SANSA: Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn’t have a head?
SANSA stops walking. JON keeps walking a few paces and then turns to face her.
SANSA: It’s not enough. We need more men.
JON SNOW: There’s no time.
JON SNOW moves close to SANSA.
JON SNOW: We fight with the army we have.
JON SNOW looks over SANSA’s shoulder at DAVOS. He is standing in front of the fighting men, who are wrestling on the ground.
DAVOS: Friends, this is not worth fighting over!
JON SNOW walks past SANSA and away.
DAVOS: This’ll be it, now. Right now, we don’t need to be fighting.
One of the men gets in DAVOS’ face.
MAN: Who the fuck are you?
DAVOS: Hold on.
MAN #2: Yeah, who the fuck are you?
SANSA spies the maester of Bear Island handling some crates containing ravens. He holds up one of the crates to LYANNA MORMONT.
SANSA is writing a letter. She signs her name, pours wax, and presses the wax with the direwolf sigil of House Stark. She picks up the letter and rereads it, then stares ahead.
RAY: I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn’t. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That’s all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I’m your arsonist. Steal that farmer’s crops. Good, I’m your thief. Kill those young lads so they won’t take up arms against us. I’m your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren’t animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy’s throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back.
RAY sits down on a stump next to one of the men and rests his arm on the man’s shoulder.
RAY: That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep.
SANDOR looks down.
RAY: All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son’s name. I’ll hear her screaming the rest of my life.
RAY stands and walks back to the center of the circle.
RAY: Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I’ve got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That’s all any of us can do, isn’t it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people.
RAY stares at SANDOR.
RAY: It’s never too late to come back.
SANDOR returns RAY’s gaze but is distracted by three horsemen coming up the way. RAY turns to look at them. SANDOR walks a few paces into the midst of RAY’s followers and stares at the riders.
RAY: And it’s not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It’s not even about the gods. It’s about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
The three riders reach the group and stop. RAY walks out to meet them. All of RAY’s followers stand. The riders are FLYNN, MORGAN, and LEM LEMONCLOAK.
RAY: Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?
LEM: What are you doing here?
RAY: Well, we’re talking about life. You?
LEM: Protecting the people.
RAY: Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?
LEM: Do you have any horses?
RAY: No horses. No gold. No steel.
LEM: Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work.
RAY: I’m sure it is. You’re welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here.
LEM: Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.
LEM smiles. The three riders turn the horses around and ride off. SANDOR watches them leave.
SANDOR is splitting wood with an ax on a chopping block. RAY walks up the path. SANDOR sees him coming but continues chopping.
SANDOR: “Seven save you, friends.”
RAY: I’m a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?
SANDOR: They don’t believe in your Seven. They’re from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
RAY: Aye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them.
SANDOR stops chopping.
SANDOR: Sure, you do. You’ve got food, you’ve got steel even if you say you don’t. And you’ve got women.
RAY: What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?
SANDOR shrugs and sighs.
RAY: It’d be you against all of them. I mean, these people don’t know how to fight.
SANDOR: You do.
RAY: I’m done with fighting.
SANDOR: Even if it’s to protect yourself?
RAY: Violence is a disease. You don’t cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
SANDOR: You don’t cure it by dying, either.
SANDOR resumes chopping.
RAY: You’ve done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.
RAY starts back up the path.
SANDOR: It’s gonna be a cold night. We’ll need firewood.
RAY: I’ll save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away.
MAN: He’s not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet’s in Slaver’s Bay. I’m inclined to believe him. I’m not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.
ARYA walks up beside the men and addressing the one who was speaking.
ARYA: You’re Westerosi.
MAN: What do you care?
ARYA: I want to book passage home.
The man laughs.
MAN: You? Can’t afford it.
ARYA tosses a bag of coins on the table in front of the man. The man opens it and pulls out some coins.
MAN: Where’d you steal this from?
ARYA: Why do you care?
MAN: We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.
ARYA throws another bag of coins on the table.
ARYA: I want a cabin. And we’ll leave at dawn.
ARYA walks past the man and grabs the coin purses off the table on the way.
ARYA: See you at sunrise.
ARYA walks onto a bridge and stops to stare out at the Titan. An old woman approaches her.
WOMAN: Sweet girl.
ARYA turns to face the old woman. The old woman draws a blade and slashes ARYA across the stomach. She grabs ARYA by the neck and holds her tight to her body, the stabs ARYA severl times in the stomach and twists the blade. With her free hand, she reaches up and pulls off her face, revealing she is the WAIF in disguise. ARYA headbutss the WAIF, pushes her, and then runs and jumps off the opposite side of the bridge, plummeting into the water. The WAIF rushes to the side of the bridge ARYA jumped off and stares into the water. Bubbles and blood rise to the surface. The WAIF straightens her shirt and walks away.
ARYA bursts through the surface of the water, gasping. She pulls herself up onto some steps , turns onto her back, and clutches her bleeding stomach.
ARYA stumbles through the crowd, clutching her bleeding stomach and shivering. She looks from face to face. Everyone stares at her blankly.
The dead bodies of RAY’s followers are strewn all over the ground. SANDOR walks among them. He approaches the church framing. RAY is hanging by the neck from the framing, dead. SANDOR looks up at him and sighs. He walks to a nearby stump and retrieves an ax.
CREDITS
LADY CRANE: My son. My firstborn son. My child king, hush. Listen to the gods, for you they sing. Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won. The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I’ll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life.
The crowd cheers. LADY CRANE and CLARENZO stand and bow. LADY CRANE makes her way backstage. She takes off her wig and sits down at her table in the actors’ break room, wiping her eyes. She takes her bottle of rum and begins to pour herself a glass but stops when she hears a rustling from behind a clothing rack. She stands and walks over to the clothing rack, then parts the clothes. ARYA is lying on the ground behind the rack, bleeding from her stomach.
ARYA is lying in bed. LADY CRANE sits beside her, treating her wounds.
ARYA: You’re good at that. Where did you learn?
LADY CRANE: I’m a jealous woman. I’ve always liked bad men and they’ve always liked me. They’d come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore’s perfume.
LADY CRANE stands and carries her tray of medical supplies into the abutting room.
LADY CRANE: So we’d fight and I’d put a hole in them. And then I’d feel terrible, so I’d patch them up. I got good at patching them up.
ARYA: And good at putting holes in them.
LADY CRANE chuckles. ARYA smiles.
LADY CRANE: And that.
ARYA: What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
LADY CRANE: Bianca.
LADY CRANE spoons soup into a bowl and carries it back to ARYA.
LADY CRANE: She’ll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.
LADY CRANE hands ARYA the bowl. ARYA takes it and slurps, then scrunches up her face.
ARYA: Mmm.
LADY CRANE: I never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.
ARYA: I can’t.
LADY CRANE: Why not? Got a feeling you’d be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress.
ARYA: I don’t think I could remember all of the lines.
LADY CRANE: Come with us. What’s left for you here?
ARYA: You wouldn’t be safe. Not while she’s looking for me.
LADY CRANE: Who?
ARYA: She doesn’t have a name.
LADY CRANE: Where will you go?
ARYA: Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what’s west of Westeros?
LADY CRANE: I don’t know.
ARYA: Nobody does. That’s where all the maps stop.
LADY CRANE: The edge of the world, maybe.
ARYA: I’d like to see that.
ARYA is afflicted with pain from her wound. LADY CRANE stands and pours a milky white liquid into a glass.
ARYA: What’s that?
LADY CRANE: Milk of the poppy.
ARYA: I don’t want any.
LADY CRANE hands ARYA the glass.
LADY CRANE: Sleep is the only way you’ll heal. Trust me, if my soup didn’t kill you, nothing will.
ARYA takes the glass, stares into it, and then drinks it down. She lays back and LADY CRANE tucks her in. ARYA falls asleep. LADY CRANE touches her hand and dims the candlelight.
MAN: Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.
GATINS: I was a famous kisser. You lads know how to kiss proper?
The young men look at each other.
YOUNG MAN: Course we do.
GATINS: This is for masters, this technique. You’re not ready.
YOUNG MAN #2: I’m ready.
MAN: He says he’s ready.
GATINS: All right.
GATINS stands and walks over to YOUNG MAN #2. YOUNG MAN #2 stands.
GATINS: Now, pay attention. You put your left hand on the back of the lady’s head.
GATINS puts his left hand on the back of YOUNG MAN #2’s head.
GATINS: Your right hand holds the small of the lady’s back like so.
GATINS puts his right hand on the small of YOUNG MAN #2’s back.
GATINS: Very romantic. Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole.
GATINS shoves his hand down the back of YOUNG MAN #2’s pants. YOUNG MAN #2 flails and pulls away. The other middle-aged man bursts out laughing. GATINS smells his finger.
MAN: So fucking close!
GATINS: Ah, it smells like pussy to me.
MAN: Look at him. You get hard, boy?
YOUNG MAN #2: Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.
GATINS sits back down next to the fire. YOUNG MAN #2 remains standing, fixing his pants. SANDOR appears, carrying an ax. He is walking towards YOUNG MAN #2. YOUNG MAN #2 has his back turned to him.
YOUNG MAN #2: Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?
The other three men spot SANDOR coming. They stand. YOUNG MAN #2 turns around to see what’s coming. SANDOR growls and decapitates him. SANDOR approaches the second young man and drives his ax into his chest. The middle-aged man approaches SANDOR from behind with a sword. SANDOR spins around and slices his throat open. SANDOR lunges at GATINS and drives his axe into his groin, then rips it away. Blood spills out and GATINS falls to his knees, whimpering. SANDOR puts his hand on GATINS’ head, forcing him to look up.
SANDOR: Where’s the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.
GATINS: Fuck you!
SANDOR: Those are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better.
GATINS: Cunt!
SANDOR: You’re shit at dying, you know that?
SANDOR raises the ax above his head, growls, and buries it into GATINS.
RED PRIESTESS (speaking Valyrian): From the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again.
TYRION and VARYS enter, walking together through the courtyard. TYRION smiles.
TYRION: I’d call that a successful gambit.
VARYS: Would you?
TYRION: Look around. The city has come back to life.
VARYS: You made a pact with fanatics.
TYRION: I did and it worked.
VARYS: If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you’d say the razor worked. That doesn’t mean it won’t cut your throat.
TYRION: Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
TYRION and VARYS stop walking and stare out through an archway at the harbor.
TYRION: I’m going to miss you.
VARYS: I know.
TYRION: I hope you’re right about this expedition of yours.
VARYS: If I don’t return, you’ll know I was wrong.
TYRION broods. VARYS looks at him.
VARYS:We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
TYRION: Most of all, we need our queen.
VARYS: She’ll come back. She has to. My heart’s been broken too many times already.
VARYS pats TYRION on the shoulder.
VARYS: I’ll walk the rest of the way myself. I can’t go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
TYRION smiles. VARYS walks on.
TYRION: Varys.
VARYS turns back and looks at TYRION.
TYRION: The most famous dwarf in the world.
VARYS smiles and nods, then walks out into the harbor. TYRION walks back through the courtyard.
QYBURN: Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.
CERSEI: Have been permitted? That’s rather a tortured way of putting it.
QYBURN: They demand to see you, Your Grace.
CERSEI: Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
QYBURN says nothing.
CERSEI: The king is aware of their presence?
QYBURN: He is, Your Grace. He’s currently in his chambers at prayer.
CERSEI stands and walks past QYBURN out into the hall. QYBURN bows to her as she passes, then follows her out with GREGOR in tow. At the bottom of the steps, LANCEL and a group of Faith Militant are waiting. CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR approach them. One of the Faith Militant stares up at GREGOR.
LANCEL: Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.
CERSEI: His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
LANCEL: Your Grace, this is not a request.
CERSEI: It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I’m refusing.
LANCEL: The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?
CERSEI: He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
CERSEI: Get out.
LANCEL nods at the Faith Militant. Two of them advance with spikes clubs. GREGOR steps in front of CERSEI.
LANCEL (to GREGOR): Move aside, ser.
GREGOR silently stares out from behind his helmet.
LANCEL (to CERSEI): Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.
CERSEI: I choose violence.
One of the Faith Militant swings his club into GREGOR’s chestplate. GREGOR is unaffected. The club is stuck in the metal of the armor and the Faith Militant man struggles to wrench it free. He pulls it loose and reels back for another swing, but GREGOR takes him by the throat with one hand and lifts him up off the ground. LANCEL and the other Faith Militant regroup in the courtyard. The man in GREGOR’s grasp gasps and drops his club. GREGOR tosses him out into the courtyard, then follows him out. GREGOR kneels over the man, grabs him by the jaw, and rips his head off. LANCEL looks around at the other Faith Militant. CERSEI smiles.
CERSEI: Please tell His High Holiness he’s always welcome to visit.
CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR turn to walk back up the steps.
EXT. RIVERRUNBRIENNE and PODRICK arrive on horseback. They stare out at the Lannister/Frey encampment from an overlooking hill.
PODRICK: Looks like a siege, my lady.
BRIENNE: You have a keen military mind, Pod.
BRIENNE spots JAIME riding a white horse among his men.
PODRICK: My lady. My lady.
Several Lannister soldiers ride towards BRIENNE and PODRICK, and then encircle them.
MAN: Who goes there? State your business!
BRIENNE: My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I’ve come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
PODRICK watches Lannister soldiers riding through the encampment. His is choked from behind by an unknown man who reveals himself to be BRONN.
BRONN: Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren’t we?
BRONN releases PODRICK. PODRICK coughs. BRONN laughs and slaps PODRICK on the shoulder.
BRONN: Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you’d be dead by now.
PODRICK: Not yet.
BRONN laughs and motions to a nearby tent.
BRONN: Are they in there?
PODRICK: Mm-hmm.
BRONN: You think they’re fucking?
PODRICK: What? No.
BRONN: Why not? I’d fuck her. You’d fuck her, wouldn’t you?
PODRICK: I’m her squire.
BRONN: Oh. Well, he’d fuck her, that’s for sure. And she’s fuck him, don’t you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you’re the one with the magic cock.
BRONN grabs PODRICK’s crotch.
BRONN: You must have shown it to her by now.
PODRICK: She’s training me to fight.
BRONN: Is she? Oh.
PODRICK: An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day.
BRONN: Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
PODRICK: Well, that’s a different sort of fighting.
BRONN: Now, that’s the truth, isn’t it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?
PODRICK smiles and nods.
BRONN: All right, let’s start with your footwork.
BRONN stands across from PODRICK.
BRONN: Show me your stance.
PODRICK postures up.
BRONN: Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?
PODRICK looks down at his feet. BRONN slaps him across the face.
BRONN: Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don’t sulk.
CUT TO: JAIME’S TENT
BRIENNE and JAIME stand across from each other.
JAIME: I never thought you’d find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
BRIENNE: Why would you assume that?
JAIME: In my experience, girls like her don’t live very long.
BRIENNE: I don’t think you know many girls like her.
JAIME: Well, I’m proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds.
JAIME walks around the room and comes to a stop on BRIENNE’s other side. BRIENNE turns to face him.
JAIME: Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey’s murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?
BRIENNE: I’ve come for the Blackfish.
JAIME: You’re welcome to have him.
BRIENNE: Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
JAIME: With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
BRIENNE: The Tully army.
JAIME: They’re a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum.
BRIENNE: The Tullys are rebels because they’re fighting for their home?
JAIME: Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
BRIENNE: As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
JAIME: Exactly.
JAIME and BRIENNE stare at each other.
JAIME: We shouldn’t argue about politics.
BRIENNE: You’re a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I’ve seen it myself.
JAIME: I’m a Lannister. Don’t ask me to betray my own house.
BRIENNE: I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
JAIME: What do you propose?
BRIENNE: Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
JAIME: Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
BRIENNE: Because you’ll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
JAIME: Have you ever met the Blackfish?
BRIENNE: No.
JAIME: He’s even more stubborn than you are.
BRIENNE looks down. JAIME walks back around the table to BRIENNE’s other side.
JAIME: All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won’t listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else’s home.
BRIENNE: I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you’ll grant us safe passage north.
JAIME: You have my word. You have until nightfall.
BRIENNE nods and undoes her sword belt. She hands Oathkeeper to JAIME. JAIME sighs.
BRIENNE: You gave it to me for a purpose. I’ve achieved that purpose.
JAIME: It’s yours. It will always be yours.
BRIENNE stares into JAIME’s eyes, then ties Oathkeeper back on her waist and begins to walk out. JAIME follows her to the entrance of the tent. BRIENNE turns back.
BRIENNE: one last thing, Ser Jaime.
JAIME: Yes, Lady Brienne?
BRIENNE: Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa’s kin.
JAIME: Of course it does.
BRIENNE: To fight you.
JAIME: Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.
BRIENNE and JAIME stare into each other’s eyes. BRIENNE exits. JAIME watches her go.
BRIENNE and PODRICK follow BRYNDEN holding a piece of parchment as he walks along the walls of Riverrun.
BRYNDEN: I’ve said no three times already.
BRIENNE: I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
BRYNDEN: I haven’t seen her since she was a child. I don’t know her signature. I don’t know you. And I will not surrender.
BRYNDEN turns to one of his soldiers.
BRYNDEN: Double the guards tonight.
BRYNDEN looks out at the Lannister/Frey encampment.
BRYNDEL The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.
BRYNDEN turns on his heel and walks inside. BRIENNE and PODRICK follow him.
BRYNDEN: Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man.
BRIENNE: He always spoke highly of you.
BRYNDEN: And if he were here now, I’d tell him the same I’m telling you.
BRYNDEN makes his way down a set of steps.
BRYNDEN: If you think I’m abandoning my family’s seat on the Kingslayer’s word of honor, you’re a bloody fool.
BRIENNE: Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
BRYNDEN: We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
BRYNDEN, BRIENNE, and PODRICK emerge into Riverrun’s main courtyard.
BRIENNE: He’s not my friend.
BRYNDEN: No?
BRYNDEN stops and turns back to face BRIENNE.
BRYNDEN: Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
BRIENNE: Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die.
BRIENNE holds out the piece of parchment to BRYNDEN. BRYNDEN takes it, unfolds it, and reads its contents. He smiles and chuckles under his breath.
BRYNDEN: She’s exactly like her mother.
BRIENNE smiles. BRYNDEN turns back to face her.
BRYNDEN: I don’t have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
BRIENNE: You have more than she does.
BRYNDEN: She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.
BRYNDEN hands the letter back to BRIENNE. She takes it. BRYNDEN walks away.
BRIENNE (to PODRICK): Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
PODRICK: What should I write?
BRIENNE: Tell her I failed.
CERSEI: There’s to be a royal announcement?
KEVAN: There is.
CERSEI: Why wasn’t I informed?
KEVAN: There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
CERSEi starts up the steps but KEVAN blocks her with his arm.
KEVAN: Where are you going?
CERSEI: To stand by my son.
KEVAN: Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.
CERSEI stares at TOMMEN. TOMMEN looks away. MAESTER PYCELLE whispers to him. CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR move to one of the nearby balconies. TOMMEN sits on the Iron Throne and addresses the crowd.
TOMMEN: Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister’s trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.
Members of the crowd murmur to one another.
TOMMEN: Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all.
CROWD: Seven blessings.
TOMMEN stands and makes his way out of the hall, accompanied by the goldcloaks. CERSEI watches him leave. QYBURN walks up beside CERSEi and whispers to her.
QYBURN: Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
CERSEI: And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
QYBURN: More. Much more.
MISSANDEI: You seem happy.
TYRION: I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.
TYRION puts down his glass of wine on a table and pours another glass of wine.
TYRION: Now it’s like a man reborn.
MISSANDEI: I will be happy when our queen returns.
TYRION: Why don’t you drink? Why don’t either of you ever drink?
TYRION pours a third glass of wine.
GREY WORM: Unsullied never drink.
TYRION: Why not?
GREY WORM: Rules.
TYRION: And who made these rules? Your former masters?
GREY WORM and MISSANDEI look at each other.
TYRION: Those miserable old shits didn’t want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
TYRION hands GREY WORM one of the glasses of wine. GREY WORM takes it.
TYRION (to MISSANDEI): And you? What’s your excuse?
GREY WORM sniffs his glass of wine and scrunches up his face. TYRION hands MISSANDEI the second glass of wine. She takes it.
MISSANDEI: I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
TYRION: That’s how you know it’s working.
TYRION returns to his glass of wine and raises it up.
TYRION: Here’s to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
GREY WORM and MISSANDEI raise their glasses.
TYRION: To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.
GREY WORM & MISSANDEI: Long may she reign.
GREY WORM and MISSANDEI sip from their glasses. TYRION drinks all of his.
TYRION: Do you like it?
GREY WORM: Tastes like it has turned.
TYRION walks to another decanter on the opposite side of the room and pours himself another glass of wine.
TYRION: Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I’d like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp’s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.
TYRION sips his wine.
TYRION: Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.
TYRION walks back in front of GREY WORM and MISSANDEI.
MISSANDEI: I do not know any jokes.
TYRION: Grey worm?
GREY WORM stares and says nothing.
MISSANDEI sips her wine.
TYRION: ...but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”
GREY WORM and MISSANDEI do not laugh.
TYRION: It’s funnier in Westeros.
GREY WORM: The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies.
TYRION: Yes.
MISSANDEI: A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily.
TYRION: A story that’s supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps.
MISSANDEI sips her wine again.
TYRION: Missandei, do you like the wine?
MISSANDEI: I do.
TYRION: Tell a joke.
MISSANDEI: Two translators are on a sinking ship.
TYRION smiles.
MISSANDEI: The first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.”
There is a pause.
TYRION Ah!
TYRION begins to laugh. MISSANDEI smiles and sips her wine.
GREY WORM: That is the worst joke I ever heard.
MISSANDEI: You don’t even know what a joke is.
GREY WORM: I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
TYRION: You lied to us.
GREY WORM: I make joke.
MISSANDEI and TYRION laugh. GREY WORM smiles.
MISSANDEI: More jokes.
Bells begin to ring. GREY WORM stands and runs out of the room, shouting in Valyrian.
A fleet of white-sailed ships approaches Meereen. TYRION and MISSANDEI stare at at the ships.
MISSANDEI: The Masters have come for their property.
JAIME: Lord Edmure.
EDMURE’s hands are behind his back, his wrists bound around a vertical pole in the center of the tent. He is kneeling.
JAIME: I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you’ll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
EDMURE stands.
EDMURE: I have your word?
EDMURE scoffs.
JAIME: The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I’ve heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You’re a potent man.
EDMURE: A son I’ve never met born of a wife that I haven’t seen since our first night together.
JAIME: You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he’ll have a keep of his own.
EDMURE: Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you’ve massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
JAIME: I’ll remind you that our houses are at war. I’m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.
EDMURE: Says the man who shoved his sword through his king’s back.
JAIME: Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It’s not.
JAIME sits on a barrel in the corner of the room.
EDMURE: You understand. On some level you understand that you’re an evil man.
JAIME: I’ll leave the judgments to the gods.
EDMURE: Well, that is convenient for you. You’re a fine-looking fellow, aren’t you?
EDMURE chuckles.
EDMURE: Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we’re decent, don’t we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you’re decent after everything that you’ve done?
JAIME: I was your sister’s prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
EDMURE laughs.
EDMURE: Yeah. She should have killed you.
JAIME: Perhaps, but she didn’t. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn’t hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son.
EDMURE: Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don’t?
JAIME: No, I don’t, but I’m telling you anyway because you’re my prisoner. You don’t have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister.
EDMURE: Oh. Oh, I see. You’re a madman.
EDMURE: Don’t talk about Cat!
JAIME: I’ll talk about whomever I want.
EDMURE grunts and struggles against his bindings.
JAIME: She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there’s a fierceness you don’t often see.
JAIME stands and walks closer to EDMURE.
JAIME: They’d do anything to protect their babies.
JAIME gets in EDMURE’s face.
JAIME: Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
EDMURE: You didn’t come here to talk about our sisters.
JAIME: That’s exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn’t matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I’ll send for your baby boy.
EDMURE struggles against his bindings, pushing himself towards JAIME.
JAIME: And I’ll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don’t matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn’t matter to me. The people in the castle don’t matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that’s what I’ll do.
EDMURE crosses the bridge over Riverrun’s moat, carrying a torch. Several guards point crossbows down at him. He stops at the end of the bridge.
GUARD CAPTAIN: Who goes there?
EDMURE: Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry.
BRYNDEN appears on the wall with the guards.
BRYNDEN: Don’t let him in.
GUARD CAPTAIN: He’s the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.
BRYNDEN: He’s been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it’s a trap, you idiot. Don’t let him in.
BRYNDEN turns to walk away.
GUARD CAPTAIN: He’s my lord, my lord. I’ve sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.
BRYNDEN turns back.
BRYNDEN: You’re not obeying Edmure’s commands. You’re obeying the fucking Kinglsayer’s commands.
EDMURE (O.S.): I demand entry.
GUARD CAPTAIN: My lord has given an order.
BRYNDEN: WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.
The guard captain turns to his fellow guards.
BRYNDEN unsheathes his sword halfway. The guard captain and the other guards show their steel.
BRYNDEN: I’ll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
GUARD CAPTAIN: You are not lord of this castle, my lord.
BRYNDEN looks around at the other guards, sheathes his sword, and walks away.
GUARD CAPTAIN: Lower the drawbridge!
GUARD: Aye, ser!
The drawbridge begins to open. EDMURE stares back across the Lannister/Frey encampment. JAIME waits on his horse. BLACK WALDER rides up beside JAIME. The drawbridge fully extends. EDMURE walks inside.
BLACK WALDER (to JAIME): If you’re wrong, we’re just surrendered our most valuable prisoner.
The drawbridge closes behind EDMURE. Riverrun soldiers are gathered to meet him. BRYNDEN appears in the rear of their ranks. EDMURE spots BRYNDEN, hands his torch to one of the soldiers, and walks up the stairs to the top of the outer wall.
GUARD CAPTAIN: Welcome home, my lord.
EDMURE: Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms. Open the gates.
EDMURE: Your lord has given a command.
The drawbridge opens. JAIME glances at BLACK WALDER and rides towards Riverrun. The Lannister and Frey forces follow him into Riverrun.
EDMURE: Find the Blackfish. Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.
GUARD CAPTAIN (to a guard): Find him.
The Riverrun soldiers lay down their arms in a pile as the Lannister forces enter the castle.
BRYNDEN, PODRICK, and BRIENNE emerge from a doorway. BRYNDEN places the torch in a sconce and stands in the doorway. PODRICK gets onto a small rowboat floating on the surface of the river. BRIENNE kneels to steady the rowboat for PODRICK, then turns back to look at BRYNDEN.
BRYNDEN: Go on.
BRYNDEN stands and faces him.
BRIENNE: Come with us.
BRYNDEN: I’ve run before from the Red Wedding. I’m not running again. This is my family home.
BRIENNE: Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don’t die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
BRYNDEN: You’ll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.
Some guards begin shouting in the background.
BRYNDEN: Go on, now.
BRYNDEN unsheathes his sword.
BRYNDEN: I haven’t had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I’ll make a damn fool of myself.
BRYNDEN heads through the doorway and back up the steps. BRIENNE watches him leave and then gets on the rowboat.
Lannister and Frey banners are being draped all over the courtyard. Lannister soldiers walk over the fallen Tully banners.
JAIME stands atop the outer wall. A Lannister guard enters and approaches him.
GUARD: We found the Blackfish, my lord.
JAIME: Good. Bring him to me.
GUARD: He died fighting, my lord.
JAIME nods to the guard. The guard exits. JAIME stares out at the river and sees BRIENNE and PODRICK rowing away from Riverrun. He looks around to see if anyone else is watching. BRIENNE looks over her shoulder and sees JAIME standing atop the wall. JAIME waves to her. BRIENNE waves back.
TYRION and MISSANDEI enter. GREY WORM is waiting for them. Many Unsullied stand guard around the room.
TYRION: I was wrong. I admit it.
MISSANDEI: That changes nothing.
GREY WORM: No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
GREY WORM: You’re trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.
TYRION: All right, what should the army do?
GREY WORM: We’ll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here.
TYRION: And then?
GREY WORM: We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.
Something thuds and rattles the roof of the pyramid. Footsteps can be heard. Everyone looks up. MISSANDEI grabs a knife from a table and stands beside TYRION. GREY WORM and the Unsullied form up in front of the door to the balcony. One Unsullied opens the door. Another inches out through it, shield and spear in hand. The Unsullied man looks side to side and sees nothing, but then sees something and kneels. The rest of the Unsullied follow suit. DAENERYS enters. A dragon screeches and flies away in the background.
BERIC: Clegane.
THOROS: What the fuck you doing here?
SANDOR: Chasing them. You?
THOROS: Hanging them.
SANDOR: Any particular reason?
BERIC: They’re our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
SANDOR: Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
THOROS: You’ve got friends?
SANDOR: Not anymore. They’re mine.
SANDOR advances. BERIC and another member of the Brotherhood block his path.
BERIC: It’s the Brotherhood’s good name they’ve dragged through the dirt.
SANDOR: Fuck your name. They’re mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again.
One of the Brotherhood members notches an arrow and points his bow at SANDOR.
SANDOR: Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.
SANDOR points his ax at the man but keeps his eyes locked on BERIC.
SANDOR: Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
SANDOR walks towards the bowman.
BERIC: You can have one of them.
SANDOR turns back to face BERIC, glances at the men about to be hanged, then looks back at BERIC.
SANDOR: Two.
BERIC looks at THOROS. THOROS nods. BERIC nods to SANDOR. SANDOR approaches one of the men and raises his ax above his head to swing. THOROS catches the ax’s handle from behind.
THOROS: No, no, no.
SANDOR turns to face THOROS and tries to wrench his ax free.
THOROS: We’re not butchers. We hang them.
THOROS releases SANDOR’s ax.
SANDOR: hanging? All over in an instant. Where’s the punishment in that?
THOROS: They die.
SANDOR: We all bloody die.
SANDOR gestures to BERIC.
SANDOR: Except this one here. I’ll only gut one of them.
BERIC: No.
SANDOR: I’ll chop off one hand.
BERIC: We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That’s generous.
SANDOR: Bunch of nancies.
SANDOR throws down his ax.
SANDOR: There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
THOROS: You’re getting old, Clegane.
SANDOR: He’s not.
SANDOR kicks the box out from underneath one of the men, hanging him. He moves in front of LEM.
LEM: Please don’t. I’ll give you anything.
SANDOR kicks the box out from underneath LEM, hanging him. LEM gasps for air. BERIC hangs the third man. SANDOR pulls the boot off of LEM’s foot. BERIC and THOROS begin to walk away, but turn back to look at SANDOR. SANDOR takes off his own boot and sizes up LEM’s boot to his own foot. He shoves his foot into LEM’s boot and looks up at BERIC and THOROS.
SANDOR: Got anything to eat?
Several members of the Brotherhood are sitting around small campfires. SANDOR, BERIC, and some other Brothers are sitting at one such campfire. SANDOR is eating a piece of meat. THOROS approaches and sits beside them.
THOROS (to SANDOR): Enjoying yourself?
SANDOR: I prefer chicken.
THOROS hands SANDOR a water skin. SANDOR drinks from it.
BERIC: You ought to join us. We could use you.
SANDOR: I tried joining. Didn’t work out for me.
THOROS: Clegane, we’re here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves.
SANDOR: Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
SANDOR returns the water skin to THOROS, stands, walks to the river, and urinates into it.
BERIC: Cold winds are rising in the North.
SANDOR: And you’re going to go stop them?
BERIC: We need good men to help us.
SANDOR: Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me.
BERIC: True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
SANDOR laughs.
SANDOR: I beat you because I’m better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I’m better than you now.
SANDOR returns to his spot by the campfire and sits.
BERIC: Aye, you’re probably right. You’re a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we’re fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you’ve harmed Clegane, it’s not too late for you.
ARYA: Lady Crane?
ARYA gets out of bed and winces. She walks towards the abutting room.
ARYA: Lady Crane?
ARYA enters the abutting room and sees LADY CRANE lying crumpled on top of the stool, dead. Blood is pooled on the ground beneath her.
WAIF: If you’d have done your job, she would have died painlessly.
ARYA turns to see the WAIF standing in the doorway with a knife. The WAIF approaches ARYA slowly and ARYA backs away, matching her pace.
WAIF: Instead…
The WAIF holds out her arms.
WAIF: The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can’t change that. I can’t change that. No one can. And now he’s been promised another name.
ARYA turns around, runs out onto the balcony, and jumps off. She grunts as her hands and feet connect with the ground. The sprints off through the streets, pushing people out of the way. The WAIF emerges from the door to LADY CRANE’s apartment, spies ARYA, and chases after her. ARYA runs through an alleyway. A man pushes a cart in her way. She slides underneath it and continues running. The WAIF jumps clean over the cart. ARYA turns a corner and runs down a set of stairs. A woman dumps a barrel of water on the ground outside the door to a room at the bottom of the steps. ARYA sees her and darts into the room. The WAIF turns the corner to the steps but stops when she does not see ARYA. The room ARYA has entered is a sauna. She moves through it. A number of men in towels are relaxing in the heat. ARYA emerges from the door on the opposite side of the sauna and looks around. She enters the crowd, walking through it. The WAIF appears on a high wall behind her, then jumps down into the crowd. ARYA turns back to see her and runs away. The WAIF pursues her. ARYA reaches the end of the marketplace and jumps off a high wall. She lands on a large set of steps where many fruit merchants have laid their baskets. She tumbles down the steps, knocking over the baskets as she goes and grunting with pain. The crowd clamors. ARYA comes to a stop at the bottom of the steps. She puts her hand to her stomach. Her hand comes away bloody. The WAIF appears at the top of the steps. ARYA sees her, stands, and throws herself over a small wall into an alleyway. The WAIF follows her. ARYA whimpers as she moves through the alleyway. She leaves blood stains on everything she touches. She enters a small, dark room, lit by a single candle. The WAIF follows her inside, knife in hand. ARYA kneels in the small living space she has made for herself. The WAIF enters and shuts the door behind her.
WAIF: It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?
ARYA retrieves Needle from beneath a blanket and stands.
WAIF: Haven’t we been through this already? That won’t help you.
The WAIF advances. ARYA holds Needle up in front of her face, closes her eyes, and cuts the candle in half. The room goes dark.
JAQEN enters the main hall. He notices a blood trail on the floor leading to the Hall of Faces. He follows the trail and enters the Hall. The trail leads to one of the columns bearing the faces. The WAIF’s bloody face rests in one of the sconces.
ARYA: You told her to kill me.
ARYA appears behind JAQEN, pointing Needle at him. JAQEN turns to face her.
JAQEN: Yes. But here you are. And there she is.
JAQEN pushes his chest against Needle’s point.
JAQEN: Finally a girl is no one.
ARYA: A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I’m going home.
JAQEN smiles. ARYA turns and exits.
CREDITS
TYRION: Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise.
An explosion occurs outside.
TYRION: Perhaps we should take shelter.
An explosion occurs outside.
DAENERYS: The city is on the rise?
TYRION: Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
An explosion occurs outside.
TYRION: Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…
An explosion occurs outside.
TYRION: ...it proves that no one needs a Master.
DAENERYS: Good. Shall we begin?
TYRION: Do we have a plan?
DAENERYS: I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan.
TYRION tightens his jaw and looks away.
DAENERYS: You don’t approve?
TYRION: You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
An explosion occurs outside.
TYRION: Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That’s why Jaime killed him.
DAENERYS: This is entirely different.
TYRION: You’re talking about destroying cities. It’s not entirely different. I’d like to suggest an alternate approach.
A blast causes the window across the room to explode inward, sending shards of wood flying everywhere. DAENERYS and TYRION duck, then turn to look at the window.
DAENERYS, TYRION, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and an assembly of Unsullied stand across from the three Masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION, and a group of their soldiers.
RAZDAL (to DAENERYS): Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver’s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.
TYRION: We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.
YEZZAN: The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
DAENERYS: We obviously didn’t communicate clearly. We’re here to discuss your surrender, not mine.
RAZDAL: I imagine it’s difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
DAENERYS: My reign has just begun.
A dragon screeches in the distance. YEZZAN turns to look in the direction of the screech. DROGON flies up over the plateau and lands on an overlooking structure. He roars and drops down beside DAENERYS. DAENERYS climbs on his back and they fly off over Meereen. When they pass over the entrance to the catacombs, RHAEGAL and VISERION bust down the door with flame and take flight to join them. The ensemble flies over the beach entrance to Meereen.
A group of the Sons of the Harpy are slaughtering citizens of Meereen. Galloping footsteps can be heard in the distance. One of the Sons of the Harpy turns to look in the direction of the sound. The Dothraki horde led by DAARIO rounds the bend of a nearby cliff, yelling war cries and charging full force towards the Sons of the Harpy on horseback. DAARIO beheads a Son of the Harpy.
DAENERYS and the dragons fly over the Masters’ ships. The soldiers on the ships stop what they’re doing and stare up at the dragons. DAENERYS and DROGON come to a halt and hover in front of one of the ships.
DAENERYS: Dracarys.
The dragons shoot stream of fire down at the the ship. The ship becomes engulfed in flame and the soldiers scream as they die. The ship incinerates and capsizes.
GREY WORM steps forward and addresses the Masters’ soldiers.
GREY WORM (speaking Valyrian): You men have a choice:
The Unsullied ready their spears. The Masters’ soldiers ready their swords.
GREY WORM: ...fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families.
A dragon screeches in the distance. The Masters’ soldiers lay down their arms and run away.
TYRION: Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.
MISSANDEI: Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
TYRION: It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying?
RAZDAL grabs YEZZAN.
RAZDAL: Him. He should die.
BELICHO: Yes, him.
TYRION looks at GREY WORM.
RAZDAL: He’s not one of us. He’s an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us.
GREY WORM approaches the YEZZAN and stares in his eyes.
YEZZAN: Please.
YEZZAN falls to his knees. GREY WORM unsheathes his dagger and slices RAZDAL and BELICHO’s throats. He sheathes his dagger and steps back. TYRION approaches YEZZAN and puts his hand on his shoulder.
TYRION: Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.
TYRION pats YEZZAN on the shoulder. He, GREY WORM, and MISSANDEI walk away.
JON SNOW: You don’t have to be here.
SANSA: Yes, I do.
RAMSAY: My beloved wife. I’ve missed you terribly.
RAMSAY looks at JON SNOW.
RAMSAY: Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night’s Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don’t have the men, you don’t have the horses, and you don’t have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There’s no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I’m a man of mercy.
JON SNOW: You’re right. There’s no need for a battle. Thousands of men don’t need to die. Only one of us. Let’s end this the old way. You against me.
RAMSAY chuckles.
RAMSAY: I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you’re the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don’t know if I’d beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?
JON SNOW: Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them?
RAMSAY points at JON SNOW.
RAMSAY: He’s good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you’re too proud to surrender?
SANSA: How do we know you have him?
RAMSAY nods to SMALLJON. SMALLJON pulls SHAGGYDOG’s head out from a satchel and throws it on the ground.
RAMSAY: Now, if you want to save —
SANSA: You’re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well.
SANSA turns her horse and rides away.
RAMSAY (to JON SNOW): She’s a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you’re all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven’t fed them for seven days. They’re ravenous. I wonder which parts they’ll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We’ll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard.
RAMSAY and company ride back towards Winterfell. JON SNOW looks down.
JON SNOW, DAVOS, TORMUND, and SANSA are standing around a planning table.
JON SNOW: If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.
DAVOS: That’s not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they’ll stop fearing him. He can’t have that. Fear is his power.
JON SNOW: It’s his weakness, too. His mean don’t want to fight for him. They’re forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...
TORMUND: It’s not his men that worry me. It’s his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
TORMUND looks at DAVOS.
TORMUND: You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
JON SNOW: We’re digging trenches all along our flanks. They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.
TORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW.
JON SNOW: A pincer move.
TORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW. JON SNOW and DAVOS look at each other briefly.
JON SNOW: They won’t be able to hit us from the sides.
TORMUND: Good.
DAVOS: It’s crucial that we let them charge at us. They’ve got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he’ll pursue. Then we’ll have him surrounded on three sides.
TORMUND (to JON SNOW): Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
JON SNOW: No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
DAVOS: We should all get some sleep.
TORMUND: Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.
DAVOS, TORMUND, and any remaining attendants exit. JON SNOW sits down at the head of the table.
SANSA: So you’ve met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans.
JON SNOW: Aye, for what they’re worth.
SANSA: You’ve known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don’t know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?
JON SNOW: You’re right.
SANSA: You think he’s going to fall into your trap. He won’t He’s the one who lays traps.
JON SNOW: He’s overconfident.
SANSA: He plays with people. He’s far better at it than you. He’s been doing it all his life.
JON SNOW stands.
JON SNOW: Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.
SANSA: You don’t know him.
JON SNOW: All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?
SANSA: We’ll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay’s claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won’t live long.
JON SNOW: We can’t give up on our brother.
SANSA: Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.
JON SNOW: Of course he does. What should I do differently?
SANSA: I don’t know! I don’t know anything about battles! Just don’t do what he wants you to do.
JON SNOW: Aye, that’s good advice.
SANSA: You think that’s obvious?
JON SNOW: Well, it is a bit obvious.
SANSA: If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?
JON SNOW: When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men!
SANSA: It’s not enough!
JON SNOW: Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds.
SANSA: If Ramsay wins, I’m not going back there alive. Do you understand me?
JON SNOW I won’t ever let him touch you again. I’ll protect you, I promise.
SANSA: No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
SANSA exits. JON SNOW turns, looks at the table, and sighs.
CUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT
DAVOS and TORMUND are walking together through the encampment.
DAVOS: You think there’s hope?
TORMUND: I’ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they’ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there’s hope. You want to avenge your king, don’t you?
DAVOS: It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
TORMUND: You saw these demons?
DAVOS: What?
They stop walking. DAVOS looks at TORMUND.
DAVOS: No, it’s a manner of speaking. Not actual demons.
TORMUND: Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn’t have demons in his skull. He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you.
DAVOS: Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.
TORMUND: Jon Snow’s not a king.
DAVOS: No, he’s not.
TORMUND and DAVOS smile at each other.
TORMUND: I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
DAVOS: No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle.
TORMUND: So what do you do all night?
DAVOS: I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
TORMUND laughs.
TORMUND: Happy shitting.
TORMUND walks away.
MELISANDRE is sitting at a desk with a mirror and candles on it, staring into a fire pit. JON SNOW enters and approaches her.
JON SNOW: My lady. You weren’t at the war council.
MELISANDRE: I’m not a soldier.
JON SNOW: Any advice?
MELISANDRE: Don’t lose.
JON SNOW: If I do, if I fall, don’t bring me back.
MELISANDRE: I’ll have to try.
JON SNOW: I’m ordering you not to bring me back.
MELISANDRE: I am not your servant, Jon Snow.
JON SNOW: You’re in my camp. I’m the commander.
MELISANDRE: I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
JON SNOW: How do you know what he commands?
MELISANDRE: I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn’t want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you.
JON SNOW: Why?
MELISANDRE: I don’t know. Maybe you’re only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
JON SNOW: What kind of god would do something like that?
MELISANDRE: The one we’ve got.
JON SNOW stares into the fire pit and then exits.
DAVOS is walking alone through the snow. He happens upon a pile of wooden rubble and stops to inspect it. He sees a charred statuette of a stag in the wood and stops to pick it up. He looks back at the pile of wood. A horn blows in the distance. DAVOS looks in the direction of the horn, then hands his head.
TYRION (to THEON): Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf’s height thinks he’s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf’s height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You’re all making the same five or six jokes.
THEON: It was a long time ago.
TYRION: It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.
THEON: I didn’t murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
YARA: And he paid for them.
TYRION: Doesn’t seem like it. He’s still alive. It was complicated for you, I’m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we?
DAENERYS: You’ve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?
THEON: Not my claim. Hers.
DAENERYS: And what’s wrong with you?
THEON: I’m not fit to rule.
TYRION: We can agree upon that at least.
DAENERYS: Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
YARA: No more than Westeros.
DAENERYS smiles.
THEON: Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
DAENERYS: Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
YARA: You and I have that in common.
DAENERYS: We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
DAENERYS turns to TYRION.
DAENERYS: Will their ships be enough?
TYRION: With the former Masters’ fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.
THEON: There are and Euron is building more. He’s going to offer them to you.
DAENERYS: So why shouldn’t I wait for him?
THEON: The Iron Fleet isn’t all he’s bringing. He also wants to give you --
YARA: His big cock, I think he said. Euron’s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won’t get one without the other.
DAENERYS: And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
YARA: I never demand, but I’m up for anything, really.
THEON: He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He’ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
TYRION: The Seven Kingdoms.
THEON: All of them.
DAENERYS: And you don’t want the Seven Kingdoms?
THEON: Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
DAENERYS: And that’s all?
YARA: We’d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don’t think a woman’s fit to rule.
DAENERYS: Reasonable.
TYRION: What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
DAENERYS: She’s not demanding, she’s asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to leave the world better than we found it.
DAENERYS stands and approaches YARA.
DAENERYS: You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.
YARA: That’s our way of life.
DAENERYS: No more.
YARA and THEON look at each other. THEON nods. YARA turns back to DAENERYS.
YARA: No more.
YARA extends her hand to DAENERYS. DAENERYS looks back at TYRION. TYRION makes a shaking motion with his hand. DAENERYS and YARA grab each other’s arms.
RAMSAY: Do you like games, little man? Let’s play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That’s it. That’s the game. Easy. Ready? Go.
RICKON starts walking out into the field, then looks back at RAMSAY.
RAMSAY: No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules.
A soldier approaches and hands RAMSAY his bow. RICKON starts running across the field. RAMSAY draws an arrow from his quiver. JON SNOW jumps on his horse and begins galloping across the field towards RICKON. RAMSAY notches an arrow and fires. The arrow lands in the ground next to RICKON. RAMSAY fires another arrow. It lands on the ground next to RICKON. JON SNOW and RICKON are getting closer. JON SNOW extends his hand out to RICKON. RAMSAY shoots another arrow. It misses. JON SNOW and RICKON are feet away from each other. An arrow pierces through RICKON’s chest from behind. RICKON falls to the ground. JON comes to a halt beside him and looks down at him. RICKON gasps and then dies. JON SNOW looks up at RAMSAY.
TORMUND (to himself): Don’t.
RAMSAY smiles and gives his bow back to the soldier.
DAVOS: Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!
The Bolton archers draw and loose a volley of arrows. JON SNOW ushers his horse into a gallop straight towards the Bolton army.
DAVOS: Go! Go! Follow your commander!
TORMUND: Run and fight!
WUN WUN roars. The bulk of the Stark forces charge across the field towards the Boltons. JON SNOW continues to rush the Bolton forces alone. The Bolton arches released a volley of arrows, some of which land in the body of JON SNOW’s horse, causing him and his horse to tumble to the ground.
RAMSAY: Now.
KARSTARK: Cavalry, charge!
JON SNOW stands to face the Bolton cavalry, charging at him. He takes off his sword belt and draws his sword. The cavalry approaches. Just before it’s upon him, the Stark forces rush past JON SNOW and collide with the Bolton charge. Men on both sides die in the frenzy. Bodies and weaponry fly everywhere. Archers on both sides of the battlefield nock arrows and draw their bows.
DAVOS: We’ll just kill our own men. Stand down.
The Stark arches do not fire.
RAMSAY: Loose!
The Bolton archers fire. Their arrows rain down on Stark and Bolton men alike. In the fray, JON SNOW dodges several horses which gallop past him. One Bolton cavalryman charges with his horse, but JON SNOW cuts him down. JON SNOW rushes forward and kills a man on the ground, then slices the belly of a second man. A volley of arrows rains down around JON SNOW. He ducks. None of the arrows hit him. He returns to his feet and cuts down another man, dodges the strike of a passing Bolton cavalryman, and runs through another Bolton footsoldier. A Stark footsoldier helps him finish the Bolton man, and JON SNOW grabs him by the shirt.
JON SNOW: Get word --
The Stark footsoldier is taken in the head by an arrow. JON SNOW stares down at the man and then flies into a rage, killing two more Bolton soldiers. A third man runs at him but is knocked down by a galloping horse. JON SNOW runs over to where he landed and stabs him several times. A horseman gallops at JON SNOW with his ax ready, but a passing Stark cavalryman spears him. Another Bolton footsoldier approaches JON SNOW, but JON SNOW cuts him down. The bodies are beginning to pile up on the battlefield. RAMSAY’s archers loose several more volleys. JON SNOW goes into a frenzy, killing many Bolton men. The bodies have piled up high enough to create small mountains of bodies. Men continue to fight atop and around them.
DAVOS: We may as well be taking shits back here.
DAVOS dismounts his horse.
DAVOS: Follow!
DAVOS unsheathes his sword and charges across the field. The remainder of the Stark forces charge after him. On the other side of the battlefield, RAMSAY smiles and acknowledges SMALLJON.
RAMSAY: It’s time, go.
SMALLJON brandishes his sword and walks back and forth in front of his men.
SMALLJON: Who owns the North?
ALL: We do!
SMALLJON: Who owns the North?
ALL: We do!
SMALLJON: Show me!
SMALLJON and his men cheer and charge across the battlefield. JON SNOW continues fighting, but is knocked to the ground by a Bolton footsoldier. TORMUND appears and stabs the footsoldier through the back, then helps JON SNOW to his feet.
TORMUND: Hey!
WUN WUN and the Wildlings charge up behind TORMUND and JON SNOW. SMALLJON and his men are charging from the other side. WUN WUN points at them and grunts. A force of Bolton men appear bearing tall shields and spears. They create a half-circle around JON SNOW, TORMUND, DAVOS, WUN WUN, and the entire Stark forces. The other half of the circle is blocked by the piles of bodies on the battlefield. The shield soldiers set their shields firmly in the dirt, then point their spears inward towards the Stark forces.
MAN: Infantry, advance!
The shield soldiers grunt in unison, lift their shields, and move in towards the Stark forces. With each wave of movement, they stab more and more Stark soldiers with their spears. One Stark soldier tries to climb up over the piles of bodies but gets cut down by SMALLJON. SMALLJON and his men charge down over the bodies, taking the Stark forces from the rear.
DAVOS: With me, lads! Break their line!
WUN WUN rushes the shield wall and swipes at the spears. TORMUND jumps to the side of some spears and attacks a man behind the shield wall. Several other Stark men rush towards the shield wall. JON SNOW and other Stark soldiers defend against SMALLJON’s men. Many soldiers die on both sides, and the bodies begin to pile up again. WUN WUN rips a man in half. TORMUND pulls a shieldbearer down and kills him, but gets sliced across the arm and is fored to fall back among the Stark ranks.
MAN: Tormund!
MAN #2: Get him back!
The shieldbearers advance, pushing the Stark forces further in on themselves. More Stark men die.
TORMUND: Fuck this, come on!
TORMUND leads the Wildlings back towards the piles of bodies. JON SNOW and SMALLJON spot each other, but before they can engage, the Wildling charge overtakes them. In the fray, JON SNOW is pushes to the bottom of several bodies and starts getting crushed. He struggles to get out, but can’t get a hold. TORMUND faces off against SMALLJON. TORMUND punches SMALLJON in the face, and SMALLJON responds with an overhead swing of his sword. TORMUND blocks it. More and more bodies are piling on top of JON SNOW. He can see glimpses of clashes and flailing limbs above, but nothing else. He gasps for air. SMALLJON knocks TORMUND to the ground and punches him in the face multiple times. Men are dying all around JON SNOW as he is being trampled. JON SNOW grabs onto the clothes of a standing men and hoists himself up. He emerges in the center of a tightly packed group of his men and fills his lungs with air. He spots WUN WUN fighting off some shieldbearers. WUN WUN is stabbed in the side, grunts, and pulls the spear out. SMALLJON repeatedly headbutts TORMUND in the face. DAVOS and JON SNOW look at each other. A horn begins to sound in the distance. SMALLJON stops headbutting TORMUND. TORMUND seizes the opportunity and tears into the skin of SMALLJON’s neck with his teeth, then draws a small knife and stabs SMALLJON repeatedly. RAMSAY looks in the direction of the sounding horn. A force of cavalry appears across the battlefield carrying flags bearing the white falcon sigil of House Arryn. SANSA and PETYR BAELISH sit on horseback beside the charging Arryn cavalry. TORMUND kills SMALLJON and screams. The Arryn cavalry takes the Bolton shieldbearers from the rear, then circles around and knocks them all down. SANSA smiles. JON SNOW climbs up to the top of the piles of bodies and spots RAMSAY on his horse. WUN WUN and TORMUND climb up beside JON SNOW. RAMSAY sees JON SNOW, turns his horse around, and rides back towards Winterfell. JON SNOW, TORMUND, and WUN WUN chase after him. SANSA watches them go.
RAMSAY and several Bolton soldiers enter the courtyard through Winterfell’s main gate. Some men close and bar the gate behind them and they dismount.
RAMSAY: Their army’s gone.
MAN: Our army’s gone.
RAMSAY: We have Winterfell. They don’t have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.
Something thuds against the gate. RAMSAY turns to look at it. Several Bolton archers nock arrows. Several more thuds occur against the other side of the gate. WUN WUN busts a hole in the gate. BOLTON archers shoot arrows at his hand and down at his body over the side of the castle wall. WUN WUN roars and punches another hole in the gate. RAMSAY moves farther away from the gate’s interior. WUN WUN reaches in and grabs the wooden bar holding the gate, but a Bolton soldier throws a spear through the back of his hand. WUN WUN rips his hand away and then bursts through the gate, opening it. He sprints into the courtyard, then falls to his knees. The Bolton archers continue shooting arrows into him. He roars. Stark soldiers flood the courtyard and beginning killing the Bolton soldiers, quickly overtaking them. JON SNOW enters the courtyard and runs up beside WUN WUN. They look at each other. TORMUND runs up beside WUN WUN, on his other side. JON SNOW reaches out to WUN WUN, but RAMSAY shoots WUN WUN in the eye with an arrow, killing him.
RAMSAY (to JON SNOW): You suggested one on one combat, didn’t you?
Stark archers aim their bows at RAMSAY.
RAMSAY: I’ve reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.
RAMSAY notches an arrow. JON SNOW drops his sword and picks up a shield. RAMSAY aims at JON SNOW and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. RAMSAY nocks another arrow and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. RAMSAY nocks a third arrow and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. Before RAMSAY can nock a fourth arrow, JON SNOW overtakes him. JON SNOW bashes RAMSAY with his shield twice, knocking him over. JON SNOW drops his shield and jumps on top of RAMSAY, then punches him in the raise over and over. RAMSAY’s faces becomes mangled and bleeds. SANSA enters the courtyard. JON SNOW sees her and stops punching RAMSAY. He stands and walks away. The Bolton flags fall away from the walls of Winterfell and are replaced by Stark flags. MELISANDRE watches from a balcony. DAVOS, holding the charred stag statuette, stares up at her. Some Stark men carry RICKON’s body into the courtyard on a stretcher and stop in front of JON SNOW, TORMUND, and SANSA.
JON SNOW: We’re going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
The stretcher men continue on. JON SNOW turns to walk away.
SANSA: Jon.
JON SNOW turns back to face SANSA.
SANSA: Where is he?
RAMSAY is tied to a chair inside the kennel gates. He is mangled and bleeding. He groans and coughs, then raises his head to see SANSA standing outside the gate.
RAMSAY: Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I’ll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That’s all right. You can’t kill me. I’m part of you now.
SANSA: Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
The dogs growl in their cells and begin filtering out into the kennel.
RAMSAY: My hounds will never harm me.
SANSA: You haven’t fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
RAMSAY: They’re loyal beasts.
SANSA: They were. Now they’re starving.
The dogs growl. One approaches RAMSAY from the front and puts its front paws up on his legs. It sniffs RAMSAY’s face.
RAMSAY: Sit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!
The dog bites RAMSAY’s face. RAMSAY screams. The dogs converge on RAMSAY and begin tearing him apart. SANSA turns as though she might leave, but lingers for a moment to watch. SANSA turns and walks away, then smiles.

TOMMEN is being dressed by an attendant.
MARGAERY is being dressed by a handmaiden.
The HIGH SPARROW dresses himself in a roughspun tunic, sliding his hands through the sleeves one by one.
The attendant places a large golden necklace around TOMMEN’s neck.
The handmaiden finishes tying MARGAERY’s dress and fixes her hair.
The attendant places TOMMEN’s crown on top of his head. TOMMEN looks out the window.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
A pair of Faith Militant men open the main door to the Sept. A crowd of nobles filters inside.
LORAS sits in the back of his cell, muttering to himself. LANCEL and two other Faith Militant enter. LORAS cowers. The Faith Militant take hold of LORAS.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
The HIGH SPARROW and six other septons enter. They walk down the steps. MARGAERY appears in the crowd beside her father, MACE. She and the HIGH SPARROW exchange a glance as he walks by. The HIGH SPARROW and the other septons occupy seven chairs seated in a circle around the central chamber of the sept. MARGAERY looks around.
TOMMEN is sitting in a chair in the center of the room, looking out the window. His attendant enters.
ATTENDANT: Your Grace. The trial will be getting underway soon.
A handmaiden connects a golden chain between two golden shoulder fastenings on CERSEI’s dress.
TOMMEN says nothing. The attendant leaves.
The handmaiden places a ring on CERSEI’s middle finger.
PYCELLE is standing in front of a bureau. He picks up a piece of paper and reads it, then picks up his chain, places it around his neck, and looks in the mirror. A mistress lying on his bed stares at him in the reflection of the mirror.
MISTRESS: You got my money?
PYCELLE: Later. Go away.
The mistress stands and leaves. PYCELLE straightens himself out, sighs, and exits the room. In the hallway, he walks down a set of steps. A young girl appears on the steps behind him.
GIRL: Grand Maester.
PYCELLE turns back to look at her and walks over to her. He bends down and she whispers into his ear.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
LANCEL and a group of Faith Militant usher LORAS into the sept and down the steps. His hair has been shorn. MARGAERY stares at him. The Faith Militant lead him to the center of the room and move away. The HIGH SPARROW stands.
HIGH SPARROW: Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?
LORAS: There’ll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.
HIGH SPARROW: To which crimes will you be confessing?
LORAS: All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
The crowd murmurs.
LORAS: I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity… dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.
HIGH SPARROW: The gods’ judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her.
LORAS kneels.
LORAS: I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.
HIGH SPARROW: You understand fully what this means?
LORAS: I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.
HIGH SPARROW: Brother Loras…
LORAS begins to cry.
HIGH SPARROW: ...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.
The HIGH SPARROW touches LORAS’ face. LORAS looks up at him.
HIGH SPARROW: Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?
LORAS: I will.
The HIGH SPARROW smiles. The HIGH SPARROW nods. Two Faith Militant approach LORAS and take him by the arms. A third approaches him from behind, draws a knife, and begins carving the mark of the Seven into LORAS’ forehead. MACE stirs.
MACE: No, I can’t let them…
MARGAERY blocks her father with her arm.
MARGAERY: Faith is the way, Father.
LORAS whinces.
The handmaiden finishes dressing CERSEI and steps away from her.
Someone approaches TOMMEN.
TOMMEN: All right. I’m ready.
TOMMEN stands and turns around. GREGOR is standing in the doorway.
TOMMEN walks towards GREGOR. GREGOR puts his hand on TOMMEN’s shoulder, blocking his path.
The handmaiden exits. CERSEI looks over her shoulder.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
The Faith Militant has finished carving LORAS’s forehead. KEVAN watches from the crowd. MARGAERY has made her way to the floor in front of the HIGH SPARROW.
MARGAERY: You mutilated him. You gave me your word.
HIGH SPARROW: I’ve kept my word. Once the queen mother’s trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave.
MARGAERY: And where is the queen mother?
LANCEL: Her litter never left the Red Keep.
HIGH SPARROW: It appears the queen mother doesn’t wish to attend her own trial.
CERSEI pours herself a glass of wine.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
HIGH SPARROW (to LANCEL): Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.
LANCEL nods and exits with several Faith Militant.
CERSEI walks to the balcony with her glass of wine.
LANCEL emerges onto the steps with the Faith Militant. He sees a boy running down the steps. The boy looks over his shoulder at LANCEL.
LANCEL: Get the others.
The other Faith Militant disperse. LANCEL looks over the railing and sees the boy enter a door at the foot of the steps.
The young girl opens the door and leads PYCELLE inside. PYCELLE looks around.
LANCEL runs to the door the boy entered and then goes inside. It leads to a tunnel. LANCEL sees the boy running down the tunnel with a lit torch. He starts after the boy.
PYCELLE walks down the steps and into the lab, then turns around to see QYBURN sitting in a chair behind him.
PYCELLE: Where’s the king?
QYBURN stands.
QYBURN: Elsewhere, I’m afraid.
QYBURN: Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can.
PYCELLE turns around. A young boy emerges from the shadows with a knife.
LANCEL continues to follow the boy through the tunnels.
More children brandishing knives appear.
LANCEL runs down the tunnel after the boy.
QYBURN: This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest.
The girl who led PYCELLE into the room brandishes a knife.
LANCEL turns a corner and finds a smaller tunnel. He gets down on his hands and knees and crawls through it.
The children converge on PYCELLE. PYCELLE slaps one of them but is overwhelmed. The children stab him repeatedly with their knives, killing him. QYBURN watches.
LANCEL happens upon the boy’s torch and raises it up.
LANCEL: The longer you wait, the worse it’ll be for you.
LANCEL spies a side passageway lined with barrels. The boy sneaks up on him and stabs him in the side. LANCEL yells and falls to the ground. The boy runs away. LANCEL breathes heavily. The boy returns and looks at LANCEL.
LANCEL: What are you doing?
The boy runs away.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
The crowd is murmuring. MARGAERY looks around at them, then looks at LORAS. LORAS is hanging his head, his eyes downcast.
LANCEL looks down the tunnel and sees a glimmer of light. He drags himself through the dirt towards it.
CERSEI is standing at the balcony, staring out at the Great Sept of Baelor.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
MARGAERY looks around.
LANCEL crawls closer to the other end of the hall. There is a green glow all around him.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
MARGAERY hurries over to the HIGH SPARROW.
MARGAERY: There’s something wrong.
HIGH SPARROW: You have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly.
MARGAERY: Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?
HIGH SPARROW: If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--
MARGAERY: Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I’m telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave.
The HIGH SPARROW scoffs and shakes his head.
LANCEL has almost reached the end of the tunnel. He sees green pools of liquid on the ground in front of two barrels with candles in their centers. The candles have almost burned down to nothing. He looks around at the casks lining the walls of the tunnel and pulls himself onward towards the candles.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
MARGAERY (to the crowd): We all need to leave now!
MARGAERY hurries over to LORAS. The crowd begins to stir. MARGAERY takes LORAS’ chin and lifts his face so his eyes meet hers.
MARGAERY: Loras. Stay with me.
MARGAERY ushers him towards the steps.
LANCEL groans as he pulls himself closer to the candles.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
MARGAERY hurries towards the exit with LORAS. The crowd begins to panic and also heads towards the exit. Two Faith Militant block MARGAERY’s path to the exit.
MARGAERY: Let me through. Let me through. Get out of my way.
MARGAERY pushes against the guards. The HIGH SPARROW looks around at the crowd.
MARGAERY: Let us through!
LANCEL reaches the candles. He tries to blow out the flame with his breath, but it won’t go out.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
MARGAERY looks over her shoulder at the HIGH SPARROW. They stare into each other’s eyes.
The flame from the candle touches the pool of green liquid and ignites it. The surrounding barrels are ignited and explode in a mass of green flame. LANCEL is incinerated. The explosion travels down the tunnel, igniting all of the barrels.
CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
The sound of an explosion can be heard. The green flame erupts from the center of the sept, incinerating the HIGH SPARROW and then engulfing the entire sept, killing everyone inside. The sept crumbles from the force of the explosion. The bell from its tower is flung down into the city, smashing into a bystander. The flames rush out from the sept.
CERSEI watches the explosion. She cocks her head back, then smiles, sips her wine, and walks away.
GREGOR is standing in the hallway.TOMMEN is staring out the window at the explosion with his mouth hanging open. GREGOR exits.
SEPTA UNELLA is lying strapped to a table. CERSEI stands over her and pours wine in her face. SEPTA UNELLA sputters and struggles against her bindings.
CERSEI: Confess. Confess.
CERSEI raises a pitcher of wine over SEPTA UNELLA’s head.
SEPTA UNELLA: No.
CERSEI: Confess.
CERSEI pours the pitcher into SEPTA UNELLA’s face. SEPTA UNELLA sputters and struggles. When the pitcher is empty, SEPTA UNELLA gasps for air.
CERSEI: Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.
CERSEI touches SEPTA UNELLA’s face.
CERSEI: You’ve always been quiet.
CERSEI walks around the table.
CERSEI: I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?
SEPTA UNELLA: Good. I’m glad to see your face. I’m ready to meet the gods.
CERSEI: What? Now? Today? You’re not going to die today. You’re not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.
GREGOR enters the room.
CERSEI: This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He’s quiet, too.
SEPTA UNELLA looks at GREGOR. GREGOR removes his helmet. His face is cloaked in shadow.
CERSEI: Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.
CERSEI walks towards the exit. GREGOR enters. His face is purple and mangled. He puts his helmet down on the table next to SEPTA UNELLA.
SEPTA UNELLA: No.
SEPTA UNELLA struggles against her bindings, then cries out in pain.
CERSEI: Shame.
CERSEI take hold of the door and closes it behind her.
CERSEI: Shame.
SEPTA UNELLA screams.
CERSEI: Shame.
CERSEI closes the latch on the door’s porthole and walks away. SEPTA UNELLA screams.
TOMMEN is staring out the window.
ATTENDANT: I’m very sorry, Your Grace. Very sorry.
The attendant exits. TOMMEN takes his crown off his head and walks to another part of the room. He returns to the window, stands up on the sill, and plummets off the edge.
INT. THE TWINSA banquet is underway. WALDER FREY is making a toast. JAIME and BRONN sit at the tables with the Frey and Lannister men, listening.
WALDER: For House Lannister!
MEN: Hear me roar!
The men cheer.
WALDER: For House Frey!
MEN: We stand together!
The men cheer.
WALDER: May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last.
The men cheer.
WALDER: And when we drive our swords through our enemies’ hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance, “The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards.”
The men cheer. A handmaiden looks at BRONN and then at JAIME.
BRONN: You don’t even have to do anything, do you?
JAIME looks at the handmaiden.
BRONN: You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking.
JAIME: You’re welcome to her.
BRONN: She doesn’t want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
JAIME nods at two women standing on the other side of the room.
JAIME: Those two have their eyes on you.
BRONN looks at the women.
BRONN: They have their eyes on you, cunt.
JAIME: Not my type.
BRONN: Not blonde enough?
JAIME: Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
JAIME looks at BRONN.
JAIME: There you go.
BRONN: Maybe I’m not in the mood.
The girls approach Bronn.
BRONN: Fuck it.
BRONN stands and approaches the girls.
BRONN: No need to call me ser just because I’m an anointed knight.
WALDER sits down next to JAIME.
WALDER: This came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.
JAIME: I’m sure he would be.
WALDER: Edmure is back in a cell. Can’t go killing my son by law. It wouldn’t be right. Give the family a bad name.
WALDER sips his wine.
WALDER: So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said.
JAIME: Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?
WALDER: I’m a bit old for all that.
JAIME: No, but back in your day.
WALDER: The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn’t it?
JAIME nods.
WALDER: I’ve defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it’s mine. What do you call that? Victory.
JAIME: Yes, you’re a great conqueror.
WALDER: Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you’re an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn’t matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it’s like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don’t mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing.
JAIME: They don’t fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?
JAIME stands and exits. WALDER watches him go.
CERSEI and QYBURN are standing over TOMMEN’s body. His body is covered in a veil.
CERSEI: Show me.
QYBURN: Your Grace, there’s no need--
CERSEI: Show me.
QYBURN uncovers TOMMEN’s body. CERSEI stares at it.
QYBURN: What are your thoughts concerning the king’s funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?
CERSEI: He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.
CUT TO: THE CITADEL
SAM and GILLY enter and walk to the front desk. A maester is sitting behind the desk, holding spectacles up to his eyes and reading.
SAM: Hello.
The maester keeps reading and then looks up at SAM, removing his spectacles.
SAM: From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
SAM holds up a letter. The maester puts down his spectacles and opens his palm. SAM reaches across the table with the letter, offering it to the maester. The maester does not retrieve it. SAM presses himself against the desk, leans further in, and places the letter directly in the maester’s hand. The maester takes the letter, breaks the seal, and reads it.
The maester looks at SAM and then opens a large book. He flips a few pages.
MAESTER: Oh.
The maester points his finger to a line of text on the open page.
MAESTER: According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.
SAM: He died.
MAESTER: We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
SAM: Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He’s since passed away. Which is why I’m here.
MAESTER: This is irregular.
SAM: Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular.
The maester stares blankly at SAM, then picks up a quill and crosses off two lines of text in the open book.
MAESTER: The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library. Follow me.
The maester stands and begins walking away. SAM and GILLY start to follow him. He turns back and looks at GILLY.
MAESTER:  No women or children!
The maester turns and walks away. SAM makes several baffled gestures to GILLY and then follows the maester. They enter a small hallway full of books. The maester stops in front of a dark side passage and gestures towards it. SAM starts down the passage. The maester leaves. On his way through, SAM touches several of the books lining the shelves. SAM emerges onto the other side of the passage. The passage opens onto an enormous library with a chandelier dangling from the ceiling that reflects light. SAM gets teary and smiles.
JON SNOW is standing behind the high table, staring across the hall. MELISANDRE stands by his side.
JON SNOW: When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I’d sit down there.
JON SNOW points to the other end of the hall.
MELISANDRE: Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts.
JON SNOW chuckles.
JON SNOW: Aye, you’re right. I was luckier than most.
DAVOS enters the hall and tosses the charred stag statuette at MELISANDRE. MELISANDRE catches it.
JON SNOW: What is that?
DAVOS: Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
MELISANDRE: The Princess Shireen.
DAVOS: Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!
MELISANDRE: We burned her at the stake.
DAVOS: Why?
MELISANDRE: The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
DAVOS: You burned a little girl alive!
MELISANDRE: I only do what my Lord commands!
DAVOS: If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!
MELISANDRE: We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
DAVOS: I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
MELISANDRE: So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
DAVOS: The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied.
MELISANDRE: I didn’t lie. I was wrong.
DAVOS: Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?
DAVOS and MELISANDRE stare at each other in silence.
DAVOS (to JON SNOW): I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
JON SNOW (to MELISANDRE): Do you have anything to say for yourself?
MELISANDRE: I’ve been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he’s not. You’ve seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war.
JON SNOW approaches MELISANDRE.
JON SNOW: Ride south today. If you return to the North, I’ll have you hanged as a murderer.
MELISANDRE puts the stag statuette down on the high table and begins to walk away. DAVOS moves in her way.
DAVOS: If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself.
MELISANDRE moves past DAVOS and exits.
JON SNOW stands atop the outer wall watching MELISANDRE ride south on her horse. SANSA appears.
JON SNOW: I’m having the lord’s chamber prepared for you.
SANSA: Mother and Father’s room? You should take it.
JON SNOW: I’m not a Stark.
SANSA: You are to me.
JON SNOW: You’re the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We’re standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
SANSA: He did.
JON SNOW: And you trust him?
SANSA: Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I’m sorry.
JON SNOW approaches SANSA.
JON SNOW: We need to trust each other. We can’t fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
JON SNOW touches SANSA’s face and kisses her on the forehead, then turns to walk away.
SANSA: Jon.
JON SNOW turns back to face SANSA.
SANSA: A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.
JON SNOW smiles and looks up at the sky.
JON SNOW: Well, Father always promised, didn’t he?
JON SNOW exits. SANSA looks out at the wilderness.
OLENNA: The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?
ELLARIA: You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.
OLENNA: You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?
OBARA: We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
OLENNA: What is your name again? Barbaro?
OBARA: Obara.
OLENNA: Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don’t presume to tell me what I need.
NYMERIA: Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--
OLENNA: Do shut up, dear.
OLENNA looks at TYENE.
OLENNA: Anything from you?
TYENE opens her mouth to speak.
OLENNA: No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
ELLARIA: The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
OLENNA: Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I’m after now.
ELLARIA: You’re absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart’s desire.
ELLARIA rings a bell.
OLENNA: And what is my heart’s desire?
ELLARIA: Vengeance. Justice.
VARYS emerges from a hallway.
VARYS: Fire and blood.
DAARIO: Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.
DAARIO pours himself a glass of wine.
DAARIO: I’m curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
DAENERYS: You’re not coming with us.
DAARIO: New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King’s Landing.
DAARIO approaches DAENERYS and stands in front of her.
DAENERYS: You’re not going to Westeros. You’re staying here with the Second Sons. There’s finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
DAARIO sets his glass of wine down on a table.
DAARIO: Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I’m here for you, not them.
DAENERYS: You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I’m going to rule in Westeros, I’ll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage.
DAARIO sits down.
DAARIO: Who are you marrying this time?
DAENERYS: I don’t know. Maybe no one.
DAARIO: But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
DAENERYS: I can’t bring a lover to Westeros.
DAARIO: A king wouldn’t think twice about it.
DAENERYS: So that’s what you want? To be my mistress?
DAARIO: I’m not proud. I don’t care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don’t want a crown. I want you.
DAARIO approaches DAENERYS and kneels in front of her.
DAARIO: I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
DAENERYS touches DAARIO’s face.
DAENERYS: I can’t.
DAARIO stands.
DAARIO: The dwarf told you to do this.
DAENERYS: No one tells me to do anything.
DAARIO: Clever fellow. Can’t argue with his logic. I’m no use to you over there.
DAENERYS: Don’t get angry.
DAARIO: I’m not angry. I’m full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?
DAENERYS: A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.
DAENERYS stands.
DAARIO: Bay of Dragons?
DAENERYS: We can’t call it Slaver’s Bay anymore, can we?
DAARIO: You’ll get that throne you want so badly, I’m sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness.
DAARIO sips his wine.
DAARIO: I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what’s coming for them.
DAENERYS: Farewell, Daario Naharis.
DAARIO nods and exits.
TYRION is sitting off to the side of the room on a bench. DAENERYS enters, walking down the steps from the throne.
TYRION: How did he take it?
DAENERYS: No tears.
TYRION: I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it’s any consolation.
DAENERYS reaches the bottom of the steps and approaches TYRION.
DAENERYS: It’s not.
TYRION: No, I suppose not. I’m terrible at consoling.
DAENERYS sits down on the bench next to TYRION.
DAENERYS: Yes, you really are.
TYRION: All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It’s all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?
DAENERYS nods.
TYRION: Good. You’re in the great game now. And the great game’s terrifying. The only people who aren’t afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
DAENERYS: Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
TYRION: He wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last.
DAENERYS: Well, you have completely failed to console me.
DAENERYS stands and turns to face TYRION.
TYRION stands on the bench.
TYRION: I believe in you. It’s embarrassing, really. I’d swear you my sword, but I don’t actually own a sword.
DAENERYS: It’s your counsel I need.
TYRION: It’s yours. Now and always.
DAENERYS: Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I’m not sure if it’s right.
DAENERYS pins a Hand of the King’s brooch on TYRION’s chest.
DAENERYS: Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen.
TYRION holds back tears, then kneels.
INT. THE TWINSWALDER FREY is sitting at the high table, eating and drinking. The rest of the dining hall is empty. A handmaiden approaches and sets down a platter of pie on the table in front of him.
WALDER: You’re not one of mine, are you?
HANDMAIDEN: No, my lord.
WALDER: Didn’t think so. Too pretty.
WALDER slaps the handmaiden on the buttocks and smiles.
WALDER: Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
HANDMAIDEN: They’re here, my lord.
WALDER: Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now.
HANDMAIDEN: But they’re already here, my lord.
WALDER looks around the hall. The handmaiden points to the pie.
HANDMAIDEN: Here, my lord.
WALDER pulls back the top layer of the pie. A finger protrudes from the center of the slice.
HANDMAIDEN: They weren’t easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.
WALDER breathes heavily.
WALDER: What…
The handmaiden reaches up to her face and pulls it away, revealing her true identity is ARYA.
ARYA: My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you’re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
ARYA brandishes a knife. WALDER gets up to run, but ARYA grabs him and pulls him back down. She grabs him by the forehead and slits his throat. He convulses and groans as he dies. ARYA smiles and stares at him.
PETYR: Forgive me, my lady… if you’re at prayer.
SANSA: I’m done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had.
SANSA stands and walks towards PETYR.
SANSA: I was a stupid girl.
PETYR: You were a child.
SANSA: What do you want?
PETYR: I thought you knew what I wanted.
SANSA: I was wrong.
PETYR: No, you weren’t. Every time I’m faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side.
PETYR leans in to kiss SANSA, but SANSA puts her hand on his chest to stop him.
SANSA: It’s a pretty picture.
SANSA walks past PETYR.
PETYR: News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I’ve declared for House Stark for all to hear.
SANSA: You’ve declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It’s never stopped you from serving yourself.
PETYR: The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?
SANSA exits.
EXT. BEYOND THE WALLBENJEN stares up at The Wall. BRAN and MEERA wait nearby.
BENJEN: This is where I leave you.
MEERA: You’re not coming with us?
BENJEN: The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass.
BENJEN approaches his horse and lifts BRAN off of it. He carries BRAN to the foot of a nearby weirwood, then walks back to his horse.
MEERA: Where will you go?
BENJEN: The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I’ll do what I can… as long as I can.
BENJEN mounts his horse.
BRAN: Thank you, Uncle Benjen.
BENJEN: I wish you both good fortune.
BENJEN rides away. BRAN looks at the weirwood and then starts to crawl towards it. MEERA helps him. BRAN reaches out to the weirwood but MEERA grabs his wrist.
MEERA: Are you sure you’re ready for this?
BRAN:I’m the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.
BRAN touches the weirwood tree.
LYANNA: Ned?
NED: Lyanna.
NED rushes to LYANNA’s side.
LYANNA: Is that you? Is that really you?
LYANNA lifts her hand. NED takes it.
LYANNA: You’re not a dream.
NED: No, I’m not a dream. I’m here. Right here.
LYANNA: I’ve missed you, big brother.
NED begins to cry.
NED: I’ve missed you, too.
LYANNA: I want to be brave.
NED: Shh. You are.
LYANNA: I’m not.
NED lifts his hand from LYANNA’s stomach. His palm is covered in blood.
LYANNA: I don’t want to die.
NED: You’re not going to die.
NED looks at the handmaiden.
NED: Get her some water!
LYANNA: No, no water.
NED: Is there a maester?
LYANNA: Please. Listen to me, Ned.
LYANNA whispers in NED’s ear.
LYANNA: If Robert finds out, he’ll kill him, you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me.
The handmaiden hands NED the child.
LYANNA: Promise me, Ned. Promise me.
NED stares down at the baby. The baby opens its eyes. Zoom on the baby’s face.
VALE KNIGHT: You can’t expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.
TORMUND: We didn’t invade. We were invited.
VALE KNIGHT: Not by me.
JON SNOW stands.
JON SNOW: The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.
One of the houses’ representatives stands.
MAN: The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it’ll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.
JON SNOW: The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won’t wait out the storm. He brings the storm.
The men begin to murmur. LYANNA MORMONT stands.
LYANNA: Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don’t care if he’s a bastard. Ned Stark’s blood runs through his veins. He’s my king from this day until his last day.
The men resume murmuring. LORD MANDERLY stands.
MANDERLY: Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn’t think we’d find another king in my lifetime. I didn’t commit my men to your cause ‘cause I didn’t want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North.
MANDERLY draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels. LORD GLOVER stands.
GLOVER: I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.
JON SNOW: There’s nothing to forgive, my lord.
GLOVER: There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow… the King in the North!
GLOVER draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels.
GLOVER: The King in the North!
Everyone in the hall stands and draws their blades.
ALL: The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
JON SNOW stands. SANSA and PETYR look at each other.
JAIME: Come on.
JAIME rides on.
CERSEI enters, escorted by GREGOR and the Kingsguard. The room is full of nobles and city soldiers. QYBURN stands next to the Iron Throne, holding a crown. CERSEI and GREGOR approach the throne. CERSEI stands in front of the throne. JAIME enters through a side passage and watches.
QYBURN: I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.
QYBURN places the crown on CERSEI’s head. CERSEI sits in the Iron Throne. She and JAIME look at each other.
QYBURN: Long may she reign.
ALL: Long may she reign.
EXT. SUMMER SEATHEON and YARA are standing on their ship. They look out at the sea. A vessel appears with a dragon as its ram. GREY WORM and the Unsullied are riding in it. Hundreds of other ships are sailing around them. Some of the ships carry the Dothraki and their horses. DROGON, VISERION, and RHAEGAL fly overhead. They fly over the boat leading the convoy DAENERYS, TYRION, VARYS, and MISSANDEI are riding in it. DAENERYS and TYRION look at each other, then DAENERYS looks out at the ocean ahead. The dragons screech.
